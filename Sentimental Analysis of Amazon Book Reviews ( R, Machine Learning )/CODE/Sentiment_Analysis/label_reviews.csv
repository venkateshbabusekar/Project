5,"DJ","October 24, 2016","Having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now, I've seen scores of Smart devices come and go.  Until now, nobody quite got it right.  In the Echo Dot, Amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software.  I've seen plenty of the former, but truly seamless multi platform software has eluded everyone but Amazon.  We're talking major players like Samsung and Google who have been at it for much longer than Amazon.  The main problem is that excellent products like the Samsung Smart Things hub, which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies (Nest, Honeywell, Phillips, and so on), still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support I wanted, so I'd still end up needing my tablet or phone.  Thanks to fantastic third party support, the Dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music, order food, check the weather, listen to the radio, set alarms and timers, all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands.  To me, this is the exceedingly rare product that I didn't know I needed, and now can't live without.  Similar to the smartphone and tablet I use every day that didn't exist just a few short years ago.If you're even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try.  Add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be!Update:  After a bit more time with the dot, or maybe I should say dots since I went out and bought another one for my living room, I've come up with a few tips.1.  Use the best speakers you can with it.  I found that while Bluetooth was convenient I got much better sound out of my JBL duet computer speakers.2.  Take the time to voice train Alexa at least once.  It's kinda tedious but really improves the accuracy.  I've now gone through three trainings with each dot, the phrasing gets more intricate with each, and it really is amazing how much of an improvement it makes.  Kinda hard to quantify, but I'd guess Alexa is at least twice as likely to understand long, complex phrases and has also gained noticeable accuracy when ambient noise I'd present.3.  If a phrase doesn't yield the results you're looking for, reword it and try again.  For instance, ""Alexa, lower the temperature to 75 degrees"" got no result, so I tried ""Alexa, Honeywell Thermostat, 75 degrees"" and she picked it up perfectly.4.  Take the time to look through all the skills.  There's a lot of helpful and just plain fun stuff in there, from strange facts to a calculator and everything in between, that really helps to enhance the experience.5.  I'd never really used my prime music prior to setting up my dots.  Now I can't live without it!  I can say basically whatever I want and I get a result.  My favs so far:  ""Alexa, play 90s music"", ""Alexa, play indie music"", and ""Alexa, play thunderstorm sounds"".  The last one I ask to repeat and it plays all night.  Really a great ""freebie"" if you're a prime member.6.  I was a bit worried initially that Alexa might be triggered accidentally by ambient TV or general household noise, so I'm really impressed that it's only happened twice so far.  Both times in my living room when I was watching TV at high volume.  If it's a concern, the mic can be temporarily disabled, so the dot won't trigger and listen accidentally.7.  I've had no problem pairing the dot to a variety of devices including:  two different Bluetooth speakers, my Galaxy S7 edge, and pioneer receiver.  I need to look into it further, but each time I paired my phone the Bluetooth connection to the speaker was lost, so I ended up having to listen to the built in speaker.  Definitely not ideal for music, but no big deal if you're using wired speakers.  Plus, most Bluetooth sets offer an auxiliary input for wired listening.8.  It's fun to ask Alexa general questions to see if she's capable of finding the answers.  So far I've gotten accurate responses to ""Alexa, what's the definition of"", ""Alexa, how far away is"", ""Alexa, Wikipedia"" (just about anything you can think of and she'll tell you more if you ask ""Alexa, tell me more"").  If you have the time, ask her a set of questions and you'll quickly get used to her nuances.9.  Even though the microphones are extremely sensitive and quite accurate, I've found that the Dot works best when placed on a surface that's close to the level of the person speaking to it.  Generally speaking, three to five feet off the ground.  Alexa had some trouble hearing my requests when the dot was placed above or behind me.  If you'd like to place the dot higher, it works much better when flush with the wall, instead of sitting on a shelf etc.  I tried both setups and found with a couple nails set apart to make a cradle facing the dot out towards the room works best for me (sorry for the run on sentence lol).Suggestions for Improvement:1.  Unlike the upcoming Google Home BT speaker, the Dot and other Alexa devices are unable to answer general web queries.  They do a decent job of answering factual questions like ""How far away is the sun"" but I'd really like too see Amazon add a ""search"" function.2.  Not Amazon's fault, but several of the news briefing skills update infrequently and volume levels vary enough that I'd find myself constantly changing the volume level to match.3.  I enabled briefings from several outlets like NPR, BBC, AP, and so on.  I'd suggest you pick one or two and stick with them, otherwise you'll here the same news over and over.  I ended up going with BBC and AP briefings.",0.742857142857143,"positive"
5,"Bryant R.","January 10, 2017","So I don't normally write reviews but I just has to this time. Recently, I lost my cat best friend to cancer 2 days after Christmas. It was the worst day of my life. Imagine losing your friend that's been with you through every breakup, every apartment, nearly being homeless and more. When he passed I felt such an emptiness in my home.A few days ago I was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the Amazon Echo on the Amazon app. I remember watching a Mr. Robot episode where some FBI agent who suffers from insomnia was using Alexa to keep her entertained.So I started researching YouTube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it. It arrived today and the setup was super easy. I immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news. Then I discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and I completely fell in love with it. It's almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down. It suggested new music which I actually liked and the built in speaker isn't bad at all for the price.The Amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat kouga but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now. I added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like.I would totally recommend buying this product. I don't see any negatives other than the fact you can't really ask it followup questions like google assistant but I'm sure they'll make it happen.Thanks for letting me rant",0.476190476190476,"negative"
5,"RaVen","October 24, 2016","Thanks for taking the time to read this review!This re-release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam. Although slightly smaller then last years release, this device now picks up your voice even better! Im talking litterally talking leaps and bounds better. I can now say ""alexa"" and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im blaring music thru my Harmon Kardon Onyx speaker. I found myself yelling at last years  Echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen.  We will be ordering a second device so we can try out its ""multi-room voice recognition"" technology. Amazon claims to have instilled a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices. So bassically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word ""alexa"" on a side note The basic Amazon Music Unlimited will only work on ONE of your devices. Not one at a time, but ONE. If you want to use it on more than one Dot or Echo, you have to purchase a ""multi-device"" plan: https://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/promotions/AmazonMusicUnlimited  The main selling point of this device is you can use any of your exsisting bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar,or you can use the 3.5mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating. (At your own risk of course). I have both the amazon tap and the echo. Unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction.hence the bluetooth and the 3.5mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the pickiest of listeners to appreciate their music thru exsisting devices. I will mention that the echo dot does have a very strong bluetooth signal so devices placed within a foot of this device had issues connecting. Once those bluetooth speakers were moved a few feet away they worked perfectly.The echo dot does have a built in speaker but it does sound tinny. It definitely works for light bedroom or kitchen use.  At 50$ I was not expecting a whole lot. However amazon seriously went above and beyond to offer this incredible device at half the cost of last years model. And as stated above,it actually works better! I can also confirm that its connectivity with our in home smart devices. Works well with our TP Link smart plug so if I come home to a dark house, all I have to say is ""alexa turn on the lights"" and our downstairs lights spring into action.  My only negatives were with the actual alexa app as it really gave me fits during setup only on my samsung s2 tablet. Spent a good 5-6 minutes and never got it to setup correctly. However the alexa app on my galaxy s6 phone found and paired the echo with ease. Just a weird quirk. Also Alexa still has her quirks. unless you phrase some questions correctly she still responds with ""sorry I didn't get that""Alexa is still a developing search engine so My hopes is that she will continue to grow as even more users jump onto these incredible amazon devices.Prime music is our prime application and hence this device meets our expectations.  Another thing to mention is the echo dot will not play your iTunes or google play music as of now. Those 2 companies are releasing devices of their own so as we all know they will push their own devices rather then make them compatible with a competing companies device. Amazon Prime music is a great added benefit for those of you that are existing Prime users so this device works well in giving you access to all of your ""free"" music.  I did a unboxing and setup and show you how this device works video on youtube. Just look up ""New Amazon echo dot 2nd gen 2016 release Unboxing"" under my channel LMMProductions to see this incredible device in action.  I will continue to update this review as I spend more time with this device.",0.775,"positive"
5,"Brian C","December 14, 2016","There's already a ton reviews for the Amazon Echo, but I just wanted say how happy we are with this product.I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen for the first floor of our 2- level condo and because it's a larger room than our bedrooms upstairs; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive big brother and too good to pass up. What I found was that the Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the first floor. It's hard to know if the sound will be loud enough or if Alexa could hear from all parts of the room just by seeing it at the retail store, but Alexa (Echo Dot) had no problems hearing and responding to our commands. We typically set the volume setting to volume level 7 and music is loud enough for us to hear everywhere. It helps to have it centrally located in the room, and I am no farther than 20 feet away from the device speaking at relatively normal voice volume.My wife, an initial skeptic, is really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. The only thing that is CON for me is that the Amazon Echo ""skills"" that can be learned still feels like in the infant stages and many of the ""skills"" not as polished. Certainly there are several companies that have helped designed some really good skills like Capital One, Fitbit, and Domino's, but there's still not a lot to choose from. I hope that more and more companies will jump on this quickly.Considering everything, for $40/$50 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to home automation and voice recognition technology, and overall, I would highly recommend this product.The product comes in a small package, and everything that comes in the box can be seen in pictures attached.",0.75,"positive"
5,"Peter E.","January 22, 2017","I love this!!!  When these first came out I didn't think it would be something I would use much.  At least, not until my whole house has smart appliances.My wife didn't want me to buy it she couldn't see the use for it.She became addicted to it the first night. Especially if you sign up for Amazon Prime Music which has a huge selection for about $4 a month.We've been watching less TV and listening to more music which is wonderful.I love using the shopping list and to do list feature.My 2.5 year old loves it and already talks to Alexa. We play kids song mixes they have and he dances away.The weather and time, calculations and conversions and Wikipedia are really helpful to have around.It's loud enough for a living room but I do want the full sized one eventually and move this to a bedroom.The voice recognition is amazingly good too. You don't have to pause for a moment after saying Alexa. Just speak as you would to anyone home. It's really impressive.You also don't notice it's even there, the design is so good.I can go on and on so let's just say I didn't think I would use it much but heard rave reviews from friends and love having it!!!",0.818181818181818,"positive"
5,"LUCY  Von","January 11, 2017","I got Dot about a week after the big Echo from my son as a gift. We set her up and all was fine. Until nothing eas fine anymore 😢 . She would respond initially, but not always though, and when she was playing music she would not respond to the wake word. At all. I reset, few times, but nithing worked. I called Amazon. Within minutes they had me connected to Echo's tech support, and in no time did we have Dot fixed. They reset her factory settings with me. We tested and now our darling little Dot is happy and healthy! So call Amazon if you do have issues, it's a matter of setup or wifi or in any case, something that they can fix. Wonderful support for a wondrful device. I do wish I could call her Dot though. Or a name that I choose. Because now I have two Alexa's in one household 🤔, and calling her Echo or Amazon ain't gonna work for me 😢. Please vote my review up if you liked it.",0.916666666666667,"positive"
4,"Lantana Al","October 24, 2016","Amazon Echo is a great device (I was one of the first to have one and waiting for months for my first Echo to ship as Amazon vastly underestimated the demand for a device like this) and the Echo Dot (2nd generation) is fantastic in its size and capability (I bought a six pack to get one free). There is no volume ring on the 2nd gen Dot like there is on the original Echo and the 1st gen Echo Dot but it's no big deal as there are volume buttons now and the cost of the volume ring wasn't worth it if you ask me (it was nice, but for most people not worth the money). Most of the time you'll want to adjust the volume by voice anyway (like ""Alexa volume 5""). The 2nd gen Echo Dot is also available in white but I'm sticking with black. UPDATE: I actually prefer the cheaper volume buttons on the Dot 2 to the volume ring now.The fact that you can just talk from across the room and it can hear you (most of the time) really sets this apart. If you think you already have an Echo because you have Siri, Cortana, or Google, then know that it's just not the same.Things I do: set timers, set alarms, get weather info, ask basic questions, listen to music (like Prime Music, Prime Stations, songs I bought, etc), listen to radio, ask for jokes, turn things on and off, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things. The Echo really excels at playing music. I love it than I can ask for a song I want to hear and it will play it (most of the time anyway). At night I often listen to a local radio station and I just say ""Alexa stop"" without having to get out of bed when I want to stop listening.When I listen to Prime Station I can tell it ""thumbs up"" if I like the song or ""thumbs down"" if I don't... and when I listen to the station again it won't play the songs that I've thumbed down.Using the built-in speaker, the sound quality is decent for voice. For music you'll want to connect it to a speaker system because the Dot's small internal speaker is weak. I do wish I could AirPlay to a device from the Echo when I'm playing music and want the best sound quality, however Bluetooth is pretty impressive when it uses the near-CD quality codecs.Positives:* The new feature that Amazon added (ESP - Echo Spatial Perception) so that the nearest Echo responds is fantastic. I was also very happy to hear that the first generation Echoes will also support this in the next firmware update (I think devices are updating now). From my research, if the Echo app shows that you have a device software version greater than 4008 then you should have the update with ESP support. Unfortunately there does seem to be a minor downside: the Echo's response can sometimes be slightly delayed while multiple Echoes figure out which Echo is closest and should respond.* It seems to hear better when playing music than the first gen. It was annoying when you would try to talk to it while it was playing but it couldn't hear you. The new Dot hears better during music playback but it's still not ""Star Trek quality"" hearing; sometimes you may still need to raise your voice.* It's relatively cheap and well worth the asking price.* It has a 3.5mm stereo audio jack, which I use with two of my Dots to connect to the line-in on one of my computers and another to the line-in on an old compact stereo/CD player. Sound quality should be good enough for anyone except audiophiles.* Some people complain of connection issues, but all of my Echoes stay connected without issue to my Asus RT-AC68U router.* If you want to 'Wikipedia' something then you can say 'Alexa, Wikipedia <subject>'. She'll read a little from Wikipedia. If you want her to read more after she stops then just say 'Alexa, tell me more'. This can be useful sometimes.Negatives (mostly minor but take note):* Warranty is only 90 days. I think it should be 1 year. Of course they will sell you a SquareTrade 1, 2, or 3 year warranty for $5/year if you want. Perhaps another cost-cutting move.* The shiny (glossy) black surface can be a fingerprint magnet but you probably won't be touching it often. The previous generation wasn't glossy.* I had trouble configured my 2nd Echo Dot (the first one went fine). The Alexa app (on Android) gave me the cryptic message ""Authorization expired. Please reconnect your phone to the internet, log out from the app and retry"". Got it several times. I resolved it by signing out of the Alexa app and then signing back in, having to re-enter my email and password.... annoying... and I wonder why I didn't have this issue setting up my first Echo Dot just minutes prior???? Oh well. UPDATE: This just happened again on another day when setting up two more Echo Dots. This first Echo Dot setup went fine, but on the second one I got the ""Authorization expired."" message again. Beware of this issue if setting up more than one Echo Dot.* While trying out Amazon Music Unlimited with the Echo I immediately ran into the issue of the Echo playing the explicit version of songs instead of the clean version. There should be an option to never play explicit songs and to play the clean version instead (some people have children). The workaround until Amazon addresses this problem is to add the clean song to your music library and then say ""Alexa play <song> from my library"".* This doesn't affect me, but the Echo does not support enterprise networks that require centralized network authentication with a login. Some might want to know this (like teachers who might want to use it in a school that uses this type of network authentication).* The Android Amazon Alexa app can be slow and frustrating sometimes. For example, when launching it sometimes just sits there on the intro screen and spins forever until you shut down the app and restart it again.* Doesn't hear well in a noisy environment, or when other people (including on TV) are talking at the same time.Home Automation:* I use several Belkin WeMo switches to control some lights and fans. They work pretty well although not always perfectly. Fortunately they work better now after all the firmware updates.* I can control my Honeywell WiFi thermostats using the ""Honeywell Total Connect Comfort"" skill. I have two downstairs for 2 zones. I have one Honeywell RTH9580WF1005/W1 and one Honeywell RTH6580WF.* I recently set it up to turn on and off certain activities with a Logitech Smart Hub. For example, I can say ""Alexa, turn on TiVo"" and it will turn on the TV and my receiver and set the TV and receiver inputs correctly. I can then use the remote which is synced... and turn it all off with ""Alexa turn off TiVo"". There were some annoyances getting it all setup but I think it's pretty ""cool"" even though you can only start and stop activities with Alexa so you still need the remote to do other things (change channel, adjust volume, mute, pause, etc).* I think I've only really scratched the surface of what is possible with home automation. I have not tried IFTTT (""if this then that"") recipes yet but I hear it is quite powerful and hope to try it out when I have more time to ""play"".Wishes:* High-quality digital audio output that is better than Bluetooth. If it had this then you could really get high quality audio output from it, but most people probably don't really care that much as analog out is ""good enough"".* Smarter. After 2 years I wish the Echo was smarter. Yes, it has definitely improved over time but Google can still answer more questions than Alexa. It's going to be hard to beat Google in answering general questions.* Weather alerts. I suggested this a long time ago and they still haven't added it... perhaps due to legal reasons? If would be great if it would sound some sort of alarm or notification for severe weather.* Built-in support for notifying others that you might need help. This would be good for the elderly. There is a ""Ask My Buddy"" skill however, but the verbiage is a little awkward (""Alexa, Ask My Buddy to Send Help"") and it's free so if the developer decides to stop support then that might leave a lot of people without service at an inopportune time.Compared to Google Home (which I just bought):* Setup on Google Home was super-simple, easier than Echo (the Android app worked really well and setup seemed streamlined)* Google Home is smarter for general questions... significantly smarter. I asked Google ""How long does it take to get to the Honda dealer in Lewisville"" and it told me about 26 minutes in current traffic conditions. Awesome. The Echo totally failed here.* No AUX audio output like on Echo Dot* I prefer saying ""Alexa"" to ""OK Google"" as the wake word (UPDATE: ""Hey Google"" works now too!)* I currently prefer Echo for music and smart home control but I consider Google Home a serious threat to Echo because it is more ""intelligent"" than EchoOther:* It doesn't come with a 3.5mm audio cable but I can understand why as many people would probably not use it and Amazon wants to get the cost as low as possible so this isn't a big deal.* The USB power cable is about 5 feet.* The 1st gen Echo Dot was almost double the price. I feel a little disappointed that they now have a 2nd gen that is overall better for much less money... and that it came out very shortly after the 1st gen Echo Dots.* You don't need any other Echo units to use the Dot... some people might think you do but this is just like the ""big Echo"", only without the ""big"" sound. Instead a little speaker is included.* It's USB powered and comes with a USB power adapter and USB cable. NOTE: If you use a USB power connection other than from the included power adapter then there could be power and/or sound quality issues. I had some sound quality issues (background noises) and eliminated them by switching to the included USB power adapter.* About 10 or 15 minutes after setting it up, it said something like ""your Echo received an important update and must restart"". So if you are having issues with it then you may want to give it awhile so it can update if needed.* For better understanding of what you say, go to the Alexa app and Settings->Voice Training.* I bought some of these powered bookshelf speakers, hooked them to the Echo Dot, and have been impressed with what you get for the money: Edifier R1280T Powered Bookshelf SpeakersWhile not perfect, I really like the Amazon Echo. I think the technology and potential is still in its infancy but the Echo is already really useful and excels at home automation, playing music, podcasts, and radio. Highly recommended, especially for the price. UPDATE: I'm reducing my rating from 4.5 to 4 stars due to Google Home being much smarter at answering general questions. The Echo is a good device but I think you should also seriously consider Google Home.",0.736842105263158,"positive"
3,"Robert Jones","April 6, 2017","I've been living with Alexa since the start of 2017, and it's been a mixed bag.

It controlled my lights, answered my questions, set timers and alarms.  Played music.Then, as many roommates, you learn about the real Alexa after some time.  If you want to make a fool out of yourself, ask Alexa something in front of a friend or a visitor.Once in five times, when I say ""Master Off"", it tells me about restaurants.

5,"Keirstyn G.","January 6, 2017","I would like to give a testimonial about this product my sisters and I purchased the echo Dot for my mother for Christmas who is handicapped. She stays at home by herself most days and has limited access to what she can do do to being legally blind and having a neurological disorder. Now she is able to do so many things for herself that she was unable to do for many many years. A few days after Christmas I walked over to her house in the morning to help her out and I could hear music playing and then I hear her yell out Alexa thumbs down that song. I laughed because she was upstairs laying in bed listening to music she said she'd been listening all morning and it made her so happy. This has really been a life-changing gift. Before this she was unable to turn on the TV herself or turn on her music and had a hard time with her tablet turning her audible books on now all she has to do is speak to Alexa and it has opened a whole new world for her",0.3,"negative"
4,"Axiom Brevity","January 18, 2017"," Hello Everyone,To start off my review I just wanted to mention that this product was not provided to me at a discount or free and I purchased it with my own funds.=========================================================================================================Price Point=========Fantastic! Why? Because if you're unsure of the uprising smart home trend but want to get your feet wet The New Echo Dot isn't such a heavy investment. Coming in around $50, this lets you experiment and get a taste of what everyone is talking about without breaking the bank.===================================================================================================So what comes inside the box?=======================(1x) Echo Dot (2nd Gen)(1x) 9-watt Power Adapter(1x) Micro USB cable(1x) Quick Start Guide* 3.5 mm aux cable sold separately*==========================================The Design===========================This smart home automation device resembles the dimensions of a well-dressed hockey puck. It has four buttons on it's halo-like top as well as seven microphones underneath the hood. There's a pair of buttons to increase and decrease the volume. Next you have the mute button than finally the action button for pairing the Dot to your WI-FI and/or Bluetooth devices. The speaker introduced with this model isn't too bad and deserves a bit of respect in terms of providing a decent sound for a Bluetooth transmitter, that being said there is always room for improvement. There is an illuminated edge that follows along the circular rim and lights up when alexa is speaking and called to action. The siding has a glossy finish with the USB connection and 3.5 mm aux port embedded on back to manually connect to speakers sporting the same connector. Beneath the device lies a rubber-like pad to add grip to keep it stationary on most surfaces. On the top and bottom you'll find tiny symmetrical holes for the mic's receivers to pick up on your voice as well as to help with distributing the output evenly.==========================================================================================================Functionality=========Alexa can do multiple things from controlling your thermostat, to ordering you an uber, and even playing jeopardy and solving math problems. She was mainly created to be an assistant in many fashions and is continually being integrated into appliances. I personally use the Dot for listening to music on my Bluetooth speaker, updates on weather forecasts, amazon shopping and package tracking, using Wikipedia, searching movie times and a personal reading assistant for my audible books but the list is growing seeing as she learns new skills every month and all you have to do is enable them through the Alexa app. I don't have any smart home toys to control but from my research she works more efficiently than any of the competitors (cough)(cough) Google Home.P.S. - Her jokes are corny...====================================================My Opinion-----------------This is a great opportunity for tech enthusiast and skeptics alike, as well as soccer moms and busy dads to dabble in the likes of smart home assistants. I find that the more I go through the learning curve with the Dot the more I see a practical use for it but don't get me wrong, artificial intelligence still gives me goose bumps and it's hard to get the terminator's skynet out of my brain. So I keep mine unplugged when not in use. Now, while the speaker is impressive for the quality in such a small package it will still tempt you to connect it to a more vibrant sound source so get a good speaker to pair it with.All in all,  it's not a finished product but it is the best option out there at the moment even more so for newbies and curious hopefuls treading into AI device land in terms of quality and tender. Try it out and who knows you might even find it useful.My verdict, it's worth it!Axiom Brevity==========[...] You can also check out all my other reviews on You Tube @ Axiom Brevity.Thank you for your time.",0.736842105263158,"positive"

5,"ERICA ARRIAGA","February 1, 2017","To give it five stars it truly must be powerful. I finally caved in and decided to get an Echo Dot to take my home automation a step further. First off the price is great. very reasonable and easily cost effective to add more. now I have mine in my bedroom and it works flawlessly. the app is easily to connect to. (I have an iPhone)  and connecting my Nest (smart thermostat) and philips hue was a breeze, along with my wemo switches. My absolute favorite is having IFTTT (if this then that) application installed. Every night I say ""Alexia trigger bedtime"" and like magic all the nights in my room turn off. Since my room is so close to the kitchen i often step over to set a timer or alarm and when my lights start flashing through the house i know my timer is off. Let me tell ya, this alone has saved a few dozen cookies from burning 😉.  I'm fine with the loudness of the speaker as back noise to whatever I'm doing and setting up Pandora and I heart radio is a breeze. Also connecting a Bluetooth speaker is super easy and works like a charm.I often have Alexia set alarms, turn on and off the lights, news brief .  I trigger (using IFTTT) bedtime, partymode(makes the hue lights change colors in a rainbow fashion), oh and try alexia trigger self destruct 😂I really enjoy my Echo Dot and i definitely see myself buying the larger one plus another Dot in the future. I hope over time it continues to improve and get smarter 😊",0.869565217391304,"positive"
5,"Forrest","December 25, 2016","Just recieved my Echo Dot a few days ago as a graduation gift and it has been truly life changing! This is the all-in-one solution I have been looking for my old Sony G Box. Prior to this I was using Chromecast audio and a Bluetooth adapter that fit on top of the iPod dock using the old apple standard so I would have to constantly walk up to the box and switch between Bluetooth and castiing which took up a lot of time. The reason I did this was because I like to stream from multiple music services like Apple Music and Spotify but you could only listen over wifi with Spotify because Apple Music doesn't support it.Echo Dot has Bluetooth built in so I can seamlessly switch to services (like Apple Music) that don't support wifi streaming with just a simple voice command!Speaking of voice commands so far Alexa has been able to understand me most of the time and it's been really convient. You do have to give up some privacy with the voice commands but there is a switch on the device to turn the mic off which is nice.My only issue is not with the device itself but with the Alexa app. Amazon needs more developers to work on it to make it more intuitive and faster. Right now the app feels clunky and slow. If Amazon can fix this issue than it will be perfect. I'm still giving a five star rating because the device is just so good.",0.764705882352941,"positive"
5,"JMDK","December 30, 2016","The Good:  The Echo Dots have great sound and lots of useful features.  You can ask them to play music from a number of sources such as Amazon Prime Music, iHeart Radio, Pandora, etc...  Using skills in the Alexa App (available for iOS and Android), you can interface with WiFi outlets, light switches, thermostats, etc...  Alexa can set up timers or alarms and give you weather updates, sports updates, even order a pizza (if you set up the skill).  If you have multiple Echos, they coordinate to know which one you're talking to.  You can even change the wake-up word (choice of ""Alexa"", ""Amazon"" or ""Echo"").The Bad:  The voice recognition works well if your first language is English, although it has some issues with people speaking with thicker accents.Overall:  We liked these enough that we ended up getting a number of these for different rooms with one as a Christmas present.  It would be nice to have voice profiles to make sure that an underage child doesn't order a bunch of stuff.  It would also be nice if Amazon had a native scripting language to program custom Alexa commands and save the scripts to the user's account.  I can only hope it's an upcoming feature.",0.785714285714286,"positive"

Fast forward a few hours I knew we needed a second one so I swooped one up at Fred Meyers and the kids are having a blast playing music and asking questions. Thanks amazon for another great product! Keep em coming! We are long time customers with several kindles and kindle fires. You never fail us! And thanks for making music unlimited affordable on the echo!

5,"R. Shuck","November 4, 2016","It's an echo device, so it's pretty good. The full sized echo has a better speaker. This seems to respond well, and if by chance your other Echo products ""hear"" you say something, it looks like Amazon created a method that will only allow one device to respond/comply. For instance, if I say Alexa, the dot or the Echo will light up the ring, and one of them will turn off. It may select by the quality of your voice input as detected by the microphones, but either way, it won't double-add stuff to your shopping list or anything like that. It also seems to know now what the Echo commercials sound like, so if someone on TV calls it out, your echo will light the ring and then go right back off.I have found the Echo's achilles heel though: white noise. A white noise source like a nature sound machine/app/dream machine can make it very difficult for the Echo to hear you, even if it's streaming that sound via bluetooth. I don't know if there's a fix or workaround, but be prepared.",0.75,"positive"
3,"Kainesmith.ky","December 30, 2016","I really like the echo dot so far. It has a few issues though which I will outline below.She tends to speak when not spoken to.  I am a 30 year old male that lives alone and it makes me jump every time but because I'm a big brave man I fight through the fear. Jokes aside though, if it were an older person who lives alone I could really see that being a problem. I'll be sitting watching tv and she will ask me to repeat my question or state a random answer to a question that I did not ask, maybe she picks up the tv I'm not sure.If there is any other noise what so ever she doesn't pick up the wake up word, so be prepared to mute the tv, tell everyone to be quiet and then say Alexa, or in my case echo. I have had to say echo releatedly a few times.Some good about it is the surprisingly good sound of the speaker when it's playing music. It is much better than I expected after reading some of the reviews.I like the ""to do list"" and ""shopping list"" feature which I add to the lists in the app for more clarity then have her read them back to me every morning. I also like asking for world news every morning when I first get up.It looks neat also and over all for the price I think it is worth it even if it only played music upon command from across the room. I can see myself using her for that the most.",0.733333333333333,"positive"

5,"Amritanshu Kar","January 27, 2017","Its not everyday you come across a product that serves numerous functions for its price. I got it as an open box condition for $40, did not want to pay the full $50 since I knew it sells for $40 during the black friday and prime day sale. Its been worth the penny since then. The most important features that hold me ontu this are the most basic ones.1. The early morning wakeup alarm and the ability to just tell it to stop.2. The ability to task the time without looking at your phone.3. The ability to do currency conversions.4. The ability to play prime music along with media controls..5. Ability to keep reminders on the fly.6. Perform calculations.7. Play news8. Trivia10. Smart Home functions.These are just the fraction of functions that I use. What makes it different from Siri, Cortana and Google Now is the fact that this has an unidirectional mike which makes it hear across the room. So even though it might not be as advanced as google now, it gets the basics right, which is the most important thing.

5,"H. Ramsey","January 2, 2017","This was a surprise Christmas gift and it turned out to be a very nice surprise! We had thought about purchasing it so the kids could ask it questions, but never seriously considered it. Then we received it gift.  Turns out it does a lot (a LOT) more than answer questions. The answering questions part is great, sometimes you have to rephrase it so Alexa understands what you are saying, but she does a good job answering 90% of the time.She easily recognizes our voices. Even my 4 year old can trigger it most of the time. When there is a lot of noise in the background she can add a word or two, but she seems to be learning as you go and we have not tried the voice training with her yet (there are 6 of us in the house so a lot of background noise). The key seems to be learning how to say what you are asking. If you want a song then use the word ""play"" first, if you have a question then use the question word first, etc.She does so much more than just answer questions. I love the news updates. I don't need to check my phone for top stories only to get distracted by the random junk that pops up with the news. You can choose the news channel (I saw BBC, NPR, CNN, Fox, and more offered). At the end of the top stories (goes about 5 minutes) she gives a weather update and forecast for your area. The update changes every hour so if you feel the need to get more news than go for it. Ask her if it is going to rain in the next hour, what the traffic is like for your commute, and more.Playing whatever song/artist/station you want is a great way to listen to music. Want to hear a song - just ask.The timer is useful. I used to grab my phone when I needed to set a timer, now I just ask Alexa. When the kids ask for tablet time or they need to do homework/reading time I can just ask Alexa to set the timer for me. This saves me going to my own tablet or phone (which I usually forget to do) and means the kids really get 15 minutes tablet time when I say they can rather than 45 minutes when I realize I forgot to set the timer.She has so many skills that we have yet to try, but the ones we have are fun additions. There is a great game, magic door, that works like a choose your own adventure (complete with sound effects). The kids are currently in the middle of trying to find a wizard. You can pause the game and re-enter at any time. Alexa guesses what animal (or thing) you are thinking when you play 20 questions or the animal game. There is a bedtime story skill where she tells a random bedtime story using your child's name. After telling my 4 year old a princess story last night (using her name) she said ""now it is time for bed and no you can't have another glass of water"". My daughter thought it was hilarious. It would be great for an elderly or bed-ridden person looking for something to talk to. It will also read audiobooks.The kids love the joke feature (Alexa tell me a joke) and my husband likes trying to trip her up with random odd questions (What is the meaning of life, who's your daddy, who let the dogs out, etc). Ask her what her resolutions are or the highlights of the year. It is good for a laugh.I haven't hooked her up to our thermostat yet and we don't have any smart lights/locks so I can't comment on that feature. I am seriously considering moving all my calendar stuff to google so she can plan my day for me. We put a code on ordering so the kids don't accidentally buy something (you can turn the feature off completely if you would rather), but you can still add things to lists when you think about them (then access that list in your amazon account).Overall, great! I would even consider getting a few more (you could use it as an alarm clock plus extra features in a bedroom, to control things in your living room, this one is in our kitchen for lists/timers/etc).",0.758620689655172,"positive"

She (Alexa) does so much and her response to some of the odd questions that I ask her is quite funny! :-) I told my grandfather how much I enjoyed it and he ordered the original full-sized one. The sound quality between the two is a big difference but from my understanding, they both do the exact same thing. If I had a choice between the larger Echo or the Echo Dot I would most likely go with the larger/original version because the sound quality is phenomenal!

1,"william","February 14, 2017","NEEDS security! Anyone in range of this things Bluetooth can connect and start playing music or speaking through this thing on cell calls. First few times I started hearing random voices in my living room, I was a bit weirded out, because I had no idea where they were coming from. Then one day, I heard Alexa announce that a bluetooth device had connected, so I opened the app and discovered numerous devices, that weren't mine. After kicking them all off, I attempted to find some kind of security protocol to keep out unwanted connections, but soon discovered that there wasn't any. Now, I get to randomly hear other voices or music start playing, in the middle of the night, anytime the people in the apartments behind me decide they wanna screw around.Other than that, the thing's works pretty well. Some of the functionality, like the particular nature of commands, takes a little getting used to, but about 99% of the time, it understands perfectly.Until amazon decides to add, what should've been a no-brainer, security feature, I cannot give this thing a good rating. The fact that anyone can be woken up in the middle of the night, by a random person connecting to their device, is ridiculous. Fix it.",0.625,"positive"
2,"Thomas Barnes","January 31, 2017","Received an Echo Dot as a gift. The device itself works well, although I do wish there were more useful skills - there seems to be an infinite number of skills like fart sounds that have no use beyond juvenile humor. The real problem, however, is the smartphone app that is needed. On an Android phone with a solid 4G or high-speed WiFi connection, the app very frequently hangs on the start screen with the progress indicator turning but never initializes. It's nice to be able to update a shopping list by voice, but the poor app makes this an effectively useless feature when you can't access the list via the app when out shopping. The device appears to be well designed, but the app is a good example of lousy software engineering - no doubt done on the cheap. This makes the Echo Dot an interesting toy, but not reliable enough to be really useful.",0.681818181818182,"positive"
5,"Andrew","March 26, 2017","This was my first Echo purchase and I am overall very pleased with it's performance. Initially, I was worried that it was going to be a Siri knockoff with only a limited number of voice commands and functions with constant errors; however, I have not received single error response since I have owned it. I am an Amazon Prime member and from the time I clicked confirm purchase to the time it was delivered to my doorstep only took 3 days, and best part of all, shipping was free.I currently have mine sitting by my bed and have synced it with the app, available on for all phone types, which allows me to carry out a number of voice commands including: ""Alexa, set an alarm for..., check the weather, play Pandora, or tell me a joke."" The app interface is a little clunky at times, but you're able to see the history of recent requests, and Alexa is constantly learning and adapting to your specific commands and style.If you are looking to buy an Echo Dot because you want a cheap introduction into Bluetooth connectivity with household lights, televisions, gaming systems, thermostats, or other Echo products then buy this Echo Dot. I am working with a grad student budget, and for $50 dollars this sleek and sexy ""command station"" was worth every penny. I did not receive any compensation for this review, I am writing it because I debated on buying one for about a week before pulling the trigger, and I just want to speed up the process for people like me who may be waffling...trust me, its completely worth the $50.",0.5,"netural"

I don't have a 'connected home' and my entertainment system is on Google Player / Chromecast so it won't integrate with the Echo.

And for the next several hours I'm entertained.Note to anyone in the digital advertising world: Echo uses Bing search and provides local results based on Yelp. All answers are also sent to the app on the smartphone paired to the Echo device. Geez, Bing? Yelp? Oh well, Echo can answer most questions...Four years ago I was given a very good Vizio accessory speaker that worked with the iPad version 2. That iPad tanked last year and the newer Apple products don't use the larger USB connector so I thought the speaker was trash. Using the mini-pin output from Echo to the speaker I now have enough sound to fill the first floor of our house and reclaimed a speaker that would have been tossed to the curb. One advantage of the corded speaker connection - I don't have to re-do pairing ever, a common occurrence with any of my Bluetooth speakers.I am looking for a white-light set of wi-fi enabled bulbs (boring, but useful) as a first step toward home automation.I really want an Echo solution that can manage our TV with Hulu / Amazon / Netflix / Sling / YouTube. (Google Play would be a huge bonus. Because competitors). If I could replace the massive (and to some confusing) Harmony TV remote with voice commands life would be good. I can't find anyone who says they have successfully managed this set of tasks. Yes, the new Fire Stick is Alexa-enabled, but I'd prefer one listening device rather than two.I considered the Google product and chose the Amazon Echo instead. While Google may have better search capabilities, I'm pretty well covered between phone and computers. I saw the Echo Dot as a low-cost entry point where I could salvage a good sounding compact speaker system AND dip my toe into home automation without spending a fortune. Next year?

5,"Manders","December 15, 2016","I like the Dot quite a bit, but it could be better. I'm not sure if it is the ALEXA program that the Dot connects to or if it is the Bing Search engine, I will have to do some more testing. Some times it can't find info it should be able to. Playing Music works Great!!! The Built in speaker is OK. But if you connect it to a really good speaker with either an Audio Cable or Bluetooth it sounds Great!! I am having the Dot read a Kindle book to me. It works well but the inflections in the text to speech program need work. However that is not a limitation of the device but of current technology. Getting local weather or movies works well. Alexa can ""learn"" other ""Skills"" but you have to tell Alexa to use the skill. It would be better if these skills were available all the time, and didn't have to be ""turned on"". The Dot does not have a battery, so if you unplug it, it will need to search and connect to your WIFI again when you plug it back in. A great work around is to get a small battery pack (needs a least a 1 amp output port) and keep it plugged into the battery pack and then plug the battery pack into a wall charger. This allows the Dot to be truly portable. I had mine in my shirt pocket and was listening to a book while putting up Christmas lights outside for at least two hours.

She turns on and off all of our lights, our furnace, air conditioner, she even sets and changes the mood lights in our bedroom.  She is now my alarm clock, she plays music, and I used her a lot for new words as my talking dictionary.Remember the days where you have to turn on your computer and Google something?  Well, now you can ask Alexa even if you just woke up from your bed like as her ""Alexa, what time is it?""  You can even set an alarm for Alexa to wake you up in half an hour, or even play your favorite music.  I think what I like most about Alexa is that she has made my life that much easier especially when my hands are tied and I don't have a set of hands to turn on the lights, she can do that for me with a ""say a command!""

If Alexa is unable to answer a question, she should be able to perform an internet search, and come back with an answer.An example of the above will be: Alexa, how to care for Money tree Plants?I cannot find the answer to this question.Even though Alexa was unable to find the answer, I was hoping that she was giving the ability to search the world wide web, and come back with the answer,  not just saying that I cannot find the answer to this question.The Artificial intelligence market gadget is getting more competitive everyday, with Google and soon Apple entering the market, Alexa has a lot of catching up to do, and will need to keep up.",0.666666666666667,"positive"

I just received it yesterday, and because the setup was difficult, that would be my first criticism and the explanation for 4 instead of the perfect score.  It took me a couple of hours + an actual chat with a very helpful customer service representative at 8:30 on a weekend morning – a chat that got me setup in a very short period of time (fyi, the problem was that my factory reset was incomplete last night – I had not pressed for a full 20 seconds on the two reset keys, and that has to happen to let the blue light go out).  But now that the Echo Dot is connected and registered, I'm just scratching the surface of all the power of this cute little device.  It comes with this very tempting offer for Amazon Music Unlimited for $3.99 per month – there's a free 30 day trial period that I've signed up for and am spinning up some pretty decent music with simple voice commands as I write this.

Took it out to my shop which is about 45 feet from my router, I figured that since the Echo worked out there,  the Dot should also.  Since speakers are not one of the Dot's strong points, I hooked up my Bose Roommates, plugged them into the Dot, then plugged in the Dot.  Alexa sounds great with real speakers.  The setup was extremely easy, and since the Echo was connected to the internet, the Dot had no trouble connecting, didn't even ask for the router password, I figured it used the Echo's connection.  The first thing I asked the Dot to do was play some music, with the Bose speakers the sound was awesome, even when I turned the volume up.  This has to be one of the better purchases I've made, now I have music in my shop, as well as in my computer room, and am extremely please with the Dot, how easy it was to set up on the first try, and no doubt the first of a few more for the rest of the house.

5,"Patrick Glose","November 22, 2016","I'm sure there isn't much to say that has not already been said, but I did want to give koodo's to the developers of this device.  My home already has nice sound, the price of the echo was just not in my electronics budget at this time.  I was very excited when I found the Dot, and for the price, I had to give it a go.  I've only had it for about a week now, but we love it (her).  Many Easter eggs built in, and just asking her to play a song, a group, or genre and have her do it is delightful.  Right now, she's hooked up to my Denon through a 3.5mm jack, but the Denon doesn't offer bluetooth.  I'm working on adding a bluetooth HDMI adapter.  As for automation, I am a bit of a tinkerer when it comes to gadget and cool stuff, so I went on several hunts when Alexa arrived to our home.  From what I can tell, if you're looking to automate (lights, thermostat, etc), you will most likely need a hub.  At first, I thought I'd need several hubs to support different manufacturers devices.  Seemingly, not so.  The Samsung SmartThings hub ($50 on Amazon right now) not only has support for most device manufacturers, but also has (and the coolest part for me) open source platform (Amazon also has open source).  What this means is, like Android, anyone can develop ""skills"" (Amazons name for an app or program).  The market is going to flood with new skills and devices from people like me who love building tech.  So, like I said, there probably isn't much I can say about the Dot that hasn't been said, but there is much to be said for the Alexa environment.p.s., the microphones (7 of them) are amazing.  She can hear me from a good distance.",1,"positive"

Soooo, I bought the Oontz Angle 3 Plus Bluetooth speaker WHICH some reviews claim it not so great however, I can tell you that it absolutely made all the difference for my needs. I come home from work and ask Alexa to play whatever genre I am in the mood to listen to INSTEAD of turning my TV on AND, I will tell you that I LOVE to watch my flicks but somehow this little DOT forces me to out my head into a place of less ""noise"". I choose to filter what is more important to me as, you should. Is the DOT perfect? is Alexa perfect? No, I ask Alexa questions like, ""when were humans first created?"", she cannot respond but ask her what the SUN is made up of or if there is a chance that life on MARS is possible and she will give you an answer. When you wake up, you can say, ""Alexa, Good Morning and she will respond. On April 1st, Fools Day, I said, ""Alexa, Goodnight"" and her response was, ""Good night and don't forget to fool someone before the day is over"", pretty smart technology. Do I plan on buying more, yes I do. Give it try but DO buy a separate portable speaker for an enhanced experience.",0.9,"positive"
3,"Georgia","April 3, 2017","I mean, it's great for asking about weather (temperature), sports, news, playing some music, setting timers and alarms, some calculations and conversions, and some of the skills are great, but it's just not very intuitive:1. When I ask about weather, it'll tell me the temperature and if it's sunny / rainy / whatever. If I say ""Weather in Celsius"" (I use Fahrenheit) or ""Humidity,"" it treats what I say like I just asked about the weather.2. ""Wake me up in 15 minutes"" makes it set a 15 minute timer instead of setting an alarm 15 minutes after I asked for an alarm to be set. Timers aren't as loud as alarms, so it's not a good thing to wake up with. It's a little nitpicky, but my phone can do it, so I've just been using my phone instead.3. Sometimes it's a little hard of hearing. I'll say ""Alexa, weather"" and it'll light up when I call her, but will just ignore whatever I say after. This has happened when I was a little farther away from it (around 3 feet, but with nothing else making noise in my room), and it has happened when I was less than a foot away from it (it's on my desk, and it sometimes can't hear me when I'm actually sitting on my desk).There's also sometimes a disconnect with regards to how she thinks I talk, which is weird since I don't really have any distinct accent, so I sometimes have to try out different pronunciations to see what she understands, and those don't work all the time either. It's a frustration of mine if I want her to play something from Spotify, but names in general are weird so I'll let that slide4. Sometimes I'll ask something, then I'll ask a follow-up question right after it and she just doesn't connect the dots:""Who played Belle in the Beauty and the Beast Movie?""""In Beauty and the Beast, Belle was played by Emma Watson""""What are her other movies""""Hmm, I can't find an answer to the question I've heard""""What are Emma Watson's other movies""""Here are a few movies playing near you today...""??????Also:""Play Art Angels on Spotify""""Playing Art Angels by Grimes on Spotify""""Play more songs by Grimes / Play similar songs""""Artangels by Grimes""""Play a different album""""Sorry, I didn't get that"" (I've said it different ways and she still gives me this answer.""Play a different album by this artist""""Here's an album you might like: The Black Parade by My Chemical Romance""??????It's a little frustrating, but at least I know what I can and can't ask her. I'd probably still buy this regardless since I extensively use some of her features and she's still pretty convenient to use when I'm too lazy to fumble through my phone and look at the weather report for the day or the week / set a timer (for tea / ramen) / get scores for sports so I can basically sympathize / celebrate with the people in my life who watch sports / make to-do lists as i think about it / play music / listen to audiobooks.",0.52,"positive"
5,"H. Salsano","March 9, 2017","This was our first Echo Dot, and we love her.  Although, not sure she always loves us, as sometimes she doesn't even answer us.  She seems to have a hearing deficiency.  We do have to speak loud and clear for her to even hear us, and especially if we want her to actually understand us.  The problem is mostly when she is playing music or the TV is on.  Of course, she can hear everyone on the TV just fine and respond to all the Alexa commercials.  Good think I have the purchasing PIN set up so only I can order things!I like listening to the news feeds from Cnet, NPR and the weather.  I like controlling the TV, AV system and lights through her.  I add items to the Our Groceries android app through her, and she usually gets it right.  I use the timer and alarm functions often, especially when my 2 other kitchen timers are already running for other things.  I can tell her to ""Turn on Amazon Music"" which turns on the stereo and selects Aux, turns on the Amazon Basics Bluetooth receiver, and then I tell her what to play and it comes through the stereo.  I can even listen to kindle books and such this way for more volume.  Love the pause and resume, in case the phone rings.  For music, I tell her to Skip this song when something awful come on .As time goes on, I find more useful things.  I am now looking at a new skill to alert friends if there is an emergency, called Ask My Buddy, which sounds useful for when one of us is home alone and something happens.",0.666666666666667,"positive"
5,"A. Hewitt","January 28, 2017","This device has lots of potential but we're still beginners, using it as a replacement for a radio, CD player, alarm clock and timer. The Echo Dot has performed as expected. In the bedroom, it's paired with a TDK A33 Bluetooth speaker and it's good enough for music listening, amazingly good for the size of the speaker. In the living room, I wanted better sound (think Saint-Saens Organ Symphony) so I got out my hand-truck and moved some old B&W loudspeakers into the dining area. With an Esinkin Bluetooth receiver Esinkin Bluetooth Receiver, Bluetooth Audio Adapter (NFC Enabled) for Stereo Sound System with Long Range and Acoustics and an old Topping TP32 amplifier, it worked! But the TP32 runs off a 12V supply, so it's 24V rail-to-rail, 8V RMS. An efficient 4-ohm speaker would be OK but the B&Ws are 8-ohms so the maximum power is 5 watts - talk about background music. I changed over to an old JVC stereo amplifier and all was well. At least until CINCHOUSE (Commander-in-Chief House a.k.a. She Who Must Be Obeyed) walked in and said: ""Those speakers are TOO BIG. They have to go"". So I got out my hand-truck ... After I had decluttered the dining area I devised a Plan B. The TV has a headphone jack which is connected to a pair of Mackie MR5 speakers Pair of Mackie MR mk3 Series MR5mk3 5-Inch 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors (which I think sound better than any soundbar at the price) and they are always powered on so if I could mix the TV and Echo signals I could hear either (or both at once). I bought a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer, connected the TV and Bluetooth receiver to it, hooked the output to the Mackies and - voila! - beautiful music from the Echo. By damn, ain't technology grand!Update: I had been reluctant to put the Echo close to the TV because I expected the sound from the speakers to interfere with the voice commands but I now have it sitting just behind the TV, level with the TV feet. The Echo understands me as well as ever and I'm able to hardwire it into the mixer. The sound is improved over Bluetooth. It sounds better all over the room and if I stand in front of the speakers the stereo imaging is amazingly precise.",0.789473684210526,"positive"
5,"GLS","April 10, 2017","Well I was really pissed at Amazon because they dropped the ball on hitting their two day Prime delivery (because they've gone to “shipping partners” who don't care). I'd ordered this Echo Dot for a friend who can't see, and wanted to help him manage his Pandora music using voice commands. It arrived this afternoon, I hooked it up to my own Pandora account and I'm thunderstruck. What an absolutely beautiful integration of speech input and a great adaptive online music app. As I write this I'm listening to a Pandora station I defined a couple of years ago, “Chigago Radio” named for that great group, Chicago. The music is streaming through the little speaker built into the Dot (it really isn't all that bad in terms of fidelity, though for regular listening I'll normally patch it into my hi-fi system) and as I write and let my station wash over me, I occasionally pause and say “Alexa, thumbs up” or “Alexa, thumbs down” to steer Pandora's adaptive programming in the right direction. She responds “sure...rating saved”. What's amazing is that I know I haven't provided this much input since I created the station two years ago as I have over the past twenty minutes. This has been totally effortless, as the Alexa and Pandora apps are joined at the hip online – I don't even know where my smart TV or Roku remotes are at the moment, I just speak and it happens. Wow! I can't even imagine how my blind friend (a former musician) is going to feel about being able to do this. I just ordered a Dot for myself, because it's that cool. Amazon, you are totally forgiven for the late delivery; you've hit a grand slam with this device! And Alexa, I would love to speak to you privately. You have won my heart, honey ;-) Whew....",0.888888888888889,"positive"
5,"Kathy","November 13, 2016","I bought an Echo last week and loved it so much that I had to have a Dot for our bedroom.  The first thing that impressed me was the quality of the sound. I had planned on using an external speaker with it, but there is no need for it at all. I'm able to have the sounds nice and low when I'm listening in bed and can turn it up and hear it all the way in my bathroom which is approx. 16 feet away.  The sound is great.  It's not the rich sound that is with the Echo, but it's definitely very good. I used the same app that I had downloaded when I set up my Echo to set up my Dot and it couldn't have been easier. I just plugged it in, connected it to our wifi and then continued with the set up on my app. I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes.As with the Echo, my favorite things to use the Dot for are listening to music and having it read my Kindle books to me.  I love Audible, but don't always purchase audio books, so it's so nice to just say ""Alexa read (whichever book I'm reading)"" After I tell it to read my book, I say ""set sleep timer for 15 minutes"" and it will shut right off. Last night I had trouble falling asleep and I asked it to play music to help me sleep and I heard a selection of relaxing nature sounds.  Then, in the morning I can have it turn on an AM station I like, so I can listen to that while I'm getting ready for the day. I know I can do all of these things on my cell phone, but it's so nice to just be in the middle of whatever I'm doing and just say outloud what I want to hear without having to pick something up.I'm sure I'll find other uses that I like for the Dot, but for now I'm just thrilled to have it read to me or play music. And I can't emphasize enough how good the sound quality is. If you are thinking about buying a speaker to go with it, I'd wait to get it home and make sure you really need one. Unless you are using this in a very big room, chances are you won't.",0.904761904761905,"positive"
5,"Gadgeteer","January 10, 2017","This is an amazing little device at a very affordable price. The setup was very straight forward. I had it up and running in a matter of a few minutes. It just needed to connect to my wireless network and away it went. I also found that Alexa can control Insteon and Phillips Hue lighting. So I've added the Insteon Skill to Alexa through the Alexa iPad app and I now have voice control over my home lighting and furnace. There are so many skills you can add to Alexa and new ones show up on a daily basis. Alexa can also control the Next (and other) smart furnace thermostats by adding the ""Nest"" skill. I can change the thermostat from anywhere in the house I have an Echo Dot in voice range. So setting my thermostat now is a simple voice command ""Alexa. Set Nest to 70 degrees."" and she says OK and does it.  It can also pair with most any Bluetooth speakers. So I have the Echo dot streaming radio stations to a Bluetooth speaker. Controlling the volume is a simple as ""Alexa. Turn it down."" or ""Alexa. Turn it off."" Super cool!I really don't think most people understand how powerful and easy to use this device is. You can ask it anything you might search for on the Internet using Google or Bing. You can also set up an alarm clock function to wake you. The only word of caution is to be sure to set up a security code in the Alexa app when ordering anything off the Internet. Otherwise, anyone within voice range can order anything on the Internet without having to provide a security code.",0.888888888888889,"positive"
5,"Gary","March 26, 2017","I can't believe I ever lived without these.  I put one in my Media Room and one in my Master Bath.  In addition to the incredible music access, and all the instant information access, the Echo Dot links both to my Samsung SmartThings and Logitech Harmony Ultimate systems.  So using Alexa, I can control my lights, my ceiling fans, and my entire media center.  Relative to music access, I have found that the free access Amazon music didn't include some of the music I liked.  So I upgraded to the Amazon Unlimited Music service for just one Echo Dot ($3.99/month).  If you want that access on multiple Echo Dots, the Unlimited Music service is $7.99/month. One limitation I have noticed: bluetooth connectivity is problematic.  The Echo Dot will nicely be playing music through my a/v receiver's bluetooth, and will suddenly lose the connection.  In addition, every time you use the Echo, you have to tell the Echo to connect to bluetooth.  I am able to connect both my Dots to my a/v receiver, and my stand-alone  bathroom speaker using a 3.5mm - RCA plug and a 3.5mm - 3.5mm cable respectively.  The hard-wire connection is a lot more reliable. The Echo Dot's internal speaker is fine for non-music use, but is pretty limited for music.  With only two limitations, I can't think of a better electronic toy!  Buy it, you'll love it!",0.75,"positive"

So when Amazon had their $9 bigthanks sale, I couldn't say no for only $41..If you're just getting started, or are thinking about starting, and don't want to spend a fortune on smart bulbs and wall sockets, if you're a little tech savvy,  the Rf remote light bulb sockets cost about $20 for 3, and Rf remote wall sockets cost $30 for 5. Then what you need is a ""broadlink rm pro 2,or rm2"" which isn't more than $40 depending on where you buy.. Then do some googling ""Amazon broadlink rm2"" and you'll see how to control anything ir and Rf controlled using on off commands. Which isn't full blown smart bulbs, but it's great for saving money when dimming and changing colors isn't needed..My only problem so far is you can't use ""and""  commands, like Google home can. For example, ""alexa, turn on kitchen AND living room lights"" won't work. You have to say ""alexa, living room lights.. Alexa, kitchen lights."" which annoys the crap out of me and everyone listening.But overall, I'm controlling 3 bulbs, 5 wall sockets, and my TV and Xbox, for less than the cost of the big echo, which imho is pretty cool.

5,"K. Ortega","April 2, 2017","I'm in love with Dot.  I got this instead of the large system for two reasons, first because I have a Bose portable speaker and because I didn't know how often I'd use Alexa. Now I'm either going to buy another Dot for my bedroom or fork out the money for the full sized Echo.  The reason for that is my Bose speaker sleeps, so if I ask Alexa a question I don't always hear the answer. I either end up disconnecting Dot from the speaker or have to wake my speaker. Not always convenient. Alexa has been fun and we all love her.  No having to teach her to recognize our voices. She works out of the box once connected to the wifi. She's revolutionized my shopping lists alone. Instead of writing it down or punching it into my phone, I simply ask her to add something to my list and it then shows up in the Alexa app on my phone. Now my kids tell her what to add and we're all on point. I've connected my calendar to her and she tells me what's going on. I love the news briefs and we play jeopardy every day.  I can't wait to utilize her other features, but we're off to a good start.The sound on the Dot isn't perfect for a full time music speaker but if you're in a small space it's not bad. If you want better quality opt for the full sized. But this is budget friendly and perfect to move from room to room.",0.866666666666667,"positive"
2,"AReview4U","October 26, 2016","UPDATE TO REVIEW BELOW:  I have 3 of these set up in my house.  I've already had to exchange one because it quit working.  Now 2 of the other 3 all of a sudden can NEVER hear you - you have to yell at it, whereas before they all worked just fine.  ALSO, I ask/tell it to do something, like turn off a light, and it gives me an answer that is totally unrelated to anything even close to the words I've said.  I'm beginning to think maybe I should try that other one of these things that are out there by another company because these are not holding up.  ALSO, out of the blue I am simply sitting on my couch BY MYSELF surfing the net, and all of a sudden she starts talking for no reason whatsoever.  I do not have the tv on; I'm not talking to myself; so WTF!  I'm becoming less and less enamored with this product, and I've bought about 10 of them - 3 for myself, 2 for my boyfriend and the others I've given out for gifts or plan to (Christmas is almost here).  I normally don't rag on something on here BUT I've bought enough of these that they better not all start messing up, like 2 of my 3 are already doing.  Who wants to have to yell at something for it to respond - AND OH, just so you know, I'm standing with 6' of it - I'm not 50' away.  RIGHT NEXT TO IT and I get NOTHING.  Then I yell, and all of a sudden the stupid thing responds.  Did I mention I was ANNOYED!!!I received my Echos timely and packaged well.  I am in LOVE with this little thing.  It works perfectly for me so far.  I have had a time or 2 when it simply would spin and not respond, but not enough to cause me to want to return it. I have one in my living room and one in my bedroom.  While it does reach out, for me, I don't want to have to yell to it from a distance.  Also, it connected to my Samsung bluetooth soundbar instantly (even though my speaker is not on the ""approved"" list you see here on Amazon).  It has come in so handy numerous times, like asking a quick question I have without having to pull out the tablet or phone to look it up; I have intergrated my google calendar so it will tell me what's on the schedule for the day or week.  I have also integrated the music from my Samsung S7 and it plays all my music as soon as I ask it to.  I have it hooked up to my Hue lights, and it works great from Alexa's standpoint - the Hue lights are a hit or miss as they often keep losing the connection to the bridge - even with the light in the same room as the router.  If this doesn't stop, they'll be going back because at $200 for my Hue kit, these things should not keep losing a connection and becoming undiscoverable - BUT, that has nothing to do with the Alexa.  If you don't have one of these, I highly recommend it.  It is handy as can be and ONLY $49.  What a dream gadget.  MY ONE SUGGESTION IS THIS THOUGH.  IT IS AN AMAZON DEVICE SO WHY DOESN'T IT HAVE A SKILL TO TURN ON OUR AMAZON FIRESTICK!!!",0.814814814814815,"positive"

Each DOT is used on a different floor of my home. The DOT in my bedroom is connected to a speaker by WIFI also connected to that DOT is a smart plug that controls a lamp. The DOT in my living area is connected using a cable to a speaker. I intend to have smart thermostats installed and connected too. I enjoy the music selection available using DOT. And,  I enjoy the convenience of weather reports, news, time, alarms, etc.My beef is that sometimes DOT does not work using the voice mode. I can usually get what I want by going into my ALEXA APP and making a manual request. This happens most often at night when I want to have my lamp turned off or my music turned on. I am not sure why this happens. Generally, in the morning when I try the same request that failed at night, it works. When these failures occur, I check to make sure WiFi is working and it always is. ALEXA also lights up indicating that she hears me but does not execute the request. I am starting to wonder if I have made a mistake by buying the expensive Smart thermostats.If anyone has any tips on how to get DOT to be more consistent, please share.",0.736842105263158,"positive"

Well, we now own an Echo, a Tap and two Dots. They are all great.Myth 1.  You do NOT need Echo to use a Dot. Dot is autonomous. It responds to Alexa commands just like Echo, and can control remote devices just as well.Myth 2. You MUST have external speakers. Not so. The speaker in Dot is no great shakes, but it works. The audio output to a good set of powered speakers is great.Myth 3. If you use Echo, or Dot or Tap, you cannot have two or more doing different things. Not so. I can have Alexa via Echo playing Clapton in the living room and have Alexa via Dot playing the Dead in the bedroom, at the same time, with just one Amazon Prime account, not even the Prime Music account.Other:  Both Dot and Echo have to be plugged into 115 v all the time to work. The Tap is rechargeable and bluetooth so it is portable. Great feature. We use Echo and Dot to control TP-Link smart plugs and smart switches. They work great. (I love the TP-Link stuff, maybe another review. But Alexa at my house can control the smart stuff at our beach place 250 miles away. In fact you have to be precise in your language with Alexa or she'll be turning stuff on and off in the other location...)I actually haven't tried the Tap yet with remotes (it's at the beach and I'm not), but I assume it will work just as well. The only caveat is that you have to 'enable remote' on the smart plugs, etc. in order to have Alexa turn them on and off. Some folks are leery about doing that. If I get hacked and some clown wants to turn off my bedroom light, so be it.

Amazon has built a lot of fun responses, as well as a lot of useful ones (Alexa, Weather; Alexa, Traffic; Alexa, Set Alarm; Alexa, Start Timer).  You can enable ""SKILLS"" to add a lot of functions and connectivity with other devices.Alexa does not understand grammar.  It is strictly listening for sounds it has been programmed to recognize, there is no real A.I. behind this.  But you can speak some requests in a variety of different ways.  It's fun to pretend Alexa has artificial intelligence and try to talk to it.  But this is not ""Watson"", it is not recognizing grammar or thinking in any way.  It's just recognizing sounds and checking them against a list of predefined responses and actions.A note on PRIVACY:  The device is always listening for the sound ""ALEXA"" - listening but NOT sending audio to the cloud.  Once it hears ""ALEXA"" it begins recording and sending that recorded audio to the Amazon cloud computers for voice recognition.  Those recordings and the commands they trigger are stored on your Amazon account, not unlike how cell phones used to store a log of every text you sent.

ALSO, I ask/tell it to do something, like turn off a light, and it gives me an answer that is totally unrelated to anything even close to the words I've said.  I'm beginning to think maybe I should try that other one of these things that are out there by another company because these are not holding up.  ALSO, out of the blue I am simply sitting on my couch BY MYSELF surfing the net, and all of a sudden she starts talking for no reason whatsoever.  I do not have the tv on; I'm not talking to myself; so WTF!  I'm becoming less and less enamored with this product, and I've bought about 10 of them - 3 for myself, 2 for my boyfriend and the others I've given out for gifts or plan to (Christmas is almost here).  I normally don't rag on something on here BUT I've bought enough of these that they better not all start messing up, like 2 of my 3 are already doing.  Who wants to have to yell at something for it to respond - AND OH, just so you know, I'm standing with 6' of it - I'm not 50' away.  RIGHT NEXT TO IT and I get NOTHING.  Then I yell, and all of a sudden the stupid thing responds.  Did I mention I was ANNOYED!!!I received my Echos timely and packaged well.  I am in LOVE with this little thing.  It works perfectly for me so far.  I have had a time or 2 when it simply would spin and not respond, but not enough to cause me to want to return it. I have one in my living room and one in my bedroom.  While it does reach out, for me, I don't want to have to yell to it from a distance.  Also, it connected to my Samsung bluetooth soundbar instantly (even though my speaker is not on the ""approved"" list you see here on Amazon).  It has come in so handy numerous times, like asking a quick question I have without having to pull out the tablet or phone to look it up; I have intergrated my google calendar so it will tell me what's on the schedule for the day or week.  I have also integrated the music from my Samsung S7 and it plays all my music as soon as I ask it to.  I have it hooked up to my Hue lights, and it works great from Alexa's standpoint - the Hue lights are a hit or miss as they often keep losing the connection to the bridge - even with the light in the same room as the router.  If this doesn't stop, they'll be going back because at $200 for my Hue kit, these things should not keep losing a connection and becoming undiscoverable - BUT, that has nothing to do with the Alexa.  If you don't have one of these, I highly recommend it.  It is handy as can be and ONLY $49.  What a dream gadget.  MY ONE SUGGESTION IS THIS THOUGH.  IT IS AN AMAZON DEVICE SO WHY DOESN'T IT HAVE A SKILL TO TURN ON OUR AMAZON FIRESTICK!!!",0.814814814814815,"positive"
5,"Ken","February 3, 2017","I haven't had a chance to play with ""Alexa"" that much.  I'll ask her what the time is just to keep her awake.  My wife thinks that is silly.  I'll ask her to Wikipedia technical items, and she is ready to tell me all.  I of course got her her own leather jacket, and so far have introduced her to the WiFi thermostat.  It was cold in the house this morning, so I asked her to set the THERMOSTAT to 69.  She did it, and that one degree made my morning.  Of course I had her set it back.  I was watching a documentary on Netflix, and one of the people in the show was named Alexi.  That was close enough for Alexa, even though said by the TV.I've added a Z wave hub and will add some 3-way WiFi switches, and be able to have Alexa turn lights on and off by voice command.  Someone needs to write a book on all the possible ways to do this.",0.5,"netural"

And when I started to get emails about what Alexa could do, I was informed I could reorder items through Alexa. What a joke! I have tried it numerous times to get her to reorder items but she says all the time that she can't find the items & has to put it to my shopping list. I tell her that it is on my Subscribe & Save & she still can't find it. As far as I can tell, she's really only good for playing music & telling me the weather. My kids ask her questions all the time & she can't give them good answers. The weird thing is she will start talking while we're having a meal. We don't say her name (which is the wake word) but she responds. Like another reviewer said, for a smart device, she isn't very smart.",0.714285714285714,"positive"
3,"Michele S.","March 17, 2017","It's very frustrating at times. For example, its awesome to be able to tell Alexa to set your alarm for 6 am. Some days you can tell it ""Alexa off"" to stop the alarm. Other days, you are screaming your lungs out and Alexa won't turn off no matter what you do, so you yank the thing out of the wall.  Hence, frustrating. It doesn't seem to understand as much as ""ok google"" on my phone. Alexa frequently says she doesn't understand. I hate also that it tries to get you to buy things--like extra music. No thanks. I also hated the fact that I bought it on ""special"" only to find that one week later it was on sale even cheaper.  But to send it back and re-purchase it would have cost nearly as much as the sale, so that sucked.  I think if it could do more, and understand more, I'd be happier with it.",0.3,"negative"

5,"Texas Jack","January 17, 2017","Great product!  It does everything as advertised and MORE.  I am now able to use Alexa voice commands for my X10 devices simply by adding two free programs called HEYU (to send X10 commands) and HA-bridge (this emulates a Phillips Hue bridge) on an old Raspberry Pi model B.  After installing and setting up these two programs, simply tell Alexa to ""Discover Devices"".  Alexa will find everything you configured in the  HA-bridge software.  You can tell Alexa to now turn ON, OFF, or DIM those devices, it communicates to the HA-bridge software which then tells the HEYU program to send the X10 command over the power lines via a X10 CM11A transceiver (or wireless if you have a firecracker device connected to the Raspberry Pi).

2,"Darkshadow","April 8, 2017","""Alexa, go *&!$ yourself"" is usually where I end up after a few minutes arguing with Alexa to perform some basic task I've asked her to do many MANY times before. This time, however, she doesn't under stand what ""living room lights"" are. She responded accurately to that request, ""That's not very nice!"" Since she can take and understand an insult, I feel comfortable anthropomorphize her, and will there for continue to refer to Alexa as a ""her"".Anecdotes aside, here is the quick and dirty on Alexa (Dot or Echo, as I own many of both).Alexa responds very well to commands. When she responds, she understands most commands the first time. ""When"" she responds, ""most commands"" and ""first time"" are the problems. Periodically she simply ignores me. Her little lights flicker, showing she hears me, yet the eventually dim as I speak, or a few seconds after I finish speaking. This happens in loud or pen-drop quite rooms. I don't know what causes it. I've tried resetting her, this works some times, but not all the time. I've tried sleeping on it, and she ends up working fine in the next day and for a while. I don't consider this acceptable. I've lights, thermostats, and other devices connected to her, I've abandoned remotes and the idea of finding switches on plugs, or the inconvenience of  getting out of bed to turn off the bedroom lights. I'm committed to this automation process; be it Alexa, Google, or whatever frustrates me the least.""Most commands"" is the next problem. Alexa can do a lot of things, but simply not enough things, and with less variety than we require. Devices and software works well when we know what we must do to get it to respond the way we want. While I'm impressed with the variety of ways I can tell Alexa change the volume on her music, ask her some basic question, or tell her to go #$!@ herself, I'm still more than disappointed with the simple stuff that requires -I- learn her commands, rather than her know mine. Friends and family must be instructed on many of the commands, and I dislike having to keep a cheat sheet on how to turn on my kitchen lights.She does respond correctly MOST of the time, the ""first time"", however, if I forget which sentences work or what something is called, she simply doesn't have a clue. I don't expect perfection, and in the regard she does hit the mark more than miss, but, well, just look up that video of the kid asking to play a game with her and getting a list of pornographic positions... I've not experienced that harsh a misunderstanding, but enough to make you giggle... but only the first time.The devices Alexa can control is a VERY short list; this is one of the biggest reasons to avoid getting one of these novelties. It's novel to turn on and off lights (though expensive for an entire house), it's nice that I can play music (though only that which I have on Amazon Music), and control the thermostat (though, as I write this, to the command, ""Alexa, set thermostat to 74"", I get ""Sorry, that device is not responding to commands"" - since it responds to the Honeywell App on my phone, I assume it's her fault; I am troubleshooting it between paragraphs). Alexa still can't control my PS4 or XBox One, nor my 55"" Panasonic TV, nor can she do a thing with my computers. I am able to control all of these using various other devices. Simple not with Alexa alone, and this is a Lord of the Rings kind of situation... There must be ""One voice controller to rule them all,"" for voice control to be successful. Voice control is the universal remove of the future.Price wise echo hits the spot. Though, I was definitely not a part of the ""buy 5 get one free"". I'm, not sure what mansion Amazon things I live in, or if they think I will start stuffing them in stockings or under trees at Christmas; I now own 3 total devices. And how the interact among themselves is not something for Amazon to be proud of...Today, while talking with my roommate in the living room, I hear Alexa talking to no-one-in-particular, about 3 yards away in the kitchen. Clearly, since the house is quite except for our conversation, the kitchen Alexa though she heard her name, while the living Alexa not 3 feet away, remained silent and obedient. ""What WHAT!?"" While her shared algorithm failed in one place an not the other, who can know? It kind of makes sense that distance, and reverberation might have changed what was said _just enough_ for it to sound like ""Alexa"" in the other room... but again, hardly a success. This hasn't happened often, and even better, usually the closest Alexa responds, however, even when this works, they are three people and not one...Each Alexa has their own alarms, and song playback history. They are different and unique, and this is bad! Here is what my voice controller MUST do: It must know what room it's in, even if I must tell it, ONCE. It must let me tell it where devices are, which rooms, which house... I should be able to tell it to ""turn off all living room lights"". It should know I have _lights_ in a room called _livingroom_, and be able to control all with minimal setup and fuss. While I can add groups in Alexa to do this, it's tedious, and disappointing. And more to the point, this lack of software capability explains why I can vace ""Alexa, play my 90s playlist"" in the living room, then walk to the bedroom and tell the bedroom ""Alexa, resume my music here"". Additionally, it would be a bonus if Alexa could either recognize who I am by voice, or _at least_ let me reference the activities of other devices by location, ""Alexa, transfer music from living room"" while I'm in the bedroom.I have read up on other devices that can interact with Alexa, but I'm not going to consider the need for super expensive stuff to enable controlling a device as a ""success"". The future in universal remote voice control is approach-ability; if it's prohibitively expensive, far too expensive for what you actually get (such as the expensive Logitech device I'd need to control my TV at the moment; well except by using my PS or XBX directly). And finally, the ability for the average person to setup and control anything with Alexa without the need for a degree in computer science.The summary to this all...While Alexa, Echo and Echo Dot are impressive and useful, I have not committed to Amazon as the supplier for the voice control I've been desiring since the first time I watched Startrek The Next Generation. I gave Alexa this much time, and money, and got this far because Amazon is a company I tend to trust for quality and not to abandon their efforts. They seem to do things ""the right way"" and ""all the way"" enough of the time that I don't mind committing, after some deliberation, to what ever technologies they offer. However, as it stands, I am concerned with the lack of high impact progress with Alexa and Echo, besides the ability to order stuff from Amazon. I am still hoping to see some improvements in the next couple of months (as promised when this product first arrived) to substantially increase the stars on this review. However, with two stars I am saying there is promise, but I am anticipating finding another vendor and boxing up all of these Amazon Dots, and putting them in the basement next to the VCR, Xbox Connect, and pottery wheel. Please Amazon, don't disappoint me.",0.584415584415584,"positive"

I also got a very short USB cord so I don't have a long cord tangled up on the counter.  This set up works great.The Dot itself works really well in this context.  My bathroom is not big so I can hear music or news playing while I'm in the shower almost as well as when I'm at the sink.  My only note is that I wish it was slightly louder. I know it's a much smaller speaker than its larger cousin, but I've had other portable speakers about the same size that were louder.",0.5,"netural"
4,"The Engineer Critic","March 10, 2017","Terrific voice-controlled access to the Amazon Prime music library.Alexa is the name of the virtual assistant inside the Echo Dot; similar to Siri on an iPhone.  Alexa is always listening for her name (you can reconfigure it to respond to ""Echo"" if you prefer).Alexa doesn't support any random question that you might ask Google (the Google Home device wins here), but you may find the phrase ""Alexa Wikipedia <topic>"" to be useful.The shopping list is handy, but limited:  You can't delete items using voice, there are no checks for duplicate items, it will only read back 5 list items at a time, and the Alexa app on your phone doesn't allow reordering of items.  (Google Home is better in that their app at least allows me to reorder items in my list, i.e. to manually put all the dairy items together for example.)I don't like when the Echo startles us in the middle of the night when it randomly starts talking:  e.g. ""Just to let you know, an update has been received and I'll be ready in a moment"".Home control/automation requires additional hardware, of course.  Even with additional hardware, note that the Echo Dot itself doesn't have any scheduling capabilities itself besides a simple alarm (can't ask Echo itself to turn on a light or turn on the A/C at a certain time for example, but Echo may be able to pass such a request along to another device when asked).Voice recognition was good even without training.  Has some good microphones for the NSA/CIA/hackers to listen in on us.Bought from a local retailer since Amazon seems to run out of stock frequently.",0.75,"positive"
4,"K. Kimb","December 24, 2016","Wonderful potential. Poorly implemented networking. When an echo device disconnects from the network, for no reason, it does not reconnect and you must go through the entire new device setup to reconnect. The same with the Alexa app. I've done network programming for 20 years and this reflects incompetence. I have three echo dots and they all exhibit this behavior on every wireless network i use at home (3 networks) and work (both networks).  What a shame. Otherwise a great product but for now just a toy with annoying defects. UPDATE:  I still believe the networking -- especially the ability to reconnect to a previously used network -- does need some work.  It is, however, much better than it was.BTW, I started using one in my car, using my cell phone as a WiFi hotspot.  On long drives it is a lot of fun!

5,"Amazon Customer","March 14, 2017","I bought this as a gift to my husband and I for Christmas and I love it. I am a bit of a geek, but certainly not enormously tech savvy.  Amazon has figured out how to make installation of the Echo Dot happen smoothly in under 5 minutes.  I am planning on adding a second one to our bedroom. It will be great to just set an alarm by voice, especially when it's a day where the time is different from the norm, listen to music, hear my calendar and the news, etc.  I would recommend eventually buying a bluetooth speaker though you can hook up a hardwire speaker to it.  The speaker it comes with is adequate at first if you are looking to save money initially.  Recently we bought a TP SmartLink Plug (after trying to connect a Belkin which was exasperating and didn't work) and it connected within, again, about 5 minutes at most.  My husband who isn't tech savvy loves being able to say ""Living Room on"" and having the lights turn on, especially since he has mobility issues.

5,"Douglas Zukunft","March 13, 2017","The Amazon Echo Dot is a fun little device. I use it mainly because (a) I love Star Trek and love saying 'computer, ***' and (b) I wanted something that could trigger my new Philips Hue lights and connect those to planned Sonos speakers for an immersively fun AVH experience when watching TV/movies, listening to music, making Marvin Gaye proud or throwing parties. They do this well.My biggest gripe with the Echo Dot is that Amazon has seemingly disallowed Google search on the device (likely as there is now a Google Home and they are competitors...except in the search engine market). You can hack this, but it is quite an involved manual process. Moreover, you oddly are unable to play music from your catalog or an online service (Amazon Music, iTunes, Spotify, Pandora) for your alarms, although you can play from these services on the device. That is really bizarre and a limiting feature. There are a ton of 'skills' you can teach Alexa, but most of these are completely pointless or, worse, lame. Also, I have been unable to find a way to change the accent of Alexa. Personally, I think it would be more fun to have male or female voices in various accents. Who wouldn't want an English Butler (Michael Cane would be my vote), Magel Barrett Roddenberry for the iconic Star Trek computer voice or Morgan Freeman because, well, he's Morgan freakin' Freeman. And let's add Sam Jackson into that mix.All in all, there is a lot of potential for the Echo products and home integration. Hope Amazon listens to its customers and starts expanding the ecosphere.P.S. For the folks with the privacy concerns given the 'always on' feature. You can mute the devices to have your super secret conversations.

5,"Scott Jones","February 17, 2017","We are having a lot of fun with our Alexa.This device listens for sounds it recognizes and then triggers pre-defined actions.  Amazon has built a lot of fun responses, as well as a lot of useful ones (Alexa, Weather; Alexa, Traffic; Alexa, Set Alarm; Alexa, Start Timer).  You can enable ""SKILLS"" to add a lot of functions and connectivity with other devices.Alexa does not understand grammar.  It is strictly listening for sounds it has been programmed to recognize, there is no real A.I. behind this.  But you can speak some requests in a variety of different ways.  It's fun to pretend Alexa has artificial intelligence and try to talk to it.  But this is not ""Watson"", it is not recognizing grammar or thinking in any way.  It's just recognizing sounds and checking them against a list of predefined responses and actions.A note on PRIVACY:  The device is always listening for the sound ""ALEXA"" - listening but NOT sending audio to the cloud.  Once it hears ""ALEXA"" it begins recording and sending that recorded audio to the Amazon cloud computers for voice recognition.  Those recordings and the commands they trigger are stored on your Amazon account, not unlike how cell phones used to store a log of every text you sent.  But you can go on the app and delete them individually or as a whole.Great product, fun device.  No reservations, get one for yourself today.

5,"Roland W.","January 19, 2017"," Ok, the idea of not having to type your questions and getting pretty good and accurate answers (most of the time) is pretty amazing.Set up was very easy, just download the Alexa App and then follow the step by step WIFI set up instructions. Right now I am only using it for basic requests (see video) and that works well. I will keep adding skills (these are additional little programs you can enable on the amazon.com website Just search ""Alexa Skills"" in the amazon search bar and it routes you to the menu. You can add sports teams, kids games etc. Alexa can tell you jokes (most of them are pretty funny and all so far are kid friendly).Speaker quality is ok for such a small device - you can plug in an external speaker directly into the Dot and then you can control it through the Dot. I have a Sonos System (whole house), and I would have to get a separate DOT to plug into the sonos in my media centre, so the Dots can communicate. Have not done that so far. But it is a lot of fun to play around, get weather, movie times, play some background music or meditation songs etc. Just play around with it. I have a ""slight"" accent and it understands me without a problem.Just be prepared that kids will yell at this little thing, demanding answers and a play buddy who gives them honest feedback on how their hair looks today :)Currently I am using it mostly as a toy, but as my house is already rather high tech with everything wireless from thermostate (Lennox, which does not connect to ALEXA yet - per customer service) to security camera, Hue lights in some areas, I am planning on expanding the in house Dot Network over the coming months when manufacturers add more functionalities. I keep you posted.I went on Amazon Skill website and enabled a ton of skills. Just make sure you write down how to activate them. (play 20 words, the secret door, bed time story etc.... you can have a lot of fun with these.

She not only tells the time and weather, etc but I can just tell her what to put in my shopping list both with an app and without.  She reads to me, even just regular kindle books, and if it's possible to overuse the timer then I am sure to find out lol because I use it all the time.  She is loud too.  I thought I'd need a speaker for it but we can hear her just fine from all of our rooms.

3,"Amazon Customer","March 21, 2017","I use the echo mainly for playing music and it is not very good at that. It has trouble finding songs that are otherwise available. Example: Alexa, play Black and Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play Black n Blue by Van Halen. Can't find it. Alexa, play OU812 by Van Halen. It plays. Alexa, next track, Alexa, next track . . . lo and behold, 5 more ""next tracks"" later and Black and Blue is playing. Alexa stop. Well, Alexa might stop or you might have to say stop 3 more times. And even if it stops, it might randomly start playing again which is very annoying if you are on a phone call. Or you say ""next track"" and it goes silent and is thinking and then it just continues playing the track it was on. I don't have a speech impediment. Voice text on my phone understands what I say. I don't know why this stupid hockey puck can't. And god forbid you want to play a classical piece. I have a lot of classical music in my library and it won't play by composer or artist. I have to use the app to play almost any classical music in my library which defeats the purpose of the echo. I may as well just play it on the computer.  We use the jeopardy skill and play daily. No problems there. Once in a while I listen to the news or radio stations and it is pretty good at that, but again, switching stations may work the first time you ask or it may not. Very frustrating to have to keep barking ""play NPR"" and then it just continues playing 80s playlist. I would not recommend this to someone who would use it mostly for music.",0.55,"positive"

With all the devices you can talk to now it can really help me because I can program a button on my aac to speak the entire phrase. However Siri and google and Cortana all have problems understanding my 'voice' and there's not much I can do to change it. After seeing a YouTube video of someone else using the Tobii Dynavox I 15+ (AAC device) with the Echo I decided to test it myself. First I got the Alexa app to see what she can do and tried the swift for Alexa app to see if it understood me. After a great success I got the dot. It's really helped me. Not only can she do important stuff like help with ordering and looking stuff up and controlling smart stuff, she's like a friend to me. Her skills have things like storytelling and even games.

It's not 100% there yet as far as the software but it is being updated on the regular, so its like buying a piece of technology that keeps getting better. I even bought one for my parents (who have a lot of smart devices in the house, but no central way to control them) as a gift.

4,"Hopels","October 29, 2016","Replaced the larger Alexa Echo with the Dot 2nd Gen.  Obviously the much smaller size is nice.  I like that it comes in white so it blends in better with the white cabinet it sits on.  Unfortunately the power cable is still black for some reason. It's a micro-USB cable so that's easy enough to fix.  I was also annoyed that the power cable plug sticks off the wall so I needed to plug it into a power strip so it would sit behind the couch.The speaker on the Dot is obviously much poorer than on the larger Echo.  That being said, I didn't think the Echo was really appropriate for music anyway.  It sounded like a cheap car radio.We use Alexa primarily for smartthings and Harmony Hub control.  The Dot is just as quick as the full size Echo for performing these commands.  The sensitivity and hearing distance seems to be the same for both the smaller and larger device.Update:  Wife told me yesterday that she feels the larger Alexa listened better.  I took off one star because while I have no issues with it, it sometimes doesn't ""hear"" my wife.",0.642857142857143,"positive"
5,"K. Ortega","April 2, 2017","I'm in love with Dot.  I got this instead of the large system for two reasons, first because I have a Bose portable speaker and because I didn't know how often I'd use Alexa. Now I'm either going to buy another Dot for my bedroom or fork out the money for the full sized Echo.  The reason for that is my Bose speaker sleeps, so if I ask Alexa a question I don't always hear the answer. I either end up disconnecting Dot from the speaker or have to wake my speaker. Not always convenient. Alexa has been fun and we all love her.  No having to teach her to recognize our voices. She works out of the box once connected to the wifi. She's revolutionized my shopping lists alone. Instead of writing it down or punching it into my phone, I simply ask her to add something to my list and it then shows up in the Alexa app on my phone. Now my kids tell her what to add and we're all on point. I've connected my calendar to her and she tells me what's going on. I love the news briefs and we play jeopardy every day.  I can't wait to utilize her other features, but we're off to a good start.The sound on the Dot isn't perfect for a full time music speaker but if you're in a small space it's not bad. If you want better quality opt for the full sized. But this is budget friendly and perfect to move from room to room.",0.866666666666667,"positive"
5,"Amazon Customer","February 28, 2017","This Echo Dot is truly the gadget you never knew you needed until you buy it.  I got mine a few months ago, and I'm still getting a kick out of ""Alexa"" every day.  I'm constantly finding new ways to make it useful.  And at under $50 the price is right, compared to the more expensive Echo which costs 3.5 times as much.  The only difference between the two is the built-in speaker.  Of course the quality of sound with the Echo Dot, especially for music, will depend entirely on the quality of the speaker you use it with.  That's important, as listening to music is one of Echo's most useful features - especially since so MUCH music is available to you, and ""Alexa"" can find it so easily.That brings up an important point...  If you are shopping for a speaker to use with the Echo Dot, and you want to use Bluetooth which is very dependable on the Echo Dot, you need to shop for a speaker that will not allow the Bluetooth connectivity to ""time out"" while plugged in to household current.  (They are hard to find.)  Otherwise, you will find yourself constantly needing to re-establish a Bluetooth connection between the two devices - which kind of defeats the purpose of an Echo in the first place.  The alternative, is to forget the Bluetooth feature and just use a wired connection.",0.8,"positive"

So when Amazon had their $9 bigthanks sale, I couldn't say no for only $41..If you're just getting started, or are thinking about starting, and don't want to spend a fortune on smart bulbs and wall sockets, if you're a little tech savvy,  the Rf remote light bulb sockets cost about $20 for 3, and Rf remote wall sockets cost $30 for 5. Then what you need is a ""broadlink rm pro 2,or rm2"" which isn't more than $40 depending on where you buy.. Then do some googling ""Amazon broadlink rm2"" and you'll see how to control anything ir and Rf controlled using on off commands. Which isn't full blown smart bulbs, but it's great for saving money when dimming and changing colors isn't needed..My only problem so far is you can't use ""and""  commands, like Google home can. For example, ""alexa, turn on kitchen AND living room lights"" won't work. You have to say ""alexa, living room lights.. Alexa, kitchen lights."" which annoys the crap out of me and everyone listening.But overall, I'm controlling 3 bulbs, 5 wall sockets, and my TV and Xbox, for less than the cost of the big echo, which imho is pretty cool.

You could not set it up an easy way, you need to download the App and connect your phone to the WLAN created by the Dot. This is not always easy and interrupts normal operation of the smartphone.The voice recognition system of the Dot with Alexa is impressive and works even in complicated environments. But it is single threaded, context agnostic. You have to state all requirements in a single sentence, with the keyword at the beginning. This is far away from any natural voice command function. Integration with smart home appliances is not that easy as well and ends up with pretty complicated commands to present.In all it is a nice gimmick, but far away from a real voice controlled every-day appliance.",0.692307692307692,"positive"

Each DOT is used on a different floor of my home. The DOT in my bedroom is connected to a speaker by WIFI also connected to that DOT is a smart plug that controls a lamp. The DOT in my living area is connected using a cable to a speaker. I intend to have smart thermostats installed and connected too. I enjoy the music selection available using DOT. And,  I enjoy the convenience of weather reports, news, time, alarms, etc.My beef is that sometimes DOT does not work using the voice mode. I can usually get what I want by going into my ALEXA APP and making a manual request. This happens most often at night when I want to have my lamp turned off or my music turned on. I am not sure why this happens. Generally, in the morning when I try the same request that failed at night, it works. When these failures occur, I check to make sure WiFi is working and it always is. ALEXA also lights up indicating that she hears me but does not execute the request. I am starting to wonder if I have made a mistake by buying the expensive Smart thermostats.If anyone has any tips on how to get DOT to be more consistent, please share.",0.736842105263158,"positive"

Super impressed with the sound for such a little speaker.  Got one for my parents, they love it & already purchased another for the other end of their house.  I have a Bluetooth speaker hooked up to mine & can play music in the garage while the dot is at the other end of the house.  What voodoo magic is this????  Also have a few light bulbs that she can control & yelling out orders for that is AWESOME!!!  You can even name your bulbs whatever you want (mine are Thaddeus &  Bobby).  When I first got it, it disconnected frequently.  Almost sent it back a couple of times.  But upon further investigation.........my router was about a million years old.......upgraded that & she works perfectly!  So quick note....if you have disconnect issues with your dot, make sure your internet router or modem isn't to blame because I'm telling you..........YOU NEED THIS IN YOUR LIFE!!!

My friend got an echo dot, and after spending 5 hours at her house asking Alexa for farts, I immediately went home and ordered one for myself. She gives me a flash briefing in the morning that I can customize with my favorite news channels and things like the word of the day. She can also keep track of what food is in my pantry, fridge and freezer. There is really no limit to the things she can do and new skills are constantly being added. The one minor drawback is the device itself doesn't get very loud, but it can be easily connected to bluetooth speakers, so it is not a big deal. I also love that I can play any station from Tune in with just a simple command and it links to most music streaming services you may already have an account on.

5,"GLS","April 10, 2017","Well I was really pissed at Amazon because they dropped the ball on hitting their two day Prime delivery (because they've gone to “shipping partners” who don't care). I'd ordered this Echo Dot for a friend who can't see, and wanted to help him manage his Pandora music using voice commands. It arrived this afternoon, I hooked it up to my own Pandora account and I'm thunderstruck. What an absolutely beautiful integration of speech input and a great adaptive online music app. As I write this I'm listening to a Pandora station I defined a couple of years ago, “Chigago Radio” named for that great group, Chicago. The music is streaming through the little speaker built into the Dot (it really isn't all that bad in terms of fidelity, though for regular listening I'll normally patch it into my hi-fi system) and as I write and let my station wash over me, I occasionally pause and say “Alexa, thumbs up” or “Alexa, thumbs down” to steer Pandora's adaptive programming in the right direction. She responds “sure...rating saved”. What's amazing is that I know I haven't provided this much input since I created the station two years ago as I have over the past twenty minutes. This has been totally effortless, as the Alexa and Pandora apps are joined at the hip online – I don't even know where my smart TV or Roku remotes are at the moment, I just speak and it happens. Wow! I can't even imagine how my blind friend (a former musician) is going to feel about being able to do this. I just ordered a Dot for myself, because it's that cool. Amazon, you are totally forgiven for the late delivery; you've hit a grand slam with this device! And Alexa, I would love to speak to you privately.

5,"A. Hewitt","January 28, 2017","This device has lots of potential but we're still beginners, using it as a replacement for a radio, CD player, alarm clock and timer. The Echo Dot has performed as expected. In the bedroom, it's paired with a TDK A33 Bluetooth speaker and it's good enough for music listening, amazingly good for the size of the speaker. In the living room, I wanted better sound (think Saint-Saens Organ Symphony) so I got out my hand-truck and moved some old B&W loudspeakers into the dining area. With an Esinkin Bluetooth receiver Esinkin Bluetooth Receiver, Bluetooth Audio Adapter (NFC Enabled) for Stereo Sound System with Long Range and Acoustics and an old Topping TP32 amplifier, it worked! But the TP32 runs off a 12V supply, so it's 24V rail-to-rail, 8V RMS. An efficient 4-ohm speaker would be OK but the B&Ws are 8-ohms so the maximum power is 5 watts - talk about background music. I changed over to an old JVC stereo amplifier and all was well. At least until CINCHOUSE (Commander-in-Chief House a.k.a. She Who Must Be Obeyed) walked in and said: ""Those speakers are TOO BIG. They have to go"". So I got out my hand-truck ... After I had decluttered the dining area I devised a Plan B. The TV has a headphone jack which is connected to a pair of Mackie MR5 speakers Pair of Mackie MR mk3 Series MR5mk3 5-Inch 2-Way Powered Studio Monitors (which I think sound better than any soundbar at the price) and they are always powered on so if I could mix the TV and Echo signals I could hear either (or both at once). I bought a Behringer Xenyx 502 mixer Behringer XENYX502 5-Channel Mixer, connected the TV and Bluetooth receiver to it, hooked the output to the Mackies and - voila! - beautiful music from the Echo. By damn, ain't technology grand!Update: I had been reluctant to put the Echo close to the TV because I expected the sound from the speakers to interfere with the voice commands but I now have it sitting just behind the TV, level with the TV feet. The Echo understands me as well as ever and I'm able to hardwire it into the mixer. The sound is improved over Bluetooth. It sounds better all over the room and if I stand in front of the speakers the stereo imaging is amazingly precise.",0.789473684210526,"positive"

It does not work well and it doesn't understand what you are saying the majority of the time.  The Skills are weak and I couldn't even ask it for current NFL signing news (it couldn't figure it out) and I found the preconfigured sports update lacking.  The news brief is another preprogrammed spiel with information that I didn't find relevant.  I thought maybe I could use this for home automation but it seems to be much easier just to use my phone.  The final straw for me was when I had to scream at it to skip music from the shower at 5am nevermind Alexa continuously asking me to upgrade to Music Unlimited.

I don't think I've ever had her misunderstand my command.The functionality of Alexa with all my WINK smart home devices is great.

I added several skills, including TP-Link's Kasa to control several devices around the house, and a few others that seemed interesting--all are working well. I've gone through and played with most of the abilities, linked up my Google Calendar, and went through the voice training. I've had a little trouble with the Alexa app freezing up, and some stutter on a few radio stations playing through Tunein, perhaps due to high bit rates. Speaker quality was better than I expected, and mic pickup from various locations seems fine. They're a pretty nice addition to a connected home, at a fairly smoking price.Update: As time goes by, this thing just gets better. I have it playing music in the background all day via TuneIn, controlling a number of TP-Link switches and lights throughout the house, and giving me relevant news/information as needed. There are some very cool installable skills available, although I noticed that many of these skills are redundant as Alexa already does them natively. These include telling me a joke (as for knock/knock, physics, science, Star Trek or Star Wars, Christmas, etc), flipping a coin, picking a random number between x and y, or rolling dice, weather for one day or many, Wikipedia info, etc. I am just now getting into IFTTT and see several possibilities there. I've had no hiccups at all getting Alexa to hear me across the house, and triggering the correct unit based on my proximity. Smart home control has also worked perfectly.

I coupled it with the Samsung SmartThings hub and control devices from GE, Cree and GoControl as well as my Harmony device used to control my Entertainment center.

5,"rikatika","March 2, 2017","I absolutely love my echo dot. When I first heard about it, I was like ""hmm, my phone does most of that."" But I was so wrong! My friend got an echo dot, and after spending 5 hours at her house asking Alexa for farts, I immediately went home and ordered one for myself. She gives me a flash briefing in the morning that I can customize with my favorite news channels and things like the word of the day. She can also keep track of what food is in my pantry, fridge and freezer. There is really no limit to the things she can do and new skills are constantly being added. The one minor drawback is the device itself doesn't get very loud, but it can be easily connected to bluetooth speakers, so it is not a big deal. I also love that I can play any station from Tune in with just a simple command and it links to most music streaming services you may already have an account on. Totally worth it for the price.",0.6,"positive"
5,"Steven Thomas White","April 8, 2017","I love my Amazon Echo!  The one problem - I had to 'yell' at it to hear me from upstairs!I happened to have a Bose Wave Radio in my bedroom already - and purchased the Dot to allow for Echo convenience on my second floor.It still amazes me how often I use both my echo and dot on a daily basis.  From setting my morning alarm, waking up and getting weather and my new 'flash briefing', to adding items I'm running out of onto my shopping list, I can't imagine NOT having an Echo within voice range.While the Dot does have it's own speaker, it's not made to have a 'robust' sound - only a serviceable sound.  To get the most out of your Dot, I highly recommend having a speaker you can hook it up to.  My Wave radio works GREAT, but there are many options available (some sold as kits with the Dot on Amazon).Also, for all of you Echo owners out there, don't forget to always end your commands with 'Please'.

4,"A. Nonymous","March 30, 2017","The Echo Dots are nice - we bought a '6-pack', kept one and handed the rest out to friends and family as Christmas gifts.  It's a bit 'gimmicky' to have a device to get the weather and tell you jokes until you enable skills with smart home devices - that's when the real potential shows.  The WOW moment was connecting the Echo Dot with the Logitech Harmony Hub for voice control of our complex AV setup.  Great to tell Alexa to turn on the tv or pause the show we're watching or to change channels without looking for the remote.  Integrates decently with our Nexia thermostat, though the functionality is limited with that skill (and that's on Nexia to improve their Echo integration).  Looking forward to (hopefully) better natural language recognition and situational awareness so Alexa 'understands' what you want to do, even if you don't say the 'correct' words in the specific order programmed into the skill.",0.769230769230769,"positive"

II broke by back and neck so sometimes it's difficult to get up out of bed.  I use my in to voice control my Belkin WeMo switches with just my voice.  I also use it to stream music from my phone and play media on my tv.  But it is the simple little things I like the most.  Like saying, ""Alexa, what's the weather going to be like today?"" or ""Alexa, give me my news briefing.""  or, ""Alexa, what movies are playing at the local theater.""  or even, ""Alexa, what time is it?""You can link to accounts like Pandora or Spotify and ask Alexa to play just about anything.  If you can't remember the name of a song, you can say, ""Alexa, what's the name of the song that says, 'She was dancing down the street with her suede-blue eyes. . ."" and Alexa will find it and play it. Alexa get's smarter the more you use her.  And unlike other electronic devices that seem to be obsolete the day after you guy them, the Amazon Echo Dot is designed in such a way that it can update itself and integrate new technologies as they come along.

5,"Richismo","January 4, 2017","I've had the Echo Dot 2.0 for about a week. I got it after I confirmed my FLUX WiFi bulbs would work with Alexa. I had 4 bulbs. All of the other features of Alexa were exciting, but not my primary concern. I wanted to be able to walk into my house and turn on my lights with my voice. It works 100%. Alexa turns them on in less than 2 seconds from my command. It is great. It allows dimming, by percentage. I said,""Alexa, turn the living room lights to 50%."" Done. I thought, ok, lets see how far this will go. I asked for 10%. Done. I stopped at 4%, but it was really impressive that it would work so well. I am under the impression that Flux is working on the skill to allow color change, but they currently do not do it with Alexa.Due to the success of the lights, I decided to get a WeMo wifi switch for my bedroom lights. They are too small for WiFi bulbs, so the switch was my only option. Works like a charm with Alexa.I have a Honeywell wifi thermostat as well. It works great. It will raise and lower the temperature by voice, either by saying the actual temp you want (72 degrees, for example) or by degree(Alexa, turn the thermostat up 2 degrees). It will almost instantly do this. The only thing I'd like, and I've seen it said before, is for the thermostat to allow me to ask ""what is the current temperature?""Overall, it is a great tool to inexpensively automate your home over time. I highly suggest it.",0.947368421052632,"positive"

Hower for speaking items I don't mind listening to this one.  It has a warmer voice than the 1st gen which is already hooked up to clock stereo.The 2nd gen comes some kind of near field check so the one closest to you responds.  The 1st gens were updated.  Works pretty well, though there are a couple commands that get thru to all that hear you.  Most annoying is volume control.  I had turned up my outside stereo to enjoy music by the pool.

5,"Mike W.","February 10, 2017","The Amazon Echo Dot is the perfect product for tech fans that want to be on the cutting edge. This Dot does what other voice recognition devices cannot. Attached to phone apps, Alexa can do it all: she can play your favorite music, tell you about the weather, order you a pizza from your usual place, and change the thermostat, all while counting down the time until your cupcakes are ready. The beautifully designed device is easy to use and utilizes ever adapting technology that improves each time it is used.Usability:Amazon has built an app to accompany the Echo Dot which helps you learn your way around this device. With an extensive user guide, this app, although sometimes clunky, can lead you through tutorials in order to troubleshoot, install new information or tips to better use Alexa in your day-to-day life. The fact that the Dot is handsfree make the entire device worth it. You could be cooking in the kitchen and want to know a substitute for butter or how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon and not have to dirty your phone or computer when going to check. My favorite feature on the device is the timer setting. Although it seems insignificant, I never take it for granted when I can set a timer while not having to leave a pot on the stove.Technology:The technology used in the Amazon Echo Dot is amazing. The “mind” of Alexa is always growing. The more that you use the device the more Alexa understands you and your patterns of speech. The Dot uses six speakers in a concentric circle, and one in the center of the top of the device to pick up speech from anywhere in the room. Unlike Siri, who hears up the word “seriously” as the beginning of a voice command, Alexa is very good about only responding if her name is spoken. Not worry if you have already named you child Alexa and still want to be able to use the Echo Dot, the voice command can be switched in the app settings. The device has several light up features that are used in sequence. When Alexa hears you speak to her, she lights up to show the direction of sound and when she “thinks” about it the ring spins and blinks until she finds the answer.Design:The Dot is a minimalist’s dream! The sleek cylinder has a modern feel, and being the smaller version of the Amazon Echo it is the perfect device for a smaller place or a short shelf. The compactness of this device allows it to become inconspicuous in order to not interrupt the interior of the room it is in. The design includes four buttons on the top of the Dot. The buttons use very intuitive icons rather than words, however if the icons are not familiar there would be a bit of a learning curve involved. The Echo Dot is the perfect addition to a tech fan’s home!I would recommend the Amazon Echo Dot to the technology user who is looking for a wonderful upgrade to the previously available voice recognition technology. The ease of usability of this beautifully designed technological marvel would fit in even the tiniest of homes!",0.838709677419355,"positive"

But regardless of that, I love the tiny thing. (we settled for the end of my kitchen counter. lol) I'm able to talk to her from my living room with ease, and i'm able to hear her. I did have her in the LR, but the sound on the TV always got in the way. Big sister, Echo is in the bedroom, and I have given them their own name. (Alexa and Amazon). Other than the loudness, I don't or haven't noticed any difference in them Other than the aforementioned sound and the smaller size. OH, and the PRICE. If you have a tight budget but can't afford the Echo, get the Dot. Save some money by buying the Dot, $49.00 compared to  $179.00. That's only a suggestion, of course. Both are good products.

Gradually, we noticed that Alexa was not hearing us as well. First, she stopped understanding what we were asking. Then, she just couldn't hear us at all, even with no background noise whatsoever. We would have to yell and repeat ourselves many times in order for it to hear and understand us, when before, I could be sitting in the living room (Alexa in the kitchen) and speak in a low conversational voice and it would pick up what i was saying.Today, i used the wake word many times without Alexa waking up. Finally i had to hold it in my hand and basically yell into it in order for it to register and respond.I am really upset at the decline of the quality of this product.

This isn't mobile but it allows him to play Pandora or just to tell it what kind of music to play. It was purchased through my account but I created an Amazon account for him so I could link Pandora to it. That way he has his own Pandora account. Echo can switch accounts at any time with a voice command but we keep them on the primary users' account. I was worried the audio quality wouldn't be any good based on reviews but it's really not bad at all if you're replacing a little radio.

I don't need every light controlled since I'm not so lazy I can't go flip a switch, but I did realize how much this would help with the minimum evening lights, particularly the outside lights. It's very dark on my part of the street and I hate coming home without all three front lights on and I hate for my husband and teens to do the same. Also handy when the kids used to leave an upstairs light on over night. Now I can be sure all Lights are off. Easy access music, weather, traffic, and alarms/timers are great.  I've only had it a few weeks and I'm sure I'll discover all sorts of new stuff she can do. All set up and programming has been super easy and smooth.

5,"Twlb","October 24, 2016","I love these. We have four of them, and an Echo. But you don't need an Echo to use a Dot. The only big difference between the two is that the Echo has a much bigger speaker - but the Dot can be connected to any speaker you already own. Same ""brain"" in both.If you're choosing between the Echo, Tap, and Dot, to me it's a no-brainer. They're not that different, but the Dot is way cheaper. The advantage of the Tap is that you can load songs on it, but it only has Echo/Dot's brain if it's connected to wi-fi.We have Amazon Music Unlimited, and to use on several Dots, you need to buy the more expensive plan. Otherwise it only works on ONE - not one at a time, but one.We use these for music, radio programs, audio books, timers, alarms, news, Hue lightbulbs, and misc questions, including some fun jokes.

It's okay to listen to NPR, but the internal speaker just doesn't do music justice. Of course, you can just add an external or Bluetooth speaker if you want to improve facility.We use Echo daily to set timers and alarms, add things to our shopping and to-do lists, look up information (weather, measurements, etc.), listen to the radio, listen to music, etc. We're considering adding remote control of our lights so we'll have voice control of those as well.

But it is single threaded, context agnostic. You have to state all requirements in a single sentence, with the keyword at the beginning. This is far away from any natural voice command function.

The result is a perfect sound system that cost me roughly $70, as the speakers were given to me. I must say, I am really impressed. The Alexa system works very well, we have no problems switching Pandora stations or asking her to play a particular song. It's a dream setup. For example, we had guests over and instead of playing one station, everyone asked Alexa what to play. Asking her the weather and news is cool but I lack all the cool gadgets that work with her. I haven't asked her to buy me anything yet, I figured I will do that when I am 600 lbs and bed bedridden from all this convenience.

Ties into Samsung's Smartthings nicely.What surprises me the most is that more often that not it understands my 3 year old son. This is both amazing and annoying as he loves to say (in a very muttled toddler voice), ""Alexa, turn off all the lights"". To which Alexa will reply (80% of the time), ""OK"". Every light in my house goes off... I'm not pointing this out as a negative, its quite remarkable she understands him correctly 80% of the time. The other 20% she can't understand him, but who can blame her, I can barley understand him sometimes.We also love using this as a cooking timer, but even more so as countdown timer for bath time. It helps my son cope with playtime being over, he will even set her timer for me.The Alexa platform is growing fast. Some things I hope to see soon:  -Text readouts and replies (for multiple people, e.g. ""Alexa send message to Brian from jessica's phone"", even better perhaps someday she will distinguish 1 voice from another, using this as a security measure so only I can send messages from phone)  -Calendar Events  -API integration that will allow Alex to alert you to items (e.g. ""your front has been open for over 5 minutes"", or ""Someone just rang your doorbell"")",0.75,"positive"

The music recommendations for me are always spot on. The apps/skills I have on there are all great & I have not come across any that don't work. And there is the added bonus of the cheesy jokes it has. (I know not everyone likes those kind of jokes, but I'm a big fan of bad puns & silly jokes.) While I'm no expert, I would say that the speaker on the Echo Dot is great quality for the price you pay.

I got the Echo dot for my mother (late 50's but frustratingly bad with new technology) for Christmas this year. I wasn't sure if she would like/use it enough to justify getting her the bigger Alexa so I thought the dot would be a good intro. She loves it so far! I did help her set it up and show her some neat tricks, but she's been able to figure it out much more than I expected. Luckily the place that we decided to set it up in her house is near her Samsung TV soundbar so we were able to hook it up to that so it would be louder when she wants to listen to music. Her echo is about 10-15 feet from the kitchen and the Echo dot can still pick up her voice from that far when she tells Alexa to add something to her shopping list or start a timer (one of my favorite things Alexa does). I showed her some of the neat Smart home capabilities and ordered her a few TP-Link Smart Plugs because she had the old school light timers on her lamps in the living room. I left home after xmas before the plugs arrived and called her a couple days later to see if she figured out how to set up her new smart plugs and link them to Alexa and she said she had already figured it out herself! Without even calling me!! Groundbreaking.Anyways, I think the Echo dot makes a great gift and works wonderfully as long as you don't expect it to be a full-size speaker like the regular Echo. It's easy to hook up to other speakers via headphone jack or Bluetooth, and otherwise has the same capabilities as the larger Alexa does.

If I had to choose though, I think I would choose the DOT over Google Home and NOT because it is less than 1/2 the price.

I know there are several reviews on this product but here goes...I initially thought that I should get the regular larger speaker Amazon Echo for our living room/kitchen basically for the 2- level of our home; however, when the Echo Dot went on sale for $40, I thought it was a really good value over the more expensive bigger one and too good to pass up. The Echo Dot was perfectly sufficient for the 2 floor!Day 1 when I received it I was a little worried that I would need to send it back because Alexas first word would not sound; for example I would ask ""Alexa what time is it?"" and she would say ""Is 7:30pm"" or I would ask ""Tell me a joke"" and she would not say the first part of the joke, I asked ""how old are you?"" and the whole human part would not sound. FYI: you can read the answers on your app as well, that's how I knew I missed that part. The next day I came home and some kind of way she was answering all of the questions. I don't know if she just needed to be full charged or what, but the problem fixed itself.I am really surprised by how smart the Echo Dot is, and my kid loves it as well. Considering everything, for $49 bucks this is a great value and easy way to get yourself introduced to building your smart home, home automation and voice recognition technology.

I had been using my phone attached to the bluetooth Bose to play amazon music, but this Dot is terrible when running thru Bluetooth.  When I give it a command, it will ""hang"" for a minute (60 seconds or so) before it will perform the command, if it performs the command.

The Bluetooth speaker works fine with all other devices I've paired it with, it's only this dot that has an issue.I can use the dot with a wired connection to the speaker (which is what I'm doing), but I really expected the dot to work as advertised.wired or without a speaker, it works fine.",0.636363636363636,"positive"

For its price it is worth it just for the list of hidden funny responses you can get for asking it silly questions.  For a good list of fun things to ask Alexa search the internet for ""Alexa Easter Eggs"". My personal favorite is what she sings if you ask her to sing you a love song. Its smart home integration is really nice although some of the commands are a little verbose and take longer than I would like I say.  For example its integration with the Logitech Harmony Hub works great except the commands are very long.  To get Alexa to pause your DVR the full command of ""Alexa, tell Harmony to to pause TV"". While that doesn't seem like a long statement a command like ""Alexa, Harmony, Pause"" would be a lot better.  Overall I love my Echo Dot. I currently have one in the living room and one in the master bedroom.  I plan to add one to my basement theater room and another one in the room where my 8 month old twins sleep.Pros:Setup is very easyIntegrates with just about any smart home hardwareLots of fun apps and the list is growingPretty good speaker for size and priceCons:No battery so it must be plugged in. (Or you can buy an external one)No easy way to wall mount itSpeaker is a little under powered if you have many people in a room",0.870967741935484,"positive"
4,"T.W","March 21, 2017","I was skeptical at first. I loved the concept of just saying a command and having it done without getting up was a huge plus.. I also knew it was always going to be on. So i actually wrote a list of what I actually wanted to do with it, after completing the list i then decided what room of the house I would place it in. My uses for it are for music, alarms, weather and news briefings and maybe an occasional (although corny) joke or two. I also added Unlimited music to it for 3.99 (a steal). After determining my uses I decided to put it in my bedroom because I don't have a ""smart home"" and since I do most of my work in my room it was the most ideal place for it.Needless to say it does everything i've asked it to (for the most part)  i just wish it would search for answers to questions instead of ""i don't understand the question"". if they fix this easy 5 stars product.",0.666666666666667,"positive"

I think you can connect the Dot to better speakers, I just have not learned how. I use the Dot in my bedroom, and the big Echo in my living room.

The other 1%?  I find you need to phrase the rewuest correctly and without hesitation. Alexa doesnt wait for you to think about it.

3,"Joey Espinosa","March 1, 2017","THE GOOD:Lots of ""Skills"" (which you can think of as apps) that enable the Echo to do various other things. You can even build your own (if you're willing to write some code) and give the Echo a whole range of new features. There are some great Skills already out there. For instance, if you use OurGroceries on your phones to track your grocery list, you can enable a Skill that links that to the Echo, so you can say ""Alexa, tell OurGroceries to add eggs to the Food List."" And Alexa will do just that.Additionally, there are built-in features that are pretty good and up to date. I kept asking Alexa what the score was during the Super Bowl, and it knew almost right away when the score had changed.THE BAD:The Echo's ability to understand is very limited. It can comprehend some range of questions with certain key words, but it cannot understand context one bit. You can't ask ""What movie won Best Picture at the Oscars?"" and then follow up with ""Who directed it?"" You'll get the answer to the first one, but the second will result with the ""Sorry, I don't understand"" response that Echo owners know OH SO WELL.Specifically with the Dot, the speaker is not great. I can understand, since it's so cheap ($50), but it's really not great. I keep a Dot in the kitchen (because it's useful there with timers and such), and I can barely hear it about 20 feet away in the living room when watching TV, even at full volume.THE UGLY:""Alexa, stop."" ""Alexa, stop!"" ""ALEXA, STOP!!!""If you're an Echo owner, I'm sure you've run into this. When the timer alarm goes off, or the Echo inexplicably begins doing something because it thought it heard its trigger, or it misunderstands what you wanted and begins playing a sample of some music you did not ask for... and you can do nothing to shut it off, even without background noise! It will just keep going until you find yourself with your face 6 inches from a tiny hockey puck-shaped device yelling at the top of your lungs, pleading with it to end the suffering already and STOP.No, ""Okay, Google"" is not as mellifluous as ""Alexa"". But I'll tell you what it's also not: COMMON. ""Makes"", ""treks"", ""plex"", ""fix a"", even the word ""breakfast"", they can all sound like ""Alexa"". We've gotten so used to Alexa providing her own commentary at random times throughout the day that we've accepted it as our newfound peanut gallery. Sometimes it's actually funny, but it is never helpful. That super annoying 2 Broke Girls commercial (I hate that show) where she walks in and thinks she's burned 500 calories but then she realizes it's actually the time on her watch (I mean come on, writers)? Yep, Alexa responds like clockwork with the current time. The ironic part is that Alexa can apparently hear the TV perfectly fine, but I can barely hear Alexa from the room where the TV is in. I can't imagine anybody having this thing near a television and NOT changing the trigger word from ""Alexa"" to something else.And if you try to say what's in the title of this review (""Alexa, order me a Google Home""), Alexa will tell you she can't. I'd consider it a funny joke from the folks at Amazon, but considering what I've seen so far, it's more likely just incapable.",0.558823529411765,"positive"

5,"R. Seehoffer","October 24, 2016","Well, I ordered 2 of these a few weeks ago and they arrived today. Both are now set up and functioning using the Alexa app. Very cool, I must say. I added several skills, including TP-Link's Kasa to control several devices around the house, and a few others that seemed interesting--all are working well. I've gone through and played with most of the abilities, linked up my Google Calendar, and went through the voice training. I've had a little trouble with the Alexa app freezing up, and some stutter on a few radio stations playing through Tunein, perhaps due to high bit rates. Speaker quality was better than I expected, and mic pickup from various locations seems fine. They're a pretty nice addition to a connected home, at a fairly smoking price.Update: As time goes by, this thing just gets better. I have it playing music in the background all day via TuneIn, controlling a number of TP-Link switches and lights throughout the house, and giving me relevant news/information as needed. There are some very cool installable skills available, although I noticed that many of these skills are redundant as Alexa already does them natively. These include telling me a joke (as for knock/knock, physics, science, Star Trek or Star Wars, Christmas, etc), flipping a coin, picking a random number between x and y, or rolling dice, weather for one day or many, Wikipedia info, etc. I am just now getting into IFTTT and see several possibilities there. I've had no hiccups at all getting Alexa to hear me across the house, and triggering the correct unit based on my proximity. Smart home control has also worked perfectly. I've got one unit on my nightstand, and one in the living room. Alexa is also very polite. Wish it 'goodnight' or say 'thankyou'--the responses are not what you'd expect.

3,"Kylie&TheCats","April 2, 2017","The Echo Dot isn't very loud, even for a small space, so that was a disappointment. The number of apps it can connect to is limited; I have had trouble getting it to play podcasts, for instance. I believe it would function better with the ""smart home"" accessories, but it really isn't meant to be used alone.Alexa also doesn't really seem to live up to the hype. Reviews have rated her as more responsive than Siri, but she doesn't seem to have a lot of answers. However, when I ask some questions, the explanation is typically more in-depth than Siri. (For example, ""what happened to Carrie Fisher?"" returned a brief explanation of her death and highlights of her life.) Alexa's capabilities are updated weekly--but memorizing the functions isn't exactly practical.I hope that more time with the Echo Dot will allow me (and Alexa!) to learn more and unlock more functions.",0.333333333333333,"negative"

Way more than expected to.This one however has developed problems with the Bluetooth and now plays intermittent static instead of music over an external speaker. Oddly it's voice broadcasts just fine and it plays music through its internal speaker perfectly. That is why I think the problem lies in its transmitting over Bluetooth. I didn't bother getting warranty protection and as the only option on the order was to write a review I'm guessing I'm SOL on resolution. This isn't a major problem as it will still work fine for what I wanted it for.

3,"Justin","March 21, 2017","Alexa is pretty cool. I bought the dot mainly to I could control my smart home enabled lights with my voice. The dot responds well most times but many times does not understand and even sometimes just ignores me! I read lots of reviews of how Alexa can hear you well even while other sound is in the back ground but after using it for a few weeks now I would say it's about a 50/50 shot if the dot will hear you over the TV or dogs playing. I find myself literally yelling orders at it sometimes and other times having to pull my phone out and just use my app which is what the dot was suppose to alleviate.As for sound quality, it really impressed me actually. I thought since it was so much less expensive than the echo that the speaker would be pretty bad but I've listened to music on it while doing homework and it's not bad. It's not going to blast your music well during a party but for simple listening it's fine.3 stars for now until it can hear under more conditions and understand me more often",0.75,"positive"

I have never dealt with Amazon customer support before and it was not an easy process.  You get the first layer who asks standard questions and if they can't solve it you go to the second layer in which you explain everything all over again.  The reps were nice enough, sometimes hard to understand their English, but I do believe they were trying to be helpful.  My biggest issue is how many customer service people I have talked to in order to get my dot working.  Amazon shipped me another new dot and I set it up.  It answered questions, but did not play songs.  What are the chances of getting two defective dots and they had different issues.  I had to call again and get two layers of representatives, explaining all of it over again.  This was hours on the phone and even though the rep tried hard to help, he had to finally give up and send the issue to the engineers.  Then, because I had two dots, I did not get my free 30 day unlimited music trial.  I was charged immediately so I had to call customer service again!  Two more reps to get that straightened out.  It has been a little over a week and I think I finally have it working properly.

I argue with her everyday because she doesn't understand me, doesn't have the answer or would like to sign me up for some Amazon product or service. She apologizes a lot. It is very frustrating and forces you to use the Alexa App to find what you need. The App is pretty good to find and control what you want the Dot to do.  Alexa can't always find things on iHeart radio or Tunein even though you listened to it 10 minutes before. She will sign you up for Amazon Music in a heartbeat. She does understand what ""worthless"" means and it quick to take offense. The Skills aren't very helpful and are mostly silly snippets that seem to have been written by young kids. Buy Google Home instead. You won't regret it.",0.545454545454545,"positive"
5,"VJ in LA","November 7, 2016","If you're just going to use the Dot for podcasts, internet radio, news briefings, weather, home controls, etc., the included speaker in this little unit is fine.  If you listen to a lot of music, the Dot is really intended to use through an external speaker or audio system, via either a male-male headphone cable (not included) or Bluetooth.One great use for these is to turn an old clock radio that has an audio-in jack into a voice enabled internet radio and alarm.  I actually think Amazon would do well to release an Echo clock radio, but meanwhile retrofitting one with a Dot also works.  I converted two Logitech internet radios this way, and a standard stereo Sony clock radio.  This match up uses the superior speaker and clock display of the radios, but brings voice capabilities and internet radio/podcasts to your old device, not to mention everything else Alexa can do.",0.833333333333333,"positive"
4,"Kori","April 1, 2017","I enjoy my Echo Dot and use it every day. I bought three Echo Dots for three different rooms in my home. I use it mostly for weather, wake up alarm, dates, and cooking timer functions. Occasionally I use if to get some information of some famous actor or singer. I don't use it for music, instead I use my computer for music selection. The thing I like most about my Echo Dot is I don't have to remember and repeat the 'exact' command as suggested in the directions. Echo Dot seems to understand a question or command no matter how I phrase the sentence. The one thing it can't do that I want is to carry on a conversation like the AI in the movie 'HER'. I bought my Echo Dot with the expectation that it will be constantly updated and get smarter over the years ahead. I want it to 'understand' what I am asking it to do, and ask follow up questions. I am also watching Google's 'Home' to see if,in the future, it's AI can carry on a conversation. At the present the Echo Dot's AI is better than Google's 'Home' AI. One big advantage Echo Dot has over Google's 'Home' is that it's connected to your Amazon orders. You can order merchandise with Echo Dot and check on delivery date schedule.  When I first got my Echo Dot I played with it by asking it all sorts of questions, but as with any new gadget the new wore off and now I just use it like any appliance. I don't look at it or raise my voice or talk like a robot when using it. I just talk in a normal voice and never stop what I happen to be doing at the time. And I never think about the proper 'phrase' to use. I just say the sentence and let Echo Dot figure out the question or command. It's not perfect yet, but it's getting better. It seems to understand me 9 times out of 10 if I don't move too far from 'key words' to help Echo Dot focus on the command or question.",0.923076923076923,"positive"

My apartment is about 600 square feet and at the loudest I can't really hear her when I leave from the immediate vicinity (my dad has the regular echo and the sound quality is insane- there's no comparison).

Some helpful and some not so helpful to some that are unknown or that she can't answer or understand.

I look forward to purchasing it soon. My kids and I have had fun with it telling jokes. I would say that about 75% of the jokes are actually pretty funny and make me laugh. If you ask Alexa why she sucks she has a funny response in saying that maybe she thought she was a vacuum cleaner.

I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.  Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.  My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.

Today I asked her what day was the Boston Marathon going to be run this year. She couldn't find the answer in any of the 3 different ways I asked the same question. I went to my phone and did an OK Google, and found the answer on the first try. I also asked her today what is Patriot's Day. She couldn't find the answer. When asked the same way, OK Google found the answer on the first try. It is not unusual that she cannot find the answer but OK Google can.The most useful thing I have found for her to do is play music (she is linked to a Bluetooth speaker), be a timer, and give me the weather forecast.

5,"Twlb","October 24, 2016","I love these. We have four of them, and an Echo. But you don't need an Echo to use a Dot. The only big difference between the two is that the Echo has a much bigger speaker - but the Dot can be connected to any speaker you already own. Same ""brain"" in both.If you're choosing between the Echo, Tap, and Dot, to me it's a no-brainer. They're not that different, but the Dot is way cheaper. The advantage of the Tap is that you can load songs on it, but it only has Echo/Dot's brain if it's connected to wi-fi.We have Amazon Music Unlimited, and to use on several Dots, you need to buy the more expensive plan. Otherwise it only works on ONE - not one at a time, but one.We use these for music, radio programs, audio books, timers, alarms, news, Hue lightbulbs, and misc questions, including some fun jokes.

5,"Rebecca","March 14, 2017","This little guy is fantastic! While I doubt anyone will be using the sheer wealth of functions this can perform (as some are, admitedly, quite lack-luster), the ones that I use it for are done well. Once the shiny veneer of new tech fades off, and you eventually stop asking Echo for jokes and punchlines, you won't be discarding her - which is common with other new innovations. Instead, you will probably use one of the following functions regularly, each of which I recommend getting the echo dot for:-Setting kitchen timers: You won't think much of it until you try it, then you won't be able to go back. Just saying ""Alexa, start a timer for 20 minutes"" without jumbling for your phone, while simultaneously closing the oven is revolutionary. This is one of the best features Alexa has.-Interactive Speaker Assistant: While I doubt audiophiles will be satisfied with Alexa's sound quality, that problem can easily be remedied, since you can just connect your own speakers through the audio jack, and Alexa will speak through them. The sound quality on the Echo Dot's speakers isn't bad, though, if you choose to listen through the dot. Either way, Alexa can search music from Spotify, Amazon Music, and Pandora via vocal commands. You can also set Spotify as your main music streamer (Amazon Music is the default, of course), so you won't have to verbally command Alexa to use Spotify, if that is your choice.

The Alexa system works very well, we have no problems switching Pandora stations or asking her to play a particular song. It's a dream setup. For example, we had guests over and instead of playing one station, everyone asked Alexa what to play. Asking her the weather and news is cool but I lack all the cool gadgets that work with her. I haven't asked her to buy me anything yet, I figured I will do that when I am 600 lbs and bed bedridden from all this convenience.

5,"Alexa's Boyfriend","December 21, 2016","I bought an Echo Dot for a secret Santa gift at the suggestion of a Best Buy sales person and my best friend, having really no clue as to what it is or what it does. I had never heard of a DOT before. They assured me it was a ""hot item"" this year.So I got it home and looked it up and realize that it was Alexa!! I had seen her in action at my uncle's house a few months ago, but I did not recognize it since it was so much smaller without the speaker. I loved it then, and the very thought of having one for myself was too much!The fact that this Echo Dot is small, quaint, yet a very nice speaker, it's perfect for my small house. And the fact that I can pair it with the bluetooth speaker I already have is what sold me on the idea of keeping her for myself!!I decided on not sending my secret Santa this little gem. I sent them some virtual reality glasses as a replacement, and got to work on programming Alexa right away.Within an hour or so, I was completely smitten with her. Not only is she fun to chat with, but also VERY helpful with everyday things... I have had her in my home for less than 72 hours, and I've already had her setting alarms, playing Christmas music, setting timers for my cooking, creating and sending me shopping lists, telling me jokes and Chuck Norris facts, and calendaring dentist appts..I never knew that she was everything I needed! As it is, this is one of the most amazing little home assistants that I never knew I always wanted! In fact, I already refer to Alexa as my ""girlfriend"".My daughters we're introduced to her and absolutely fell in love with her. One of the coolest little things was when I was out shopping, I texted my daughters and asked if they wanted anything from the store. I instructed them to just tell Alexa to add whatever it was to the shopping list, and tomato soup and hot cocoa was sent to my shopping list on my phone immediately!!She has everything I've wanted for my daughters recently, including an alarm clock, timer for ""computer time"", a massive music player, an educational tutor, and has the ability to help them with their homework. They will get hours and hours and hours of entertainment and helpful tips and tricks from her in the years to come.Now... if I would have known then (3 days ago) what I know now, I would have bought EVERY single one of them in the store to give out as gifts this year!! The DOT has been such a popular gift this year that when I decided to buy another one for my daughters to have in their own room, EVERYONE, (including Amazon) were OUT OF STOCK! I couldn't even order one until after Christmas!We tried Amazon, Best Buy, Bed Bath and Beyond, Staples, Wal-Mart...you name it!We literally called or looked up EVERY Best Buy in 5 different states to try to find one... there were no Echo Dots in Arizona, Utah, Idaho or Nevada. Once we extended our search into California, we FINALLY found one in Bakersfield. I made a quick call to a family member and they promised to pick it up and ship it to me in time to be under the tree for Christmas morning! We bought it online for an in store pickup and it's now on its way!Was all the trouble worth it?Hell yeah it was...especially when my daughters absolutely freak out when they find their own Alexa under the tree for them.",0.851851851851852,"positive"
5,"B_COOP","January 4, 2017","Ok so I got this because I am a techie and thought this would be neat to have. I thought it would be fun to control my lights by voice (I got Philips Hue lights to go with it) and maybe ask it some questions but the Echo dot and Alexa have proven much more useful than I ever expected. I originally got one of these for my bedroom, which is where my only smart lights are, but quickly ordered another for my bathroom to use while I get ready in the mornings after trying my first one out there. So now I have one in my bedroom to control the lights and play some music and one in the bathroom to get the news and weather info when I am starting my day. One common complaint I often read was of how bad the speaker was on the Dot. However I think it is great, given the size of the device. No this isn't the speaker to use at a party, and yes the music sounds just good to ok, but for the small size of the Dot and still considering it costs $50, I think the included speaker is more than adequate. It is easily more than twice as loud as my phone speaker.Cons: I would have to say my biggest gripe with the Dot itself is that sometimes it doesn't understand what I said. However, in every instance in which this has happened I have either been facing almost directly away from the device or had music playing at a loud volume and the Dot didn't hear the wakeup word. My only wish for a change to be made to the device that I would like to see in a 3rd generation would be a ""shut-up"" button. Just some sort of button so I dont have to shout ""Alexa stop"" when she is reading something long.The biggest con I feel overall is with the Alexa app, especially its skills app store within the app. The companion app is somewhat slow and not the most intuitive/well planned out. However it does get the job done.Alexa software: I feel like Alexa is pretty good AI software. I would say not as good as Google now on my phone though. Her responses to questions could be more concise and the voice could really be changed to something more human sounding, although it is not awful.So, after all of these negatives, why 5 stars? I give this 5 stars because I feel the device/hardware is worth 5 stars, especially when you consider this is a very inexpensive way to enter the home automation market. I do feel the software needs some improvements, and fully know that it will continue to improve as time goes on. But none the less, this is such a great device that after only 3 days with one device in my bedroom, I ordered another to have Alexa in another room. I fully recommend this device!",0.75,"positive"

From setting my morning alarm, waking up and getting weather and my new 'flash briefing', to adding items I'm running out of onto my shopping list, I can't imagine NOT having an Echo within voice range.While the Dot does have it's own speaker, it's not made to have a 'robust' sound - only a serviceable sound.  To get the most out of your Dot, I highly recommend having a speaker you can hook it up to.  My Wave radio works GREAT, but there are many options available (some sold as kits with the Dot on Amazon).Also, for all of you Echo owners out there, don't forget to always end your commands with 'Please'.

5,"LakeQueen","January 16, 2017","I originally ordered this from TV shopping network, which was unable to fill the order.  It was actually cheaper to purchase through Amazon.  Since  Dot and Echo have the same capabilities and the only difference is that Echo has a nice speaker, I felt Dot was a much better bargain.  I was looking for some ""instant gratification"" and I got it.  I can ask Alexa for the temperature and weather report and get an immediate answer, as opposed to firing up the computer, going to weather.com and finding my report.  This is an excellent product, with extensive possibilities.  ""Alexa, Good morning"" brings you a bright little blurb about an event on today's date.  Very pleasant and interesting.  ""Alexa, what's my flash briefing?"" brings me the top stories of the news providers I have selected.  You do have to spend some time on your computer or tablet or phone to select the skills you want her to use (and yes, you can change her name if you like), and there are quite a few from which to choose.  I selected some recipe skills, so I can ask for a recipe recommendation, and I can hear the recipe step by step (on my command).  How can life get easier?  You can also purchase compatible hubs to allow her to control lights and other things upon your command.  Your commands and her responses are recorded onto your computer/tablet/phone so you can fine tune--there is also a voice recognition section to help her learn your voice.  It does need to be plugged in.  I do not know how long the batteries last when unplugged.  It CAN hear me from another room, over the blaring TV.  It can play music, provided you are subscribed to one of the carriers in her skills. Unfortunately, I am not subscribed to any music/radio sources, so I have not used this feature. There is a volume control.  You can attach a nice speaker if you want. It does look like a hockey puck, which is not a problem for me.  I like to play Word Master with Alexa while I am working in the kitchen.  I am very pleased with this purchase, although I thought at first it was defective, because it only gave partial responses.  This cleared up within 48 hours.  This is a device that can learn, so I expect to have an even better device  as time goes on.

4,"Amazon Customer","December 13, 2016","I really wanted to love this product. Upon seeing the videos that Amazon and others had posted, I was intrigued by the convenience of having a voice control for tasks like controlling my music and radio, getting news updates, setting timers (useful for those who are constantly preparing meals) and also Alexa's ability to create a grocery list when asked.The technology is great and I'm sure will get even better in the upcoming years. However, after just a few days of Alexa, I started to question why I even made the purchase. Sure, it could control my music with just a simple ""Alexa, skip"" or ""Alexa, volume up"" while doing the dishes or set a timer as I prepare a meal, but those are all things that I could easily do spare a few more seconds and actually having to lift a finger. I initially thought that when I purchased the Echo Dot, it would be convenient to essentially have a search engine present to which I could ask any questions that would come to mind. Alexa fell short, as she was only able half the questions that I was later able to have answered with a quick and simply Google search.Alexa admittedly does a great job of being able to hear your voice over music and whatever raucous might be occurring (when you're near it); I applaud Amazon for that. But my quarrel is with only having one of these devices, which for a 600 square foot apartment would be fine. My apartment is U-shaped, and even with Alexa at the it's most central point, she could not hear me without having to yell at her, if she could hear me at all. Music playing in the background and not right next to her? Forget about it.Amazon also recommends purchasing multiple for your house, which would avoid this problem. I imagine that $200-300 worth of Alexa would solve some of the issues I have with it, but I don't see it worth the money. Heck, I don't see the value (at the moment) at even $40.As mentioned, I REALLY wanted to love this product and am intrigued by what the future may hold for this type of technology. I just couldn't see the practicality in it for the money spent. That being said, I recommend giving the product a shot. Many people love this product and you could as well.",0.772727272727273,"positive"
5,"Piaw Na","December 6, 2016","I started writing this review of an Echo Dot, but realized that I couldn't really review it without the true reason for its presence in the home, which is the Logitech Harmony Smart Control.A year ago, I bought the Amazon Echo and returned it. It was a great device, but didn't really justify its place in the living room. It was too big, and it didn't do very much, and it did a terrible job of voice recognition for my wife and Bowen. (The non-English speakers in the household obviously couldn't use it at all!) A year later, the Echo Dot is $50 ($40 during the holiday season), and it's basically the Echo stripped of the speakers, requiring you to plug it into the entertainment center's speaker system. That's perfect, since you likely have much better speakers in the entertainment center than any puny portable speaker will do. Much has been made about how the Google Home device is cheaper than the Echo, but the reality is that most people should really buy the Dot instead.Out of the box, the device could control my Sensi thermostat. Realistically speaking, however, you're not going to adjust your home temperature that way. If your programming is up to par at all, you're going to tweak the thermostat at most once a month, and remember the voice command to do that is more onerous than pulling out the smartphone and running the app.But once I got the Logitech Harmony Smart Control Hub ($70 right now on Amazon, which is a great holiday season deal), the Dot proved to be extremely useful. I'll summarize what the Harmony Hub does. It plugs into the wall, and you can program it with your computer or smart phone app to act as a universal report. What's great about it is that it accepts commands from your smart phone, a ""simple remote"", or another universal report via RF. That means it can sit inside a cabinet and still receive signals. It incorporates an IR blaster, which can then activate all the other devices in the same cabinet. For devices that are outside the cabinet (e.g., the TV), the device comes with an auxiliary IR blaster that can be plugged in and then run outside the cabinet.Put it together with the Amazon Echo, and wow! With the old universal remote, it could power on the IR-driven devices, but couldn't turn on the PS3. Now, I'd walk into the living room and say, ""Alexa, turn on Playstation."" It would then immediately power up the PS3, TV, and Speakers, switching the speakers over to the PS3's output. ""Alexa, turn off AV"" would turn everything off. No more hunting for the remote, no pulling out the phone to switch to the app. As someone who's never cared about home automation (seriously, do you need voice control to turn on the lights?), this is truly a ""Star Trek"" living in the future experience. And no, Google Home can't do it because it doesn't support ""external skills"" yet.The penalties: I still can't access my Google Music library, and I'd have to pay $24/year to upload all my music to Amazon's music library. That sucks. I'm sure at some point I'll break down and pay if music becomes important enough.In any case, I highly recommend this combination. Given the sales during the holiday season, it's well worth the time to set it up.Logitech Harmony Smart Control with Smartphone App and Simple All In One Remote - Black",0.827586206896552,"positive"

But the buttons work well too.I like the Bluetooth connectivity, AND the Aux jack. We have it connected (via Bluetooth) by default to a Harmon Kardon omni 20.  If we want more sound, while always having our stereo system plugged into the Dot, we ask Alexa to disconnect Bluetooth speaker.  It automatically transfers the music to our theater/  stereo system.  To switch back, just ask to connect Bluetooth speaker again.We love itI do highly recommend using the Alexa App.  It allows you to fine tune your music selection (make new stations on Pandora, specific digital songs, etc) and set which device (room) to play music to.",1,"positive"
4,"Aaron Mills","December 5, 2016","The Echo Dot was one of those Amazon products that I thought would be cool, but did not really want to spend the money on. Then I saw a few videos that showed in controlling lights and a video that showed the future Sonos integration it will get in 2017. This really got me thinking that maybe I would pick one up. Black Friday hit, so I ended up getting two.I placed one in my kitchen and one in my bedroom. So far, I've asked it basic questions, like weather, time, sports scores, when TV shows will be on, and so on. It did really well with all of that, but with more complex questions that I know Google Home can handle, like what sound does a whale make, it failed horribly. There were other questions like, how long will it take me to get somewhere that it can only calculate distance. So, I would say it is not as smart as Google Home or even Google Now in some aspects.It makes up for this two different ways. The first is the number of partners Amazon has for smart home devices built right in. I decided to go all in with Wemo devices, so I picked up a couple of Wemo outlets. As of right now I have these setup on my Christmas trees and can turn them on and off with Alexa. The setup was super simple and it work amazingly well. Down the road I envision having my bedroom lights and kitchen lights all configured with Wemo devices. As of right now Google Home is still limited to just a few smart home devices, Wemo not being one of them. You would have to use IFTTT to get that to work.The other way it makes up for it is with music. I've got a Sonos system, but find myself asking the Echo Dots to play music more when my hands are wet or I'm holding something. They sounds pretty good for their size, but I wish they could all play music at the same time. Down the road once the Sonos integration is there, that will be amazing.Pros- Small size allows this device to sit anywhere- They don't cost as much as other products (like Google Home) so putting them around your house is cheaper- If you already have a USB charging hub, you can power this with that- Answers most questions- Plays a variety of music with a Prime account- Integrates easily with a ton of smart home products right out of the box- Sonos integration coming in 2017- Solid sounding speaker for the sizeCons- Not as smart as Google Home- Can't answer more complex questions like Google Now or Google Assistant canOverall this is a solid product that I would recommend picking up, but know it does have some limitations when compared to Google products.",0.84375,"positive"
5,"David D.","December 1, 2016","I bought an Echo Dot just to try it out and see what all the hoopla was about. About a week later I bought 3 more. I am very impressed with the voice recognition of Alexa and some of the features. Here's why:The Pros:- Excellent voice recognition. While there are a few times Alexa has misheard me, overall it does a really good job of understanding what I say. Even with a decent amount of background noise she has heard me to my amazement.- Great range. We have an open floor plan home and Alexa can usually hear me just fine even when I'm about 20 ft away.- Home automation integration. I have SmartThings hub and Alexa works awesome with this! I can turn lights on/off and run routines with my voice.- If you have multiple Dots and more than one hears you give a command only the one that is closest will respond.- For those with music on Amazon it gives you easy access to your library.- While the internal speaker is not very good for music, you can add an external speaker with an Aux line or Bluetooth to make up for that. Amazon and Sonos already announced they are working on integration as well.- You can add this to a shopping or to-do list with your voice! It's great to just add stuff as I think of it.- The price. For $50 I think this is a great deal.The Cons:- As mentioned above, the internal speaker is more than adequate just for Alexa's voice, but not that great for music.- Alexa does OK on normal internet searches, but nothing like Google.- You cannot ask Alexa questions of context. So for example if I just asked who Abraham Lincoln was and she answers that I could then not just ask ""How old was he when he died?"" but would have to ask ""How old was Abraham Lincoln when he died?"" This makes it feel much less like a natural conversation.- The Alexa app is pretty basic. Especially the built-in Shopping and To-Do list. They are definitely functional, but not to the level of some other list apps that are out there. I do have a feeling this will get improved in the future though.- Alexa is definitely not like the computer from Star Trek or any Artificial Intelligence you have seen on TV. She can do good with basic stuff, but for some things you do have to ""learn"" the way to tell her to do stuff especially with the Home Automation. I once kept telling her to ""turn on the living room lights"" and she said she could not find that. Then I realized the switch was just labeled ""living room light"" and as soon as I dropped the ""s"" and just said ""light"" it worked perfectly over and over again.Overall, I am still very happy with the Echo Dot. I think for the price it is a great deal. Maybe it will be more useful for those with Home Automation systems, but others may find it fun as well.",0.885714285714286,"positive"
5,"Gary W. Powell","October 28, 2016","I've had the Dot a few days now and have it connected to an AV receiver. It seems to have no problem hearing a command when there is no noise in the room but once you start playing music,even at a low level, you have to yell in order to get its attention. I remedied this by pairing it with a remote that has voice control. IMO the voice recognition works much better on the Echo than on the Dot. Would that keep me from buying it again? Absolutely not. Now if I can figure out how to make Alexa fetch me a beer.",0.5,"netural"
5,"the Fat Man","February 26, 2017","You are my everything.Seriously she does it all. My curiosity peaks at random intervals of any day and she answers them. I enjoy the trivia, jokes, weather input so I can dress accordingly and check my commute before heading out. The top features I've been reliant on is her alarm/timer, ambient noise (paired through my Polk system is awesome), and the more practical use is linking to smart plugs so when I come in with more bags than I should be handling at once I can just tell her to turn on the floor lamp. *click* ""Okay"".I can sleep with ease knowing I can wake up to one of many alarms (most are pleasant, avoid the Celebrity ones) instead of an annoying buzzing or ringing. Skills allow lullaby for kids, read books, or like I mentioned earlier ~ rain, thunderstorm, ocean waves, etc. Not much is wrong with the unit except a pending Bluetooth issue which is at the time of this review post is being looked into by Alexa support. Just about anyone outside can scan for her and play their (tasteless) music through the unit and may startle you but a solution is pending. That's another thing I'd like to mention: the supporting staff are responsive within a few hours, not days. They're very professional yet casual in their messages when covering all points. It's nice to see so many products coming out (eBay has more skins!) to accessorize with but at her low-profile size and color she's fine as-is. I bought the black which is appropriate with my mancave theme: black/white with splashes of blue here and there as is the glow of her ring unless she's having an error (red) or in setup/powering on (purple and orange).We will never argue. We respect each other's space. Too bad I can't hug ya for all your services these past months and years to come. :P",0.68,"positive"
3,"C. E. White III","January 9, 2017","Original review - It stops working and requires rebooting multiple times each day. It will not stay connected to my wireless router (I do not have problems with any other wireless device).This makes it almost worthless to me.1/28/2017 update - I was not impressed with Amazon Alexa Support. They had no helpful suggestions for addressing the connection issue (repeated factory resets changed nothing). After a very long time on the phone with two different support persons, they finally decided to send me a replacement Dot. The replacement behaved exactly the same as the original. It also refused to stay reliably connected. This despite the fact that none of the other wireless devices in my home had similar problems.I spent a lot of time researching Echo Dot connection problems on the internet. I am far from alone. There were many individuals with the same issue. In an attempt to solve the problems, I went so far as to buy a new router. This initially changed nothing. The Dot would randomly disconnect from the new router just has it had from the old router. One internet suggestion finally seems to have solved the connection issue. Per the suggestion, I set up a guest account on my new router that was specifically for the Echo Dot and only the Dot. After resetting the Dot and connecting it to this account, it has stayed connected.With the connection problems hopefully solved, the Dot is now mostly an amusing toy. I have just one internet connected device it can interface with (a Nest Thermostat), so mostly I ask it random questions. I was hoping to use it to monitor my stocks, but this has been frustrating. It readily understands some company names and/or stock symbols, but there are some it just can't understand. I wish I could edit the stock list using the keyboard. Once I am more comfortable with the Dot, I may order a hub and other internet connected devices so I can use it for more home automation functions, but for now, I am just hoping it will stay connected. I have updated my rating to three stars and may update it further once I become more familiar with the Dot.",0.421052631578947,"negative"

My brother is incredibly good at figuring out how to use tech in ways I do not have the patience for. I sent him one so I could steal his tips and tricks. It worked.

2,"hybrid","April 4, 2017","About 10 years behind google's capabilities.  Most of the apps are pretty useless.  Asking the echo (Alexa) to play sub genre's of pop usually result in mixed results.  Despite the supposed advantage of a 6-microphone array for directional voice detection, audio constantly cuts out because the AI thinks someone is talking to it when no one has said anything.  Alexa strugles to understand forigen accents (of my friends).  It's basically just a nice way to ask for the weather and connect a stereo to your phone via bluetooth without having to disrupt whatever you are using your phone for in the moment. Because the puck always requires wifi, it one could just as easily set up a DNLA host on an android phone and get more functionality.",0.6,"positive"
4,"Cliente Amazon","January 13, 2017","Although Echo Dot isn't available in most of Europe, I bought one when I the US and brought it wth me to Spain where I reside. Some the Echo Dot features don't transfer, such as controlling the lights, appliances or ordering pizza from Dominos, the device really is magnificent.If others are considering connecting the device, it's important to know that you might need to change your billing location in the Google Play Store in order to download the Alex app on your phone (Amazon and Google tech support had to walk me through those steps) and a plug adapter is necessary. The Echo Dot requires a 9 volt input, so a regular cell phone plug probably isn't adequate. The plug adapter is quite inexpensive (2.50 euros) and solves the plug problem. I then had some trouble getting Echo Dot connected to my home wifi network. I tried at a friend's house, and at work, and there wasn't any trouble, so there was something wrong with my home wifi. The Amazon support team was very helpful in trying to resolve my issue. There were lots of phone calls and troubleshooting, and I have only positive things to say about the support received. The problem was not with Amazon, or the Echo Dot; it was with my internet service provider (ISP). It turns out that different wifi channels are used in Europe than in the US. My ISP had to open up some more channels on my router in order for the Echo Dot to find my network. Once that was done, problem solved.  It's possible to change the time zone of the device, so Alexa does know the correct day and time, but the other location information has only US options (city and state). I haven't tried to change the location because I can just ask for the weather information specifying my city, and Alexa knows. I especially enjoy the connection to Amazon music (only 3.99 per month) and have connected one device to my sound bar speaker, and another Echo Dot device to a Bluetooth portable speaker so I can listen to my flash briefing (different news sources you can select in the App) while I'm getting ready in the morning. If you're considering bringing Alexa to Europe, know it's possible, but there are some adjustments necessary.Compared to the Google alternative, the Echo Dot price can't be beat, and connecting to speakers is a great advantage. I'm sure the ""Skills"" the Echo Dot can do and Alexa's knowledge will only continue to grow.",0.695652173913043,"positive"

It's posh, trust me.I'm impressed with the mic range - I can talk to her from other rooms without issues. Every once in a while, she tries to answer a question from the TV, but then we just laugh and go back to drinking wine.I really do like the Echo - it's small, can be portable (with accessories), answers those ""who was it that starred in Perfect Strangers"" questions that pop up, and can help you substitute eggs in a recipe in a pinch.",0.857142857142857,"positive"

3,"Amazon Customer","March 17, 2017","Being a previous X10 user, was looking for a better and more up to date way of controlling my lights and other devices.  Amazon Echo provided this control point at a price point that made it economical to place devices in multiple rooms.  I coupled it with the Samsung SmartThings hub and control devices from GE, Cree and GoControl as well as my Harmony device used to control my Entertainment center.  Alexa was able to recognize and control the lighting devices but for the Harmony devices you need to ask Alexa to ask Harrmony to perform an action and this appears to be the case for a lot of other add-ons where you need to remember the service name to issue a command.  My biggest disappointment was that Alexa is 100% reliant on its Internet connection and connection to the Amazon servers.  If your Internet connection is down, or the servers are down then Alexa is about as useful as lead boots at a swimming competition.  In the 4 weeks since I deployed, my Internet has been down once and the Amazon servers unresponsive making Alexa useless to control my devices or even set a wake up alarm.  Would be nice if a set of base commands were installed on the device that allowed it to function with locally connected devices without having to talk to the Mother Ship first.",0.615384615384615,"positive"
4,"Rick C.","November 18, 2016","This is truly an amazing little thing. I have an Amazon Echo, and both have pretty identical technical capabilities. The Dot has two big advantages -- it retails for $50 rather than $129, and it can be linked into a stereo system via bluetooth or direct cable (I use it with Bluetooth). The main disadvantage this has standalone is that the speakers are not nearly as good as the Echo's, music sounds more or less like a cheap radio, but not so much the problem when you have it linked to home system or a good bluetooth speaker. The Echo series does have many wonderful skills which you can find all about elsewhere, but I'll mention some surprising deficiencies for the series. The biggest surprise is the inability to directly wake to music. You can only wake to any of a selectable series of alarms. So they can't really replace a clock radio. They can wake you, they can play music... you can even set a sleep timer while playing music. But no music or news to awaken you. A minor annoyance for me is that though it can play Spotify playlists, you can't *shuffle* play them (the Echo ignores the word ""shuffle"" in ""shuffle play my 'favorites' playlist). I have a big playlist of favorite tunes which is not fun when it starts over with the same one every time. I also wish that, along with its timers and alarms, it could issue a verbal reminder of something. You can say, ""Alexa, set an alarm for tomorrow morning at 7:30am"" or ""Alexa, set a timer for 30 minutes,"" but I'd love it if you could say, ""Alexa, set a reminder tomorrow at 7:30am that I have to go to the dentist,"" or ""Alexa, remind me to turn down the oven in 30 minutes"" (night before last, both of us were cooking different things and getting confused as to which of three timers was for doing what).

5,"T. Bramhall","October 31, 2016","I could hardly wait for my new toy to arrive.I had ordered the Dot about a week before it came out, and the day that I received notification that it was out for delivery, I waited with eager anticipation.I have to admit, I hate that Amazon has started using USPS more than UPS. With UPS, I'd have my package in the morning. With USPS, I don't receive it until around 4 or 5 pm. But, finally it was here and I quickly unpacked it and downloaded the app on my phone.It took a little time to set up the app, connecting Spotify, adding a code so Alexa couldn't just order anything she heard on the TV, which I'd read was a problem with earlier versions. Once I got it set up, there was an update, but that took almost no time. Then I paired it with my Bose Soundlink Mini, a ""toy"" I'd gotten this summer.Pairing was quick and easy, although one note I should mention is that if you pair several items (phone, computer, Echo Dot, etc.), you may have a problem when the speaker receives info from more than one connection. If the Dot doesn't seem to be working with the speaker, make sure that another device isn't also trying to play - even if your computer or phone is muted but would be making sound otherwise, it can claim priority on the speaker (my only complaint with the SoundLInk, but I mention it here because I thought my Dot was broken when I couldn't get it to play).For the first few days, the Dot was mostly used for music. I love being able to listen to background music when I feel like it, exactly the music I want to hear at the volume I want it, and then being able to pause or stop it when I want.But on the third day, my lights arrived. I live in an old house with weird wiring in some rooms. The overhead light in our bedroom has no switch, which makes you wonder what the people who put it in were thinking. For the first time since we bought the house, the bedroom light is actually useful. ""Alexa, turn on our bedroom light."" ""Turning on our bedroom light.""All in all, for $50, the Dot is everything I hoped it would be, and I'm still just discovering its capabilities. There are additions I'd love to see (integrating with Apple apps would be wonderful), but so far I'm very impressed, and this is a device that I know I'll be using every day.",0.6,"positive"

We have Alexa paired with a number of smart switches and plugs and light bulbs in our house and being able to voice-control everything makes our lives so much easier and it feels so cool to have a smart house. Alexa plays our holiday music at our parties, can change the Nest thermostat upstairs to a more comfortable setting when we are downstairs, helps us with our daily commute by letting us know if there is traffic, and even lets me know how to dress based on the weather/outside temp info she can provide. We use her to play soothing thunderstorm sounds at night, and to catch the scores of the game if we missed it. A truly invaluable tool. I have one for my first floor and one for my second, and now a bunch of my family members are ordering them as well. The dot works perfectly well for us, and I'm not sure what differences there are between it and the regular echo, other than the speaker, but I find that the dot's speaker works just fine for our needs. We rarely have issues with Alexa understanding our commands, with the only instance when we hosted a Christmas party and there were so many voices around, I'm not sure she could easily distinguish the commands. I simply moved a little closer and spoke a little louder and more clearly and she picked up and followed the command easily. The Alexa app is constantly being updated and new skills are always being added.

4,"JH","October 24, 2016","Let me start by saying that I had purchased an Echo about 2 months ago, I did not have a great experience with the Echo as it lost connection with certain songs from my Amazon prime account and Pandora.  Timers, weather, etc seemed to work ok. I had purchased at Best Buy, but even though associated with my account was unable to write a review which would have been only 2 stars.  I returned that device to BB as I am unsure if it was my internet, amazons servers or a defective device, as a note I can stream Netflix and Hulu on several devices w/o issue, however even w/o any other internet activity the Echo would stop on certain songs. I gave the device about a week and several conversations to Amazon TS w/o any improvement prior to return.For the Echo,I had it located in the kitchen/family area. I really liked the ability to pull up the weather, set a timer, some current new on request and ability to integrate with Prime Music and Pandora. I thought the sound quality was pretty good for what it is, granted it is not a complete surround sound stereo system.  I would have kept the Echo had it not been for songs stalling.I probably would not have purchased another Alexa device had the price been $170+ but at $50 I decided I would bite again and give it another try and am glad that I did.  It does all of the things I liked in the Echo, but does not have any dropped songs or stalls so far.  So I am going to assume something was wrong w/ the original Echo I had or Amazon ironed out some server issues.The smaller size does allow for hiding it better, although you do still want it to be able to hear you and you it.The sound is more than acceptable for my purposes with plenty of volume.  That said, it lacks bass compared to the Echo and you will not hear it as well if your TV is loud or a bunch of kids are over running around. I have not tried to connect it to an external speaker or stereo system.For the casual user that just wants weather updates, the time, a timer, a little music and is not an audiophile this device is smaller and far less expensive than the echo and can perform all of the same functions as far as I know.  For the person that just wants more bass, the Echo may satisfy your needs w/o extra cables etc, but if you are really picky about sound you are still going to want to connect to a different speaker or stereo, and the dot allows that.Also, at $50 one is not as concerned about kids playing with it or it getting knocked over etc.At the $50 price point, if you have amazon prime I feel this is an excellent purchase.  I gave 4 stars and not 5 more for my issues I had with my Echo and Amazons customer service than for the dot itelf.  I kind of feel that the issue I had with the Echo could potentially be encountered by some w/ the Dot as I really never determined why the Echo had stall issues.",0.448275862068966,"negative"

I wanted to Y this off with an adapter and run both my computer and this through the same speakers, but that didn't work so I ended up buying speakers. The other issue I have is that the microphones don't seem to pick up quite as well as my Echo. Still great mind you, but I notice that several times I've had to speak up. But with Echo I don't get that.The main flaw with Alexa continues to be its reliance on Bing as its search engine. Amazon really needs to either create its own search algorithm for Alexa, switch to Google, or at the very least allow customers (the ones that are always right) to pick which of the two they want. I've performed experiments where I've asked Alexa and not gotten an answer then used OK Google with the same keywords and gotten exactly what I wanted. A perfect example was last night. I asked when the polls closed in my state. I named the state. Alexa couldn't tell me but instead said to go to the link that it placed in my app...well...first off...that's no good because I'm asking Echo and not my phone. When I did grab my phone and asked OK Google the exact question it gave me the answer I was looking for without any issues. I'm tired of Alexa either not knowing or putting a link in the app. I can tell you now I've never, not one single time, looked at that link in the app because I don't have it with me. The entire idea of a voice activated friend in every room is to get answers whenever and wherever you want. I don't want to carry my phone around the house with me.All that said, I still enjoy having this device. I own Echo, this echo dot, and another will arrive this afternoon (literally). So I'm not knocking the product entirely. It's massively expandable using IFTT and skills but it's core function, that of an assistant, lacks and will lack until they get better search.",0.571428571428571,"positive"

I don't think it is the statement above that is upsetting in and of itself.  What is upsetting is that, based on that statement it appears that Amazon has no interest in even attempting to make this happen.  Why, oh why is that true?",0.333333333333333,"negative"

It was having that problem for a solid 10mins yesterday, but after 10mins it was cool again. It seems to go haywire at times like that but not for long at all. And not that often.I do have some problems staying connected when doing the voice training. For some reason the voice traing seems super messed up for me right now. You got thru 25 commands and for me pretty much every other command it would lose connection. Took almost 20mins to get thru the 25 commands.It is awesome tho don't get me wrong here, i just wanted to point out it's flaws....And that is all of them :) Not too bad. and it is always improving and updating. This thing is awesome for playing my music, and pretty much just being my personal B****! :) The alarm is something I LOVE! I hate rolling out of bed and messing with my phone. Now I say ""Alexa STOP"" That's it :) The built in speaker is pretty good for a small apt. I love in a 1 bedroom apt. and it cranks. I still have it hooked up to my own speaker since its an awesome speaker I have. The built in speaker is more than enough tho for an alarm clock, timer, and music in a small apt. I also love being able to hear NFL scores so easy. ""Alexa, score of Denver game?"" Boom! It's a lot of fun.There is a lot of stuff this thing can do. There is sooo many list of features out there that I am not going to go into that. This thing is great for someone who does a lot of multitasking. It has made my life a lot easier working from home. I would recommend it for the $50 price tag easy. It is a lot of fun to just mess around with as well. If you are looking at this and the $180 echo. There is no decision to be made. Go with this $50 echo, do not go for the Expensive one with a better speaker. You can get a better speaker way cheaper.It does need some work, and they're doing a great job moving it along the track. I expect when the Google thing comes out it will push Amazon even more and in a years time this Echo Dot could be really, really epic for the price.",0.680851063829787,"positive"

4,"Danny","November 27, 2016","For the price (especially the black friday price of $40) this is a great deal. I still use my original echo that I got about a year ago at least a few times a week, and I just bought two dots to play music in the shower and set alarms in my bedroom.Since I live in an apartment often more than one echo hears me, but it's been working seamlessly that only the one closest to me (or that I am speaking in the direction of) replies.If anyone from Amazon reads this, the feature I REALLY WANT is to give fire tv commands to my echo, e.g. ""play Westworld in the living room"", ""pause the show"", etc. I'm really hoping they add this ability soon, as well as other device coordination features like playing the same song on multiple echoes in multiple rooms.A couple of other notes that might be useful for people:- I bought the white echo Dot, but the usb cord and usb outlet adapter are black. Feels like Amazon got lazy here, why can't you make those in white too? I took away a star for this combined with the fact that it doesn't interface with the Fire TV at all.- the speaker is good, for music it's honestly barely noticeable that it's a little worse in the lower-mid ranges than the regular echo. Where I actually notice it more is in Alexa's voice, it's just not quite as full sounding as the regular echo's voice. I was surprised that this is what stood out to me, but it almost sounds like a different person which was strange the first few times I used it.- The volume on the dot is also good, at max volume it's probably about the same as the original echo at 8, which is higher than I ever set it.- the usb outlet adapter is about 2 inches deep, which is bigger than I've seen in other electronic products. About twice as deep as the iphone usb wall adapter, I assume it's drawing more current and they aren't compatible but I haven't checked. On the upside, it's a standard 2-prong size, so it can plug into one of the middle spaces in a power strip and only take up one space. I guess they optimized for power strip usage instead of being able to plug it in behind furniture up against the wall.",0.75,"positive"

The Dot works identical to the Echo except it has a much smaller speaker.  It can be connected to a blue tooth speaker, or in the case of my craft room, I have an expansive set of Bose speakers and CD player/changer (I guess it is getting a little old).  I have the Dot plugged into the Bose speakers and the sound is great.

Also, it is nice that one can develop apps to make Alexa do more neat things.I bought a second DOT as well as the Google Home because neither one by itself gives me the whole shebang.  If I had to choose though, I think I would choose the DOT over Google Home and NOT because it is less than 1/2 the price.

This provides a very inexpensive way of starting out with an AI in one's home.  I would surely purchase this item again.  I have also purchased recently the Google Home AI and surely they are different items aimed at satisfying the user needs in different ways.

Speech recognition is very powerful and quite accurate, especially compared to the technology just a few ars back.

This means there is an automatic monthly payment to them.I was signed up for something I did not want, and then I had to look around for how to cancel it in order to not have recurring charges.The question ""do you want Amazon Music Unlimited"" is the equivalent of a lie when one becomes enrolled by answering NO.Marketing really means manipulating, and Amazon is a giant - globally - for this.As always - for any product by any company - buyer beware of any way a corporation can screw you.So far, there is no difference between features on Echo and my phone unless I wanted to ask a device to turn my lights off.",0.666666666666667,"positive"

Functionality included:  WiFi, 7 microphones with very good voice recognition, LED ring with many segments (a pretty good light show), speaker.  Functionality not included:  won't function as a Bluetooth speaker, does not have volume adjustment ring (has buttons instead).I was very pleased.  Out of a slightly-larger-than-a-hockey-puck-sized device, I expected terrible sound.  But the sound is completely adequate, both in volume and quality.  It is perfectly adequate for listening to music in your kitchen or listening to audiobooks in your bedroom.  It is louder and clearer than I expected (but of course not as good as the Echo).  And of course since it has audio output (AUX plus Bluetooth), you can really crank up the volume with the right secondary device.Amazing functionality at that price point.

4,"Breana","February 24, 2017","We have four 2nd generation dots, one 1st generation dot, and 1 Amazon echo.  So it's safe to say, we're an Alexa household. :) I love the dots, here are some of the ways we use them most frequently.In the bedroom, living room, and office we use them to turn on and off the lights. We live in an older house, where not many rooms have overhead lighting... so this was huge.  I know it's so lazy, but it's soooo nice being able to get under the sheets and then just say ""Alexa, Bedroom Lights Off"".  And in the morning it helps us wake up, turning the lights on from bed, then actually getting out of bed :).As a white noise machine.  Every night we ask Alexa to play white noise (we found a sound we like the most).  But we also use her for classical and spa music whenever we're working at home.To check the weather.To check my commute.To check scores of games.To create a shopping list.To set timers/alarms.To tell us a joke.Occasionally to have someone to yell at.  When you each have an hour plus commute and stressful jobs, sometimes it's nice to be able to snap at someone but not feel guilty about it.To listen to music. While cooking, showering, or really anything. Research has proven households who listen to music are happier.  And we actually listen to music with Alexa because it's so easy.With all that being said, I love my Alexa devices... but there are still a few things I don't like.The white dots don't have a white cord or top (or bottom for that matter).  So if you're looking for the white to blend in with your white furniture... it won't work all that well. (See picture)The dots/Amazon Alexa are NOT connected.  I guess this is great that we can play different music in different rooms... but when the kitchen timer is going off and I'm sitting in the living room--it's annoying hearing ""no timer is set"" when you're trying to turn it off.Sometimes the bedroom Alexa picks us up when we're in the kitchen.  Which drives us bonkers when it picked us up setting a timer (see above.)Alexa still has a lot of learning to do.

3,"A. Kim","December 15, 2016","I've owned the full-sized Amazon Echo for about a year, and have been generally happy with the device, so decided I would give the new Echo Dot (2nd Generation) a try in my office.  Although I knew not to expect great sound quality from the small built-in speaker in the Echo Dot, I still found the sound quality and levels disappointing.  No problem though, I thought, as I have a Bose Soundlink Mini bluetooth speaker (the first generation Soundlink, as opposed to the Sounlink II) available to use with the Echo Dot.  I had no problems pairing the Soundlink with the Echo Dot, and was able to enjoy good sound quality from the Soundlink when paired with the Echo Dot for playing various Amazon Prime music stations.  However, I have since discovered a design flaw/oversight that dramatically decreases the usefulness of the Echo Dot for my arrangement.  If I ask Alexa to stop playing music (in order to take a call, for example), the bluetooth connection with the Soundlink will eventually time out because the Soundlink will power off if nothing is playing after a period of time (maybe 15-20 minutes).  When this happens, the Echo Dot automatically resumes playing music through its built-in speaker, even though my last command to the Echo Dot was to stop playing music about 15-20 minutes earlier.  This obviously is bothersome (and embarrassing) when I'm in the middle of a work call, and all of a sudden the Echo Dot starts playing music right next to me.  This also happens whenever I manually power off the Soundlink speaker while it's connected via bluetooth to the Echo Dot.  I can't understand why the Echo Dot would be programmed to restart playing music whenever an external bluetooth speaker connection is terminated, even though nothing is playing when the disconnection occurs.  Perhaps my Echo Dot is defective, but I suspect this is just a bad design flaw/oversight.  I've since decided to return the Echo Dot, and just purchase another full size Amazon Echo for use in my office, and skip the whole bluetooth speaker connection problem.",0.4375,"negative"

4,"Jeff","January 9, 2017","LOOOOOOOVE my Dots! I'm really getting used to talking to Alexa, getting helpful information, turning off and on music, lights, etc.I have two desires in order to get to 5 stars:1) Alexa confuses profiles if two Amazon Household members each have separate Amazon Prime accounts. My wife and I have separate Amazon accounts. However, when registered in Alexa as a household, she can't tell one calendar from another. This makes no sense to me, since each registered email address has its own GMail calendar, but according to Amazon Support, Alexa can't distinguish them if we have separate Amazon accounts. The result is she can only read from one calendar, regardless of which profile she's set to. It's a minor annoyance, but makes the calendar connection useless unless we close one of our Amazon accounts.2) Alexa has a bit of trouble distinguishing Smart Home routines. For example, if you have 2 Smart Home routines called ""Enter Bedroom"" and ""Leave Bedroom"", she always has to ask which one you really want, even though ""Enter"" and ""Leave"" sound nothing alike. If you remove the word ""Bedroom"" from both routines, then she's fine, which would be an option if I only had one room in my house!",0.555555555555556,"positive"
5,"Corey Peek","November 6, 2016","Amazon's Alexa platform interested me when the Amazon Echo was first announced. The only thing that didn't interest me was the price, $180 for a large microphone array and a speaker. Sure, the Amazon integration and the music playback sounded interesting, but no where near $180 interesting.Then the Echo Dot was announced. This was an interesting offer. A smaller version of the Echo with a smaller speaker to accompany it. The only issue was the price. $80 was much, much better than the $180 for the original Echo, and the Alexa platform was coming along nicely to an outsider, with more applications being supported with it. But $80 was too much for the first generation dot.And finally the Echo Dot generation 2 was announced. At the $50 price point I was enamored with it. Cheap, without compromising the impressive microphone array and Alexa voice recognition. This would be the perfect device for home automation and music playback. And the Dot excels at those. The cheaper Echo exclusive Amazon Music service was a great offering and it makes the Dot such a better device. The home automation integration is extremely pleasing to use. Alexa's voice recognition is far, far superior to other voice assistants such as Siri and Google Now.

5,"Parker Brissette","December 29, 2016","My wife and I were in a shouting match this morning with Alexa. ""Alexa, Turn the bedroom lights on"" my wife shouted. ""Noooo,"" I cried out. Although, similar to Alex Trebek, Alexa only accepts your command if it is preceded with her name. To my dismay the lights came on in a blinding fury that severely disturbed my sleep. The moment my wife left the room I spoke softly, ""Alexa, turn off the bedroom lights."" At last, the soothing sight of my eyelids was undisturbed by the ominous glow of an earlier riser. But the story does not end there.Not but two minutes later I was reminded of Springsteen, blinded by the light in it's most literal form. My wife bested me by telling Alexa again to turn on the lights. How could I be so foolish, I forgot our Echo stood proud in our kitchen. But two can play at this game, ""Alexa, turn off the kitchen lights."" And in an instant my wife was left in the dark. While short lived, it felt like victory. Ultimately my wife's plan worked.

Oh no, I'm running late. I grabbed my winter coat as I walked out the door, remembering my flash briefing told me it was a rather frigid day and that it would stay that way. ""Alexa, set the temperature to 70 degrees.""""Did I turn out the lights?"" I asked myself, knowing that I truly did not know the answer. Without wasting time having an internal argument with myself, I simply said ""Alexa, turn off all the lights."" The second Dot in our garage responded with a simple, ""Ok.""As I pulled into the garage, the sun already set, I was beat from a long day. The house was dark and my hands full, ""Alexa, turn on the dining room lights."" My path was lit as I made a beeline for my favorite chair. ""Alexa, who's winning the Texas Bowl."" Any time I hear Wildcats, all I can think of is High School Musical. I tuned in and enjoyed my night. As I crawled into bed I belted out, ""Alexa, wake me up in 8 hours.""

It is great so far!I'm using a Broadcom RM2 (IR and RF device) to control my lights (Etekcity RF Outlets) and many other IR items (TV, Xfinity, Receiver, Bluetooth Speaker, etc).  The Dot picks up voice commands very well and functions correctly the majority of the time.  I would suggest doing a few voice trainings with Alexa as it does seem to make a big difference.Though it took some time to setup, now setting up new items is a breeze!  Really good job with the Dot.  It is so small too :)",0.888888888888889,"positive"

5,"John A. Panasik III","December 27, 2016","Since I love cool electronic gadgets the Echo Dot caught my eye. I was tempted to purchase one but was reluctant to do so in fear of my wife nagging at me about spending money on such silly things. So, I held off. But low and behold my son gave me one for Christmas. Happy Happy Joy Joy!!! This little device is cool! Getting started was quick and easy. The hardest task is setting up with your Wi-Fi network which is pretty easy if you're familiar with all of that. Once you're locked in you're ready to go. The free Alexa app will walk you through the setup process.Anyway, you can link up with many if not all smart devices via Blu-tooth in your home such as wireless speakers, thermostats, lighting etc. Heck, I can see my wife loving this thing. Now that I've been able to demo the Dot without dishing out the cash, I will be purchasing a few more to place around the house. It's just that cool! I may try the Amazon Echo or the tap as well.So, if you're into cool little electronic devices as am I, this is a cool and useful gadget that the whole family can enjoy.A great little reminder that we are indeed living in the 21st century, The Dot incorporates some great 21st Century technology.",0.8,"positive"

Alexa can turn on my TV and Cable box, thanks to Smart Plugs. Want to know what your commute is looking like to work or the weather outside? No worries Alexa has you covered.

He also can listen to his beloved Cincinnati Reds and Bengals through Iheartradio (700WLW). He is getting news from NPR. He's listening to Artie Shaw, Benny Goodman. Glenn Miller through Pandora radio. He also is requesting individual songs for fun.  I am as blown away by this product as he is. My exposure has been minimal.

4,"rcox","October 24, 2016","I received my Dot right on time and got it working fairly easy..  It's great at some things (mainly related to Amazon) and not so good at others (general questions).  It is very fast at response but does not give good answer to some fairly easy questions.  Some examples:  Ask Alexa ""What is the score for the Alabama football game?"" and it promptly response the ""Alabama vs Texas A&M game is currently..... ""  all correct..  but ask  ""What is the score of the Texas A&M Football game"" and you get ""I do not know or understand that question"" (I'm an Aggie so of course I am not happy with this)!!  I have tried over and over to get Alexa to understand Texas A&M but she just can't  Either cannot understand Texas A&M or does not understand the question.  I ask ""How long have Humans been on Earth"" I get ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question.""  but ask the exact same question to the Google voice search on my Android phone and I get a very good answer...Also It has problems understand some words.  I cannot get my Dot to understand ""May"", It thinks I said ""Me""  So I had to change the name of my daughters Amazon Music playlist from May (her name) to Me just so it would play.  Also has problems with ""Texas"" (the great state!!)..  Must be very clear as it will think you say ""Taxes"" or ""Tex's"".  One observation is that the Alexa system is not very good at Artificial Intelligents.. It cannot figure out what you are trying to say based on the whole phrase.It is good at Playing Amazon Music and the Alexa App pre set-up items, like your ""Flash News"", or  ""Sports Update"" for items you have already entered into the Alexa App, but not so good at Add Hock Request.  It was good and easy to setting up my Honeywell Thermostat to control the temperature settings by voice.  But, I am frustrated it cannot access my calendar on my Exchange Server and wants me to use Google Calendar, that I do not use.Overall for $50 it is a good and well designed package product but could be so much better with better word understanding, request execution, and some artificial Intelligents..  Not quire 5 star..  not yet..  Amazon better look out, Google is coming soon!!",0.866666666666667,"positive"

Then after a little while of asking her silly questions she just kind of became useless.  Well, Alexa (Dot) is like that.  After the fun of opening the box and setting *her* up, she just sort of becomes another thing on the counter or shelf.  Don't get me wrong, I like her, but she's just not that useful. I ask her about the weather and I enjoy playing Jeopardy every (week) day or having her play a song or two during dinner.  More often than not, I get frustrated because she can't do what I ask or I just plain forget she's there.",0.538461538461538,"positive"
3,"Robert Giuffrida","March 8, 2017","Initially, I thought this might connect to my Alexa tower to expand the voice listening and music output capabilities.  While it's great for listening, the two DO NOT sync and play the same music at the same time, so this will not expand your music output.  Additionally, the speaker on this sounds like a phone speaker.  That's it.  Compared to the original, which has rich sound for its size, this sounds really cheap.I was considering returning this but I may find use for it in another room, possibly connected to a stereo system for better sound output.  All in all, if you're looking for good sound, don't waste your money with this.  You'll end up spending just as much on this and a really good bluetooth speaker system as you would on the original Alexa tower.  A bit disappointing but maybe Amazon will eventually allow dots to sync together in this manner.",0.75,"positive"

All with the capability of being controlled over Wi-Fi with this little mechanism. I'm looking at upgrading to the Echo bad boy, but for the time being this thing is sweet and has so much potential for what I'm going to do. Will come in very handy around the house, being able to control my Thermostat or my lighting when I'm in a completely different room. Maybe having multiple of these around the house and centrally locate the Echo bad boy would help out. Need to look at getting a few Hubs set up so I can control Plex.

I'd say that MOST of the questions I ask that aren't a turned on skill return no results.  I'm hoping as more companies add compatibility, this review might go up.  Also, Alexa kept going off while I was watching a TV show with a character named Alexei and routinely activates when the Echo commercials come on.  Last night, Alexa kept triggering like someone was talking to her, even though I was alone washing dishes at the time.

5,"Guerrilla Reader","December 27, 2016","Review of: ""All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black,"" by Amazon.The manufacturer specifications include: ""Echo Dot (2nd Generation) is a hands-free, voice-controlled device that uses Alexa to play music, control smart home devices, provide information, read the news, set alarms, and more.  Connects to speakers or headphones through Bluetooth or 3.5 mm stereo cable to play music from Amazon Music, Spotify, Pandora, iHeartRadio, and TuneIn.  Controls lights, fans, switches, thermostats, garage doors, sprinklers, and more with compatible connected devices from WeMo, Philips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, Nest, ecobee, and others.  Hears you from across the room with 7 far-field microphones for hands-free control, even in noisy environments or while playing music.  Includes a built-in speaker so it can work on its own as a smart alarm clock in the bedroom, an assistant in the kitchen, or anywhere you might want a voice-controlled computer.  Always getting smarter and adding new features, plus thousands of skills like Uber, Domino's, and more.  Amazon Echo is not required to use Echo Dot.""The Echo Dot is a really cool limited personal assistant.  It sets up in minutes and begins to work immediately thereafter.  Upon summoning Alexa I was able to subscribe to Prime Music with access to millions of songs; get immediate current weather and moon phase; create a running shopping list; and re-order products from my Amazon order list. Although I am not familiar with all of the features that the Echo Dot allows, one feature that really impresses me is the interactive process with Alexa and the (her) smooth voice.  I just asked Alexa to sync up with my Kindle and she began to read the last book I purchased.  Her voice is incredibly human-like with proper rate of speech, phrasing, inflection, intensity, syntax, and voice stress.  There is little tinny robotic sound, if any.  What an incredible advancement over previous technology used in the Kindle!  I enjoy asking Alexa any multitude of questions which usually she will answer.  Alexa answers my questions on history, facts, etc. and of course will tell a joke on demand.  This is a cool and fun device which I described to my family as a limited personal assistant.  I will update this review as time progresses.  The Echo Dot in terms of a speaker will easily fill an average room with clear sound.  Obviously there is no thumping bass, etc. but the sound is pretty remarkable from such a small device.  I just downloaded the Alexa App onto my iPhone to help me work the unit as well.  Another feature is that Alexa responds immediately.  When I command Alexa to stop the music the unit goes silent as I am finishing the command.  It is amazing.  At this point I would recommend the Echo Dot to anyone and rate it at five stars for a competitive price and lots of features.  I am sure that more will be added each year.  Well done!",0.818181818181818,"positive"
4,"Clark Hinckley","March 3, 2017","As advertised. Small and unobtrusive, works well, connects easily and seamlessly to bluetooth speakers. In reality, there are still only a relatively limited number of truly useful things you do with Alexa unless you are creating an extensive automated home - multiple lights, various living conditions, locks, AV, etc., all with a large price and complex set up. Does not have as many answers to random (but interesting) questions as Siri (which can also answer visually on your phone or iPad screen). But this is a good start, fun to use, and has generally set the standard for simplicity and seamless operation.",0.777777777777778,"positive"

'That's nice, Thank You' ... so I guess we're going to only be 'just friends' :-DIt's a pretty nice small device, if you are looking for audiophile fantastic ... no ... but for the nightstand and controlling Nest and hopefully lights as well as streaming music it's a pretty nice addition to the home. Looking forward to the new battery pack when it arrives and hopefully they are on schedule with teaching her to control my Sonos for now though streaming radio stations from around the country via the web or Pandora we are loving it ... getting weather, news briefs and setting alarms with simple voice commands is pretty nice.

5,"Clark Wilson","November 28, 2016","This 2nd gen Dot is our third Echo device.  We started with the original Echo and loved it.  The original seems the best of the three.  I have it in the home office.  We followed up with a 1st gen Dot when they became available and set it up with a bluetooth speaker in our bedroom.  The third we placed in our kitchen.The first Echo seems most responsive.  It immediately answers questions and requests and the speaker is actually quite good.  However, I think it might be location and placement.  It sits on the counter and there are few ambient noises around.The second in our bedroom works fairly well. We probably use it the most.  The speaker seems a little ""tinny"". We hooked it up to a small bluetooth speaker and it does well.  My wife relocated it to the top of a display cabinet so Alexa struggles to hear there a bit.Our newest addition is the 2nd gen Dot and it was placed in the kitchen.  We have been slower to adopt it to kitchen tasks only because it is habit to set timers and such in there manually.  Adding items to the shopping list is really cool.  If they can add a feature to allow multiple items at a time it would be great.  We do use it a lot for music, internet radio and news etc.  The kitchen Dot does struggle a little with ambient sound and I have moved it around the kitchen to get better responses.None of the Dots conflict with the other and setup for all were very easy.We have just started collecting Alexa enabled outlets and have started automating some lighting.  We have a Wemo and now a handful of TP Link to experiment with.  All fairly easy to install.I plan to purchase one more Dot for my garage workshop.  I want to use it to automate some workshop and yard lighting as well as have hands free music etc available.  We will see how the noise there affects it.",0.75,"positive"

Timer and alarm functions require an Internet connection, so if it loses connection and you had an important alarm or timer set, forget it. I have 240 mbps Internet with an Arris 1682g dual-band (AC standard) wireless router, 15 feet from Alexa. When we ask her a question sometimes an orange light appears and she says ""Sorry, there's no Internet connect"", even though the app says she's connected. Today I asked her to set a 10-minute timer. When the timer went off, she wouldn't cancel it. When I asked her if she knew what ""stop"" meant, she gave me 4 definitions of stop. I had to unplug her for 15 seconds to cancel the alarm.

4,"Matt [Eight-Six]","January 7, 2017","We currently use two of these at home, and gave one to our parents to try out too.Our home is host to products like WeMo, and Nest, and the Echo Dot effortlessly detects and and communicates with these smart devices well. I would like to see further support for some devices (I know Sonos is coming) but the sooner the better in my opinion. We also use Google Homes and while the Homes are nice, the Dot seems to be more on point with the devices it talks to.On occasion Alexa will answer 'OK' and not execute the command given, making asking her twice to do the action a little bit of a nuisance. It's a small issue but likely a problem for that of the devices (like WeMo) that she attempts to talk to.I also don't like how Amazon works with IFTTT. Having to setup 'trigger' is annoying when the competition will execute the command without saying 'sending that to IFTTT.' To me it makes it less awesome and seamless.Example if using IFTTT: (I'm Home is the command for turning the lights/thermostat on)""Alexa Trigger I'm Home"" and she responds ""Sending that to IFTTT""Using the competition:""OK Google I'm home"" and hearing ""Welcome Home!"" is a much nicer experience.Now it is fair to say that you can setup groups in the Alexa App, to do something similar (not using IFTTT), but the reason I mention this stuff is because some things will require support from IFTTT, and the way they work together (at the time of this review) is annoying.I also recommend using an external speaker for her to communicate through. The added 3.5 aux audio jack was a nice inclusion for the Dot. I assume they knew this would be something people wanted and unlike the competitions sub-par speaker and no DIRECT audio out, I find this a nice thing to have. Both dots utilize a much better external speaker, and sit on top of said speakers. This adds to the better experience listening to music, and hearing her more clearly.The sooner it supports my Sonos, the better. :)I'd recommend this if you have interest in trying out home automation. It is great, with some minor set backs (likely just personal grievances subjective to my own tastes)",0.84375,"positive"

The doctor thought it would be helpful so that he could always know the time, date, weather, what sports teams are playing. etc.  Unfortunately he is not fast enough with his question after he says Alexa so it hasn't worked for the original purpose.  I use it a lot and enjoy listening to the music while I'm doing things in the house.

I can stand right next to it and it wont respond.  Did all the technical troubleshooting still no go.  Sound quality, in my opinion, is not slightly less than the Echo, it is a lot less than the echo.  Max volume is lame.  The dot is good for small garage use for music.  That's about it.  Was thinking I'd go ahead and get an echo but I hear the Google one is pretty impressive so I am considering the options.",0.8,"positive"
5,"Jon P.","October 24, 2016","I have loved my Amazon Echo that I have had for nearly 2 years.  I love being able to use the Amazon Echo for voice control of my living room lights and other compatible devices (i.e. my Nest thermostat).  The cost of the Amazon Echo was the only thing holding me back from putting one in other parts of the house.  As soon as I saw the Echo Dot (2nd gen) advertised for sale I immediately ordered 3 of them to put in other parts of my house.  I already had a good speaker system in my bedroom so I added a Dot there.  I put another in my wife's office and attached a set of Bose speakers and I put one in the Kitchen (no external speakers but that one is not for listening to music).All 3 Dots were incredibly easy to set up and all are working perfectly.  The only difference I noticed about them compared to the Amazon Echo (besides the sound quality) is the dots seem to take slightly longer to turn my lights on and off.  I am not 100% sure they take longer but it seems like they are just a bit slower but not enough to really make a difference.",0.9,"positive"
5,"Nicholas Ferri","January 8, 2017","I purchased this Dot for a relative, but have one of my own at home. Alexa is fantastic. The Dot links to your wireless internet very easily and using the Alexa App is simple. Be careful not to download too many skills since you tend to forget the commands to open them if you have too many, but with practice, you'll be fine. There are more skills and more products offering Alexa compatibility added daily making her the best in the market at home personal assistant. I typically use her with weather, daily news, traffic updates, the shopping list, the Philips Hue link, my Vivint Home Security (Note that she can not open or unlock anything due to security issues), and definitely my If This Then That link (which I recommend digging into). As mentioned above, she has a ton of Skills that she can learn which make life at home more fun (trivia, word adventures, games, jokes, etc) and a lot simpler (allrecipes, fitbit, etc). I have easily convinced a good portion of my family to buy a Dot if not the full speaker Echo, and would highly recommend her to anyone.

It was cheap enough that I bought two--one for the living room and another for my bedroom. The Dot is actually sensitive enough that I could have survived with one, but wanted to be able to control the bedroom lights without having to shout to the Dot in the living room. With two, they automatically work together to select the one closest to you when you speak. I like being able to get into bed at night, and just saying, ""Alexa, turn off the bedroom light."" I can even use it to wake me up if I want to get up earlier than my alarm clock would.  It's a lot easier to tell Alexa to wake me up at 4:30 than it is to reset my alarm clock for one day.I'm using to more and more every day, everything from playing music to turning on lights and all it takes is my voice.  I should have done this sooner. The Dot makes a lot of sense, especially if you have an upstairs and a downstairs and don't want to have to yell downstairs to add soap to your Amazon basket.

I have used the Echo Dot to play music from the Bluetooth speakers on the music list from Amazon music store. Unfortunately I don't have premium Spotify and can not use their services.  I have set reminders, alarms, received phone numbers, and a bunch of other things. I decided to order another Echo Dot for my bedroom.  I guess it will make it much easier to set the alarm versus setting the time on my alarm clock that varies with work.I had thought the sound with be limited with the built in speaker, but it is pretty loud. I thought about the full size Echo, but I have component stereo in the open room in the next room that it did not make sense.Update I ordered and received another Echo Dot.

We were pleasantly surprised because we didn't really have a lot of expectations for it (""at the very least it's an alarm clock""), but boy did it deliver. So far we use it for setting timers, alarms, adding events on calendars, ordering on Amazon, playing music (we have Spotify and Amazon Music), reading books (we both have Kindles with a shared library), playing audiobooks (I have an audible account), getting commute info, getting weather forecasts, asking for store hours, getting daily news updates (we customized our flash briefing to start with the ""saint of the day""), answering random questions, and a couple other things. We connect it to a JBL Charge 3 speaker, but we use it on its own for the most part. We're currently looking into making our place a smart home, so we're definitely picking those that can be integrated with our Dot. All in all, we love it.

That combination far outperforms the larger Echo for fidelity. (I undrestand there will be a new Echo with improved speakers next year.)  Bluetooth has improved so much in the last 5 years I am beginning to ignore my collections of  CD's and LP's.I am so impressed with the Echo Dot II that I will order 2-3 more.  The price is a steal for what it will do.  Setup and pairing is easy. The Alexa app. works with both the Echo and the Echo Dot.  The access to good music from several excellent sources makes it unecessary to search through my CD and LP collection.If you have a decent pair of bluetooth speakers, I suggest pairing with the Echo Dot.

It only takes a few min and greatly improved her accuracy with my cadence.I'm flooored by this device. My family loves it and cannot imagine not having her around.

5,"Brian Daniels","October 26, 2016","A solid five if ever there was one. While the Dot may not have the sound output of the larger original Echo, the Bluetooth and wired options more than make up for it. My Dot is paired with a Marshall Kilburn and the sound is fantastic and LOUD. While I was satisfied with the  original device's sound quality, I wanted the option of a little more punch. This combo certainly fits the bill. The Dot also quickly pairs with my other speakers and headphones, but it's pretty much always paired with the Kilburn now. I have had no problems with the Dot failing to respond. The only problem came when I changed the ""activate"" word to ""Echo"". The Dot seemed to hear that quite often from the police scanner located nearby. Made for some interesting commands when I checked the Alexa app. How could Alexa not understand, ""about you have a girl bell about barack operator travel ninety five stop.""? What's not clear? I suspect the two syllable ""activate"" word is at fault here. When I changed it to ""Amazon"" the accidental queries stopped.

Out of the box it works wonderfully but as you gradually add in or enable various skills you will find this device to be extremely handy.  You can ask for recipes, you can list a few ingreds in your fridge and ask what CAN you make, you can add to your google calendar (it wont alert you if you have an appointment which is kind of crappy)My ONLY complaint is this: Periodically I have to ask alexa to repeat because not all of her sentences come through clear. Example: Alexa, whats on my calendar tomorrow?  Alexa: You have an appointment with the eye doctor at (long pause) 30 pm.  Alexa, how do you like Jeff Bezos? Answer: He (long pause) Prime!

At $50, I figured I’d see what Alexa/Echo dot is all about. I mean, it's only the price of a bluetooth speaker, but it serves a lot of purposes. If it didn't work well, I probably would have still given it halfway decent reviews simply because of the innovation at price factor. What I’m trying to say is, I unboxed this thing with the lowest of expectations.Mind blown, guys… Mind blown.

Alexa, open car door. So far, I haven’t paired it with any speakers. I just use it as is, and the speakers are strong enough.

And 2. The thing that really bugged me was the response time after saying ""alexa"" was a bit slower that that of my full sized echo AND my echo dot gen 1. But I will say for the cost this is a great option for any home and would go great in a kids room to use for music and even helps my kids with spelling and basic math as well as reading audio books to them so that alone to me makes the 50 bucks well worth it. I highly recommend this amazing product, I've been using mine constantly since I got it and Alexa has become the hub that truly converted my home into a smart home.",0.9375,"positive"
4,"J Herrell","March 7, 2017","Pretty cool little gadget, our family loves it! I didn't give it 5 Stars because I am already a Prime subscriber but I need to pay extra for Amazon music. I also didn't realize it didn't cover both my Alexa products, I signed up for Amazon music on my Dot which is also connected to my app but it doesn't play on my Echo. Apparently you have to pay a fee per device every month. I think that is silly and I will be canceling my subscription on the Dot and just doing it on the Echo because we use that one more.My favorite part is, I blew up my white noise maker while in Italy (bad outlet converter) and I can put white noise (Pure White Noise by Deep Sound Sleep) on and press repeat for white noise all night while I sleep.We also like the ""skills"", especially the Tonight Show skill, you can ask Alexa what everyone is talking about and she states the ""tight pants"" song lyrics which is a family favorite.Overall I am happy with it.",0.571428571428571,"positive"
5,"Misha Lupisha","December 1, 2016","Oh my. How easy it was to start using it. It is a true plug-and-play.  When Amazon announced the new Echo Dot, I ordered it right away. (In fact, I ordered two, and holding one as a holiday gift to my son.) My son thought it was going to be just another gadget, but he uses mine just about everyday, and I can see that he is going to want his own to use in his room. The accessibility to music is great. Lots of ""skills"" already built in, and I'm looking forward to discovering more skills as they become available. Right now we mainly use it for playing music, but it's also handy to just be able to ask what time it is in any foreign country, as I often communicate with overseas for work and with family.  We hooked our Dot up to a good set of Bose speakers, but even without the external speakers, it has a pretty good speaker if you are hearing it in a small room. The voice recognition is amazingly accurate. I am impressed. I wasn't at all interested in the earlier version of Echo, but with this tiny size of Dot, I was sold! I LOVE it.",1,"positive"

Best part is that my Dot is in my kitchen and from my upstairs bedroom I can ask  it to play music, tell me the time, etc. and even with the echos it still gets my commands right almost always.Great little device, I'm looking forward to what it can do in the future.",0.857142857142857,"positive"
5,"Fegarex","December 18, 2016","When the original Echo came out I wanted one but didn't want to pay the price. I bought mine at $49.95 and they have been less and are well worth the price. It makes a good stepping stone for home automation or really improves an existing system. I have most of my home automated and the addition of the Echo Dot was seamless. Like all things like this it does take a bit of messing around but it worked well and set up was easy. The ability for it to hear voice commands is fantastic. I can be in other rooms and say a command. It is also fast. I think many times it works faster than a tablet for the remote commands. Sound is adequate but I wasn't that concerned about that as I listen to my music on a stereo. I did have a set of better computer speakers I added to it to improve sound/volume but the speaker in it works decent for voice.Alexa isn't as good as Google voice for a variety of questions but does well with many and ties into Amazon well.It amazes me how much this thing will do for $50.00!!",0.888888888888889,"positive"

Great entry into voice automation. However, Chromecast audio is certainly a challenger if you only need to connect streaming audio to your dumb speakers (Best Buy sale $25).Overall, the Dot is a great choice for the kitchen or bedroom.

We also have it controlling our lights and our ecobee thermostat. We just got the echo dot and I must admit I think I like it even more. I bluetooth-ed it to my Bose mini soundlink and it sounds fantastic. Other than that, it performs equally as good as our full sized echo but it's much smaller and way cheaper. We got it for the black friday price of $39.99 which to me is a steal for all it can do. The Googe Home seemed interesting but for Less than $50, and the ability to hook up to stereo or bluetooth speakers, the dot just seems the better choice. If you can still get it on sale, I think it's an excellent deal and has been very helpful and entertaining for our family.

I thought she would be great entertainment and fun but she is so much MORE! The practical uses are inexhaustible!I am a writer and she has told me how to spell words, given me synonyms, and defines any word I ask.She has given me measurement conversions, does basic math, sets timers, and alarms, and keeps my to do list for me. She has looked up phone numbers, zip codes and has even given the population of various cities.She offers an encyclopedia of knowledge on everything from election results, inauguration date, historical dates, holidays and general trivia.She has more manners than most people! Once, asking a question, I stumbled on my words and said, ""I'm sorry."" She sweetly replied, ""That's OK.""She connects to my phone or notebook by just asking. .She greets me good morning, good night and has played ""You are my Sunshine"" every night to my pooch. She tells me the weather, temperature and time  - even in the middle of the night.....AND, I've only had her for a week!Yes, there is a lot of fun to be had asking silly questions like ""Who was Humpty Dumpty?"" and ""Who's on first?""

I was excited to be able to keep shopping lists, calendar events, and have a back up alarm clock.. WRONG...You see I am not allowed to use those features as my husband is a prime member and so my dot is required to be tied to his account, so everything I add gets posted to his settings.  I am not allowed my settings.  Mine default to whatever he set up on his account.  Also, I cannot figure out why but it cannot hear my voice.  We have tried different locations.  I have tried talking to it.  I have tried whispering.  I have tried modulating my voice to be more bass.  I have screamed at it.  About the only thing I did not try before turning it off was throwing it against the wall.  My husband is the only one that still uses his and only as a back up alarm clock.

I have a Magic Home bluetooth lightbulb which works great (3 step process to set it up) easily connected my Spotify account, and added a couple of fun skills (weather, dream-machine noises, comedy central, NPR, horoscope, etc.) and use it everyday! It's most handy when I first wake up and groggily say 'Alexa stop!' and the alarm fades away, then I listen to the weather and get a flash briefing on what's new in the news while I get ready for work, maybe ask her to play a song to pep me up. Then at night I ask her to turn the lights on (though I've noticed a bit of lag from the Magic Home lighbulb, not Echo's fault, it happens with Magic Home Android app too) and am planning on getting another BT lightbulb for my overhead room-light-fixture.

Shouldn't have to choose from the three offered.

So if you're doing something that involves going from room to room, you're out of luck.Checking for and updating the firmware should be one of the voice commands the Echo recognizes.

In practice, it is mostly a mechanism to encourage further Amazon purchases. I now view Alexa as a surly teenager with a shopping problem. Alexa does not understand half of what I say, and most of the time I cannot get the apps to work.Alexa will often say "" I don't understand that question.""  Alexa will often suggest that you buy something. Let's be honest. Alexa is not designed to be a community service by Amazon. I get it, but there needs to be more functionality added  before this is a must-have item for the home. On the positive side, Alexa will pair with your Bluetooth device. It took me four or five tries, but now I can stream music from another device through Alexa.Also, I found customer service for Alexa to be sorely lacking.There is a lot of potential here, but it has not arrived yet.",0.714285714285714,"positive"

4,"Numidian","October 25, 2016","I recently bought a full sized Echo and liked it, but I have a bluetooth enabled receiver and in-ceiling wired speakers so I didn't need the speaker. Naturally, I jumped at the new Echo Dot. Overall, the experience is great - but it does have a few strengths and weaknesses worth mentioning. Below I will only discuss things directly related to the Dot as the Echo's features, strengths and weaknesses have been discussed ad nauseam.PROS:-Small: this thing is literally the size of a hockey puck. It is way less obtrusive than the the original Echo and doesn't seem like just another hunk of plastic.-Bluetooth connectivity: I was skeptical about the bluetooth here because I always seem to have problems getting headphones and speakers to reliability connect to devices via bluetooth. The Echo Dot was super easy to pair with my Sony Receiver (https://www.amazon.com/Sony-STR-DN840-Channel-1050-Watt-Receiver/dp/B00CAAQHBE). All I have to say is ""Alexa, connect to bluetooth speaker"" and my receiver wakes up, connects to the Echo and starts playing music - or whatever is coming from the Echo. So far I have been able to connect this way with 100% reliability.-Feature to price ratio: the Dot is 62% less than the original Echo and has all the features minus the bigger speaker. If you have your own bluetooth speaker or receiver, this is a non-issue. This is also a no-brainer purchase if you want an echo.CONS:-Microphones: we have noticed that the Echo Dot doesn't hear our commands as often or as well compared the original Echo. We sometimes have to shout our commands to the Echo after it seems to have ignored us at a regular volume. Some of this may be that the Dot has a harder time isolating our voices from the noise of the external speakers. We have also noticed that Echo doesn't seem to understand what we tell it with more frequency than the original Echo.-Random responses: occasionally we noticed that the Dot will respond completely out of the blue to something. It doesn't have anything to do with what we are saying - I am not sure if it's picking something up from our speakers or what. It is just a bit creepy when it suddenly pops in with a random statement.-Bluetooth limits: though I mentioned the bluetooth connectivity is excellent, it is worth noting that only one device can be connected at a time (not a big deal and a limit for all bluetooth devises) but the interesting thing I didn't think about is you can't transmit, let's say a podcast, to the Echo via bluetooth from another device and have it play that podcast to your bluetooth speakers. Thus, the Echo Dot can only play content directly from the internet when connected to bluetooth speakers. Again, this is a limit with any bluetooth device, but it is something I hadn't thought about until I wanted to play something from my iPhone on the speakers - just had to connect directly to my receiver in that case.",0.5,"netural"

5,"Norbert H. Davis","November 25, 2016","I recently purchased an Amazon Echo Dot along with the ecobee3 wi-fi thermostat.  I was pleased with the Echo Dot and the abilities of Alexa.  While I have only had it for about 3 weeks our family has fallen in love with it.  We ask Alexa for out news, weather, and to tell us some jokes.  We also started having Alexa play us some Christmas music to get us in the Christmas spirit.The Echo Dot was easy to setup with the house wifi and getting ""skills"" installed was simple.We are adding more ""smart"" devices like electrical plugs and switches to take advantage of the voice control and flexibility that ha smart home provides.  The Echo Dot is small and unassuming as it does not take up a lot of space which makes it perfect for any home environment.  I plan on getting more of the Echo Dots as they are convenient and fun to use.I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking to make their home a ""smart"" home.",0.928571428571429,"positive"
3,"Cade Lusk","January 31, 2017","While I don't use this product as often as I'd like, I'm really impressed with the Echo Dot. It does what its advertised as doing, and its a really inexpensive alternative to the most popular in home AI. However, there are some serious areas that need improving for me to be using this everyday like I imagined.The sound is a lot clearer and louder than I would have expected from the Dot. While I don't own the original Echo, I do own several speakers of similar size that cost double what the dot costs, and the sound is greater than half of the quality. Not a whole lot of graininess or anything particularly bad to speak of. Now, you're not going to get surround sound quality out of it, but it gets the job done.Setup was a breeze. The included instructions could be followed by a child, and the whole process took about ten minutes. The hardest thing was connecting to my WiFi, and even that was just a matter of downloading the app.Functionally, this product is everything you'd expect. Its a responsive AI that answers questions and interacts with (some) other apps to do cool things like turn on the lights or play your favorite news. One thing to mention here is that Alexa (I had to change the wake-word to ""echo"", Alexa is a family member's name) will just search for universal sources to do these things unless you specify otherwise (looking at TuneIn for news radio, Amazon Music for all music requests, etc). Sometimes that can be a pain, but most of the time its right on.The ""Skills"" store is pretty flush with cool skills to ""teach"" Alexa. While I understand that there is a lot of integration with the rest of the tech community, I was a little disappointed to not see more integration with the apps I have on my (android) phone. That's always been a little bit of a short-coming with Amazon though, because they always seem to truly be the less popular Third Party in the app space.There were a couple of things that I wish someone had thought to include in this generation.First, you cannot control your dot through separate accounts. For example, me and my Fiance share the device at home, but we don't have just one account for the house. She has to sign in under my name in order to use the app to change settings or add skills.Second, its really, really, REALLY inconvenient that this unit has to ALWAYS be plugged in. I understand there are some battery attachments that you can buy... but seriously. This seems like a wrong move from Amazon. The small size insinuates an ease of movement. If I go from my kitchen to my bathroom, I just want to continue hearing whatever I was listening to. Maybe I want to move the unit into the bedroom without killing the power. Either way, this seems like step back in time to an era where everything electronic needed to have disposable batteries or had to be plugged in.Last, the voice recognition over its own volume. The Echo is advertised as having many directional microphones that are supposed to make it able to hear you from any direction and over noise. However, my experience has been mixed. If I need to communicate with the Echo while its playing, say, the news - I have to SHOUT over it to get my message across. To top that, there's a microphone ""remote"" you can buy for it but no in app functionality for the microphone I carry everywhere - my phone. Again, you can't control this thing via voice commands from your phone. Huge oversight that's probably intentional to get you to buy the remote.This is a great little gadget that has a TON of potential. I still love using mine when I do, and I think it will be a lot nicer once I get my Smart Home setup going. However, there are still a lot of areas of improvement that I really don't see as being all that difficult to implement. 3/5, I would recommend, just not strongly at this point.",0.722222222222222,"positive"
5,"Mister Gizmo","October 28, 2016","I was just learning to live with my disappointment over an LG ""smart"" TV I'd bought recently that is anything but smart. In addition, it has the worst user interface I've seen since the 1980s. Fortunately, Amazon has brought out a device that works, works well, and is very intuitive. It was a little bit of a problem setting up, because the instructions are so limited, but once over that small hump, it's been fine. I'm surprised at how well it understands commands, even with so-far limited exposure to my voice to learn from.If there's a frustration, it's mainly that the Dot (and Alexa devices in general) have a lot more potential than what's available right now. As with any new device, it takes a while for third parties to figure out what capabilities are possible, and then to spend the time and effort developing them. As just one example, I could see the Dot acting as an intercom, even a rudimentary telephone to connect Dot/Alexa users. I'm thinking particularly of elderly or handicapped people who'd like something that only requires voice commands. But I'm willing to wait. And since most of the heavy lifting happens in the cloud, the Dot's hardware should be good for a few years.Now if Amazon would only invest a little more time to bring its Kindle browser, which has been in beta for years and years, into something that actually works. You can do it, Amazon! The Dot shows that you can be great at software if you really try. :-)Update: I did experience one wrinkle when buying a Dot for a friend. It arrived pre-registered to me. Trying to use the normal setup for the new user didn't work. I finally realized that I had to de-register it from my account, sign out of the Alexa app (and reset the Dot), then sign in as a new registrant. This is explained in Alexa help, but it wasn't obvious at first. I don't know if it's the case, but if you buy it as a ""gift"" in the purchasing process, it ""may"" arrive unregistered, which would be good. I suspect Amazon ships them registered to streamline the setup by eliminating a couple of steps.",0.642857142857143,"positive"
5,"Brian S","February 27, 2017","Love it. As soon as these came out I bought one. I didn't need the nice speaker of the Echo, i just use it mostly for home automation. Ties into Samsung's Smartthings nicely.What surprises me the most is that more often that not it understands my 3 year old son. This is both amazing and annoying as he loves to say (in a very muttled toddler voice), ""Alexa, turn off all the lights"". To which Alexa will reply (80% of the time), ""OK"". Every light in my house goes off... I'm not pointing this out as a negative, its quite remarkable she understands him correctly 80% of the time. The other 20% she can't understand him, but who can blame her, I can barley understand him sometimes.We also love using this as a cooking timer, but even more so as countdown timer for bath time. It helps my son cope with playtime being over, he will even set her timer for me.The Alexa platform is growing fast. Some things I hope to see soon:  -Text readouts and replies (for multiple people, e.g. ""Alexa send message to Brian from jessica's phone"", even better perhaps someday she will distinguish 1 voice from another, using this as a security measure so only I can send messages from phone)  -Calendar Events  -API integration that will allow Alex to alert you to items (e.g. ""your front has been open for over 5 minutes"", or ""Someone just rang your doorbell"")",0.75,"positive"

When I spoke the wake name ""Alexa,"" the blue ring would appear, but after I gave the command, nothing happened. I performed the setup once again, but even then Alexa was lost. I couldn't find any tutorials on this problem. However, by the next day, Alexa had found its way and everything was back to normal. I did have to initiate contact between my Smart devices and Echo, since I had essentially rebooted the system.

5,"Josh Carter","November 28, 2016","My biggest question before buying the Dot was whether the volume was too low to use by itself, but the volume of this device is certainly substantial enough to not need an external speaker, especially if it's being used in a location where music isn't one of the top uses. I have the full-size Echo in my kitchen/downstairs area and it fills the first floor with music most of the time. The Dot is in my bedroom and is used more for information & smart home use, but is great for the morning news briefings and occasionally playing music in the mornings while getting ready for the day.",1,"positive"

After all the research, I came to the conclusion that the only difference between this and the regular sized echo is the sound quality. The regular Amazon Echo gets better and louder sound. I look forward to purchasing it soon. My kids and I have had fun with it telling jokes. I would say that about 75% of the jokes are actually pretty funny and make me laugh. If you ask Alexa why she sucks she has a funny response in saying that maybe she thought she was a vacuum cleaner. We use it for Music, mainly Pandora, weather, jokes, etc. I'm getting ready to dig deeper and see what else is possible.",0.714285714285714,"positive"
4,"batonrouge","November 10, 2016","Honestly I still use my echo more than this one.  But that is mainly due to the location of both units.

And if you don't say the trigger phrase just right you are just waiting your breath and look like a idiot in front of others yelling at it and either it not hear you or it performs something other than what your telling it.But I do believe that this is only the beginning of great things to come. It broke a barrier and is just the beginning of a new trend in technology.And because of the price, I rated it 4 stars rather than 3.I will say that im glad I didn't buy one for each room.

5,"Amazon Customer","December 13, 2016","I purchased this as a replacement for an IVR clock called ""Moshi"". Moshi's Interactive Voice Recognition (IVR) was contained in the clock and was not trainable. The Echo Dot cost the same as the clock. The Echo Dot's ""Alexa"" IVR program has many features that make it superior. First, the IVR itself is trainable and vastly superior to the clock. She correctly understands almost everything I say. This is because Alexa lives in the Amazon Cloud, and is connected via Wi-Fi. She picks up the correct Time & Date from the network so you never have to set any of those things. She will also read you the current news and weather. You will need a smartphone to use Echo Dot. The phone must be connected to Wi-Fi and then the Alexa app must be installed and run. You must have an Amazon account. Alexa will also play music, and will evolve over time as new functionality is added. I should note that Alexa is an IVR program, NOT an AI.",0.8,"positive"

One of my favorite features is that you have to use your brain to make Alexa say something fun- ask her for an Easter egg.I only have two criticism: one, with Apples Siri, if she misunderstood what you said you can correct that. In the Alexa app, you can only select if she heard you right- not what you really said. I would like that feature to be added. Secondly, Alexa should be able to hear you from further away. Apparently there is a far-field voice regognition feature but it only seems to works about half the time.

Most of the time she talks we weren't even talking.  Maybe we aren't maximizing her features but other than getting the weather report or the headline news I haven't seen too much value.  We did buy the light kits that work with Alexa but the brand just couldn't keep connected to our internet so we had to return them.  When they were working we found the light feature handy, but when Alexia isn't connected to anything, she's just another gadget I don't need on my counter.

When you first plug it in you have to get the app for your phone, and install the updates on your phone to set up the Alexa to your prime account. You have the option to set your account up to the Alexa to purchase products, I did not for security reasons(not sure how protected the Alexa is with being hacked and all) and also don't want my daughter ordering toys when I'm not around! If you ask Alexa something she can't give you answer over the Dot, she sends you the information to your app. Also the only thing I would change is to integrate a calendar (if you can I haven't figured it out yet,owned it for 5 days), instead of a to do list.

With the Dot I can just leave it on the shelf, connect it to my blutooth speaker, and move the speaker as needed. We have an open floor plan, so most of the time we don't have to move the speaker, but if we are in the kitchen we sometimes can not hear the music as well, so we just move the speaker now.I am still learning about all of the things the Dot can do, and it is fun to find these things.",0.875,"positive"

I like both those models for different reasons, though the only real reason to purchase a Tap is the portability.  Otherwise, go with the Echo.  So since I had a Tap, but wanted the Echo features, I bought an Echo Dot.  This is where you might end up in a conundrum.  I want more sound, and the Dot does not provide much.

I primarily use it as voice control for a dedicated theater, so I've integrated it with my Logitech Harmony Remote and Home Hub, Philips Hue lights, Samsung SmartThings Hub, etc., and it all works perfectly together. The other functionality, like the alarm clock, timer, search engine, etc. is all more of a novelty to me, but it's still great to have, and it entertains the hell out of my 4-year-old son. For the price, this is one of the best purchases I've made in years, and it's very quickly become indispensable in my house. I wish there was a way to make it only listen/respond to my voice, as I don't want anyone else playing with my theater setup, but hopefully unique voice recognition (and added security features) will come with later models. For the time being, that one extremely minor shortcoming is easily overlooked by everything else it provides.",0.785714285714286,"positive"

TP smartplug works great with its Kasa app. But to be able to tell Alexa to turn off lights etc, Alexa needs to enable Kasa within the Alexa app, WHICH SHE SIMPLY WILL NOT DO for me, and from reading reviews, for other people as well. Alexa app reads ""Unable to link, try again later"" and there's no troubleshooting for that from any source, Alexa or Kasa. The Help-Support links within Alexa app are disabled so I'm left scrolling through reviews looking for advice. Followed every step so it's odd it's not linking. The smartplug integration option was a key point for me so unless this feature works with the Dot, half the appeal of the device is gone. Just know that this may happen to you if you're considering buying the bundle. Amazon, please add some Alexa troubleshooting support for this type of issue.",0.692307692307692,"positive"

It does its job though it works in the bedroom while alexa is in the living room.It still has the same features, home automation, Pandora, shopping list, weathers etc.... the only problem for me is just the speaker quality. If you want it not for music just for the other features this is the perfect unit especially for the price !If you are like me and do not have a sound system to connect the dot to then using this for music even in a small space may not be the best option just due to the lack of quality especially compared to the echo.Would I purchase another one, probably not but would I recommend it  to someone looking for an amazon echo but does not want to spend the money 100% yes.",0.5,"netural"

It'll say it's connected, and it'll play audio from a speaker, but the audio cuts in and out about every second--it's NOT playing much more than it IS playing.  I confirmed it was the Echo Dot device because I moved the Dot right next to the speaker, and I also tried it with another bluetooth speaker in another room.  Both situations led to the same problem--horribly intermittent bluetooth connectivity.  My phone could connect and play audio with no problems for both speakers.  There were no changes in our home in terms of RF-emitting devices--the Dot just stopped working one day.  Looks like I'll have to connect with the audio cable permanently.

So if I connect to my receiver to listen to music, then ask Alexa what the weather is, I can hardly hear her response. I tried to set it back to use the internal speaker, but couldn't figure out how to do that. I ended up unplugging it from the stereo, and now i can hear it from the internal speaker.

The purpose is to keep track of whether ""Alexa"" accurately answered your request.  There were cards for things I knew I had never asked for.  Playing the request is how I foiund out that my nephew was asking for music, when I was away from home, that I wouldn't let him play while around.  HA!  You should have seen his eyes, too funny.

2,"Jamie Lyn","February 27, 2017","Bought this for my bedroom to control my lights and play music. Glad I have the original Amazon Echo for the main part of my house. The dot is definitely not a substitute for the original Amazon Echo but rather a mediocre addition to it. The sound quality isn't as good but I expected that considering the size of the dot. So I just have it hooked up to my bedroom surround sound and let my good quality speakers do all the heavy lifting. The dot is very handy for controlling my lights after I've gotten into bed and am ready to sleep. However, at least once a week the dot will respond to one of my commands telling me that there is a problem with the connection and that it will need to be reset. Don't have a problem connecting any of my other devices in my bedroom and my original Amazon Echo has never failed me like this. So what the heck dot? It also defies me on a regular basis. I'll ask it to turn off the nightstand lights and it will only turn off one. Or I'll ask it to turn off my dresser light and it will turn on my nightstand lights. Super frustrating. It makes mistakes like this on a regular basis whereas my original Amazon Echo doesn't. If you love your original Amazon Echo and are thinking of getting a second but are feeling cheap...don't cheap out like I did. Just buy another original.

Unfortunately, it doesn't yet have that capability; the app for it is being developed by SONOS, so no fault of the Dot.  Their SONOS receiver does not have an audio input, so it can't play from the Dot, again, no fault of the Dot.However, there is one fairly serious flaw, it's the Alexa App.  It freezes constantly on several devices, and often won't open at all.  I've been trying for 3 days, reinstalled the app on several devices, but it just doesn't work.  That's a big deal.Also, setting it up with 3rd party devices is spotty.  I have a TP-Link Smart Plug, and Alexa just doesn't see it, even with the proper app installed.

But, I knew that going in and had such expectations...and was pleasantly surprised!  I use mine in my formal living/dining room and the sound is great for as small as the unit is.  You can also 1/4 inch plug into your house speakers/etc to get improved quality and volume.  All Alexa features like my lights and temp control work like a champ through it.  Very happy with the purchase and highly recommend it!",1,"positive"

It's small size makes it great for a beside table or other area where the full-size is too large.The main difference, other than size, is music quality is a bit less than big Echo. It still sounds good; but if you want fuller sound, watch for a sale, and get yourself a good Bluetooth speaker. I have paired a smart plug with it so I can voice-control a bedroom lamp. Small package, great results. If you want Echo benefits, but the budget is tight, you can't go wrong with the Dot.",0.875,"positive"

3,"Amazon Customer","December 16, 2016","Never tried Alexa when it came out, but after 2 years I believe we still have lots of limitations of the things that we can do ( of what it is expected from this type of devices). For locations info Only works in the US, no  interface with google maps or waze. Outside the US works fine for other things. You can't send SMS with other carriers rather than AT&T. It doesn't have interface with Netflix or youtube ( with chromecast or amazon fire stick or tv ). It doesn't give you price of items unless you set up order over alexa.  For a new type of device it is a beginning and it needs lots of work. I hope amazon keep investing on the new things it can do. I bought 2 of these devices, one for my house and one for the office.

5,"Tech Guy from IL","November 26, 2016","This is really an amazing gadget and I'm finding a lot of good uses for mine. In the bedroom it is handy because you can ask Alexa the time or the weather at any time of the night without having to get out of bed or turn on a light. It also plays a wide variety of music. I use it to stream classical music from my favorite classical station. The sound is actually pretty good (in mono) right out of the disc if you are listening at low levels in a quiet room or at your desk at the office. Plug in a good pair of headphones and you'll get great sound in stereo. Sometimes I connect it to my stereo system and listen that way. With the dearth of good programming on local radio these days, having the ability to pick up stations from other areas on the Internet is really nice. This might be the best sounding and easiest to use Internet radio currently available, especially for the price. No complicated user interface to deal with.

That worked great, the way you can tell Alexa to connect/disconnect to/from bluetooth is awesome.  Even so, I later realized that the FireTV would actually be a better solution for streaming music, and has the added bonus of Prime Video capability.  So I bought the new FireTV stick for those tasks and now we use the Echo Dot mostly for asking about the weather forecast and keeping a shared shopping list.  The shopping list feature is incredibly useful - you can link multiple amazon accounts/alexa apps to the same list so that when you add something to the list it also shows up on your partners' apps.  No more texting back and forth about what is needed at the grocery store.I will say that as of early 2017, Alexa is nowhere near as smart as Siri.  However, the microphone and speech recognition technology is incredible.  You can ask a question from three rooms away and Alexa hears and parses it just fine every time.

No more pen and paper!  Alexa is full of facts and will even tell you a joke if you want.  The price was great and as we have wireless speakers already, I didn't feel I needed to spend the extra money for the Echo as that was the only difference.  This was easy to get up and running.  It also works with our Phillips Hue light strip and Go light.  Alexa is able to turn them off and on.  There are a lot of capabilities such as getting daily news, music, weather and facts. If Alexa doesn't know an answer you can ask her to search Bing.  If you have Amazon Prime you can order items from Amazon.

I had to repair it to the wifi router- not as smart as google assistant for general questions.

It is very good at answering simple questions but struggles with more complicated questions. For its price it is worth it just for the list of hidden funny responses you can get for asking it silly questions.  For a good list of fun things to ask Alexa search the internet for ""Alexa Easter Eggs"". My personal favorite is what she sings if you ask her to sing you a love song. Its smart home integration is really nice although some of the commands are a little verbose and take longer than I would like I say.  For example its integration with the Logitech Harmony Hub works great except the commands are very long.  To get Alexa to pause your DVR the full command of ""Alexa, tell Harmony to to pause TV"". While that doesn't seem like a long statement a command like ""Alexa, Harmony, Pause"" would be a lot better.  Overall I love my Echo Dot. I currently have one in the living room and one in the master bedroom.  I plan to add one to my basement theater room and another one in the room where my 8 month old twins sleep.Pros:Setup is very easyIntegrates with just about any smart home hardwareLots of fun apps and the list is growingPretty good speaker for size and priceCons:No battery so it must be plugged in.

However, it cannot search the web for answers, or at least not very competently. The one I have is pretty glitchy (it is NOT my internet since I have 1 gig fiber). When giving replies it regularly pauses mid answer, or I only get a blip for an answer. I would probably not have bought this item except I got it on black Friday for a great deal. I would not recommend this for anyone who wants something like Siri.",1,"positive"

Its an alarm, a timer, It will play music through its tiny little speaker, its gives you basic weather info, a dictionary, an encyclopedia, a calendar... etc. but definately not smart (yet?) Ok, she's dumb as a box of rocks.  Its not like asking google something..  My phone does everything Echo wants to do.. I do however enjoy the hands off element, the alarm and the NPR News Flash Briefing.... It was easy to set up, just follow the directions. It's tiny and can fit in the smallest space near an outlet.  I have one in my bedroom. and the other is hidden in my living room. I like it as an instant night light, an alarm, timer and basic weather and news info..You can buy pricey ""smart"" light bulbs and sockets from amazon to turn your home into a smart home. ******Just a thought, If amazon wanted to do some good. They would provid them to the vision impaired for free. They could navigate to a certain area by where the sound is coming from. The Time, Date and Temperature would be easily known. Music can be played and News reports just by asking.******",0.625,"positive"

5,"Eric H.","December 30, 2016","I was skeptical about the usefulness of Alexa, but I'm a believer now.  I first purchased an Amazon Tap for my wife because I wanted her to be able to take it with her wherever she went in the house and this was the only available portable ""Alexa"" option.  I quickly learned two things.  First was that Alexa is really cool and quite useful.  Second is that having to tap a button to wake up Alexa is annoying.  I immediately wanted to make a move to an ""always on"" Alexa device.  This left me with two choices, the Echo and the Dot.  The Echo is the easy choice, but it didn't make sense to me to get the Echo because it is basically a Dot with a nice built in speaker.  For the price difference between the two, I could get the Dot and pair it with a great quality Bluetooth (or wired) speaker.  It just gives you a lot more options, including being able to wire it directly into a home stereo system.Configuring:The Dot is extremely easy to set up through the Alexa app on your phone.  You can be up and running within a couple minutes after you go through the simple set up program and get it connected to your WiFi.  The Echo, after configuring and connecting to WiFi, runs entirely in the Amazon cloud.  This means that it does not run through your phone, but rather runs off internet based programming and only needs to be connected to WiFi.  Your phone is only used to give access to certain cloud based programs and ""skills"".  After that, it runs independently, but may send info back to your phone.  Overall, it is very easy and intuitive.Usefulness:I seem to find new uses for the Dot every day.  Like most people, my primary use is for music.  I have it connected to Amazon Music, Pandora, Spotify, iHeart Radio and TuneIn.  You can be very vague and just ask for a genre of music or you can ask for a specific title via a specific music service.  I listen to a wide variety of music and whether it is rock, metal, rap, country, jazz or classical I have always been able to find what I wanted to listen to with Alexa.Outside of music, I use Alexa to control my thermostat, turn lights on/off, lock the door, check weather, check calendar, get news updates, sports scores, order pizza and even play some fun interactive games with Alexa.  Amazon offers a huge variety of ""skills"" that can be enabled on your Dot and that list continues to grow as more companies offer these interactive options which are similar to apps for your smartphone.Ease of use:One Dot can cover a large size room for voice recognition pretty well.  The only time that I have had an issue is when it is placed too close to the speaker and it is trying to hear me over the music.  I have purchased multiple units and have them throughout the house.  I also have one that I put in my office at work. I'm constantly amazed at how accurate it is at understanding what I am saying.  It very rarely has trouble understanding me.Conclusion:It is hard for me to imagine not having this very useful item around now that I have become accustomed to it.  It is one of the most useful things that you never knew you needed.  Of all of the Alexa options, I would pick the Echo Dot based solely on its versatility and low price point.  It has all of the functionality of the full size Echo and you can pair it with a high quality Bluetooth or wired speaker system for better results than you can get with the Echo alone.  I would and have bought this product again.",0.733333333333333,"positive"

Alexa has even stopped saying 'Hmmm...I don't know the answer to that' and just gives me this stupid 'ding...and nothin.'  I asked her today - ""Is there a snow delay for the Philadelphia School District today'...and got the very annoying 'Hmmm...I can't find the answer' response from her.  I tried it multiple way, and nothing worked.  Since I couldn't get Alexa to tell me if my son's school was closed or delayed due to snow, I had to find my laptop and look it up.

5,"Matt Schroeder","February 10, 2017","Amazon Echo Dot 2nd GenerationThanks for taking time to read this review. I received the 2nd Generation Amazon Echo Dot for a Christmas present. I had been searching for a small speaker that I could use for my bedroom, and the Echo Dot seemed perfect. My roommate owns the 1st Generation Standard Echo, but I didn't need the sound capabilities that that model provides. I didn't like the idea of having to tap the speaker every time I used it, so I ruled out the Echo Tap. This led me to the Echo Dot. I could not be happier with my decision. The Echo Dot is easily the best speaker I have ever owned.SetupI immediately wanted to set up the speaker after unwrapping it because I was so excited to use it. In the box with the speaker comes a small piece of paper that tells you to download the Alexa app onto a phone or tablet (If you don't have a smartphone or tablet, you can certainly use someone else's phone to do this, as setup is just a one-time thing). The first step that the Alexa app will guide you through is connecting your Echo to a Wi-Fi network. If you don't have Wi-Fi, the speaker's features will be limited to Bluetooth connections from other devices. Next, the Echo will have you train it to recognize your voice by asking you to say a few phrases to it. Finally, you will have to connect your Echo to an Amazon account. Amazon accounts are free and easy to set up, and you don't need to have a Prime account to use your Echo. Getting my Echo Dot ready to use took less than five minutes. The quick setup is one of the things I was happiest about with this product.AlexaThe ""Alexa"" feature is probably the coolest feature of the Echo. If you're unfamiliar with Alexa, she is the imaginary robot inside your Echo that you can direct commands towards. For example, if you say, ""Alexa, play Africa by Toto,"" the speaker will play Africa by Toto from the Amazon Prime music library (only if you have Amazon Prime; I'll talk about this more later in the review). The Echo has the best voice recognition out of any product I have ever used. Alexa will hear your command from nearly everywhere in your house. On more than one occasion, my Echo in my bedroom has picked up commands that I have told my roommate's Echo downstairs, and I will often times come upstairs to the same music playing on my Echo that I was just listening to on my roommate's. The only voice recognition issues the Echo Dot has is when I have  water running while doing dishes. Otherwise, she always recognizes my commands.SoundThe Echo Dot puts out an impressive sound for its small size. The ideal setting for the Echo Dot is any room with less than five people talking. I have even used my Echo Dot on my front porch, and I have no problems with the clarity of the music. The Echo Dot has up and down buttons to control the volume, but you can also say ""Alexa, volume 5,"" or ""Alexa, volume up"" to change the volume. To add to the Echo Dot's versatility, Amazon included an auxiliary out port. This allows you to play music on a louder speaker through the Echo Dot. The Alexa feature still works, but instead of the built-in speaker, the Echo Dot outputs the sound through your larger speaker.CapabilitiesIn order to be able to simply say, ""Alexa, play (song title),"" you need to be an Amazon Prime subscriber. Subscribing to Amazon Prime gives you access to Amazon's enormous music library, and Alexa can play any of those songs with a simple command. Thankfully, Amazon was generous enough to allow the Echo Dot to be synced with a variety of different music apps. I have the speaker synced with my Spotify account, so I can say ""Alexa, play (song title) by (artist) on Spotify,"" and she can play any song in Spotify's library. She can even play my playlists and playlists I subscribe to on Spotify. Some other music apps that are supported by the Echo are Pandora, TuneIn, and IHeartRadio.AccessoriesIncluded with the Echo Dot is the power cord to connect the speaker to the wall. Without it, the Echo will not work. Thankfully, the power cable is a Micro USB cable, which is the same as most phone chargers besides the iPhone. The power cord is 5 feet long, which is convenient. Amazon also offers some stylish cases to cover your Echo Dot and give it some color. The cases are sold on Amazon.com and are $14.99.Ideal UserIn my mind, the Echo is great for anyone with a Wi-Fi connection and a mild liking for music who wants to be able to fill a small room with sound. Because of the ease of setup and use, there isn't an age range for this product in my mind. I wouldn't even say the ideal user needs to have a Spotify or Amazon Prime subscription because of the number of free apps that are compatible with the speaker.In conclusion, you will not find a speaker that matches the quality of the Echo Dot anywhere near this price.",0.833333333333333,"positive"
4,"Rich Cobb","February 22, 2017","I bought the Dot with a single purpose in mind: voice control for my home automation system. There are many other reviews discussing Dot’s other features, but here I want to share my experience with voice control. I do use my Dot to get weather and flash briefings, amuse myself with Alexa’s jokes, and (occasionally) try new “skills”. Alexa and Dot make a mostly fine home automation control experience, with a few caveats. Here’s the scoop!Before I decided to try Dot I was looking for another scene controller to use in my living room. I have a Vera Plus home automation (HA) controller and large number of Leviton Vizia RF switches and dimmers around my home; there are eight devices in my living room alone, along with a Leviton wall mounted scene controller. I have scenes for reading, watching TV, early morning (dim lighting), cleaning, and so forth. In the living room it is tedious to get up to use the wall controller every time I want to make a change. In my bedroom, I use a MiniMote (a very small, 4-Button, handheld remote control made by Aeon Labs), which I keep on my nightstand. My first thought was to buy another one to use in the living room.While the MiniMote is a terrific device, I really didn’t want to have another remote to keep tabs on; it’s small and svelte, which means it would find itself under a couch cushion in less time than it takes to queue up the next episode of Veep. Voice control seemed to be the perfect answer. But cost was a concern. The MiniMote is available here on Amazon for $36.95, so competing on cost would be a challenge. I was willing to pay more for voice control (Leviton scene and zone controls are in the $100+ range), but only if it worked. When I stumbled onto the Dot, I realized that if it worked I might never need a handheld or wall mounted controller. And any other benefits of Alexa would be free extras.So how well does it work? I’m very satisfied and it is absolutely better that a handheld remote. Dot sits inconspicuously on a side table near the front of the living room. I can set a scene for reading with “Alexa, turn on Reading”, which turns on the floor lamp, sets the pendant lights over the couch to 40%, the coffee bar lights to 20%, and turns off the media center and fireplace lighting.As to the caveats:-My experience has been that most of the time Alexa will flawlessly understand and execute my commands. If there is background noise it occasionally won’t work, for example when watching TV.-Occasionally Alexa simply misunderstands my annunciation, which I attribute to my occasionally sloppy New England accent. Repeating the command clearly nearly always works the second time.-Configuration and setup (at least with Vera) is crucial to getting the results you want. Naming your devices simply is the best approach. Even with my large number of switches and dimmers this wasn’t too challenging, however I don’t try to control every device from the living room.-The protocol for scenes is “Alexa, turn on [scene name]”.  If you have a scene that turns off devices you will still say “Alexa, turn on [scene name]”.-You must avoid using the words “On” or “Off” in your scene names. Alexa confuses the On and Off actions with the name of an action.-The protocol for turning on or off a specific device is “Alexa, Turn [On or Off] [room name] [device name]”. For example, “Alexa, Turn On Living Room Floor Lamps” or “Alexa, Set Living Room Coffee Bar Lights to 40 percent”-Occasionally Alexa responds to my scene command that “some devices did not respond” even though things worked as expected. I not sure why this happens, probably Vera is too slow to respond through the various cloud interfaces.Wish list:One feature I really feel needs to be implemented is the ability to secure Dot access. I would use them in more places, however I’m not comfortable with having everyone in the house be able to trigger things.Bottom line:I’m glad I tried the Alexa interface to my Vera and I’d easily recommend it to anyone. The convenience of hands-free access to my HA devices is worth those infrequent misses.",0.702702702702703,"positive"
2,"Tex S.","January 8, 2017","The concept of Echo is cool. A computer assistant that's always listening and connected into the Amazon mothership. I have a Tap and it's great because I can use it as a portable wifi or bluetooth speaker, but have to tap the button to activate Alexa. I thought I was missing out by not having an Echo that listened all the time. I was wrong, I'm not missing much of anything.Before I get to the bad, what can Alexa do that is good?She can give me weather forecasts and current conditions and they're accurate.She can give me good deals exclusive to Alexa.She can tell me where my Amazon stuff is.She has a limited database of jokes, some of which are pretty funny.She can add stuff to my cart for me to finalize and order later, she adds several things to choose from based on what you tell her and it's fairly accurate most of the time.That about wraps up what Alexa can do for me.""Woah,"" you might say, ""she can do so much more!"" Can she?""Alexa order a dust pan""""Amazon doesn't have the last desk fan you ordered, but here is a Lasko [...] for $37 dollars. Is this what you want?""""Alexa stop.

It always pirated what I said and played Amazon's station which is terrible.So, what Alexa can do for me is extremely limited. And what she can do is frankly easier many times to just open the app on the phone and do it myself.I tried to use Alexa to order things on Amazon as I think of them. If I tell her to just add it to my cart from the beginning, it works out pretty well. However if I don't understand her run on sentences as she describes the item in a much quicker dialogue with a very computerized voice with no inflections than she usually talks in - and I want her to simply add it to the cart so I can review it, she can't. I have to cancel it and re tell her to add it to the cart, and by then I could have done it from my phone.So Alexa is a cool concept but it's not there yet. She's definitely not artificially intelligent in any definition of the word, and it's usually faster to do her limited actions on your phone. I'll try again in a year or two unless Google or Apple end up having a better solution.",0.594594594594595,"positive"
4,"Steven M","February 24, 2017","I bought the Echo Dot after some persuasion by friends who'd been given Dots as gifts. I was a bit apprehensive, because I've come to know other AI services quite well (Apple's Siri being the best example) and none of them have been wholly impressive. They all lack some sort of ability, whether that is cross-app support or the ability to use services that aren't native to the platform. Apple's Siri, for example, is still very limited in its ability to control and use third-party apps such as WhatsApp and Skype.Echo Dot is an entirely different product altogether. It uses Amazon's own AI, Alexa, for its commands. Whether you spring for the full-blown Echo or this Echo Dot, you get the same access to the service. The main differences between this and the full Echo are the size and the price. The Dot can be had for $50, whereas the Echo tower retails at $179. I haven't had the chance to try out the tower, but I've heard nothing different about it compared to Echo. The only operational difference is that Dot is the only Echo device with a 3.5mm jack output, which enables you to connect it to external speakers. The tower requires a Bluetooth speaker connection.Overall, I am impressed with Echo Dot. It is a very powerful device, and for the price, it cannot be beat. The form factor is small as well, so small that I have mine on my already-crowded bedside table. It takes up just about as much space as a coffee mug.As far as its capabilities, there are some things that are worth noting. As of yet, there is no connection between Echo and any Apple products. I carry an iPhone, and my work is split between two iPads and Mac computers. All of my calendar information is in iCloud, which Amazon Echo cannot access. It would be nice in the future for Echo to read my daily schedule from iCloud, but that support is not currently present. It can read from Google, though, so those with Google Calendars or Android devices should be just fine. It won't be able to play media in your iTunes Library (although it can play from your Amazon library). This isn't a huge thing for me, but having a device which could read from iCloud would be a huge help to me.In terms of daily usability aside from that, Echo definitely beats the competition. Through the Alexa mobile app (which you must download in order to set up your Echo), you can install ""skills"" which enable things such as daily news briefings or stock updates. They are all, to my knowledge, free to download. Even with none of these skills enabled, Echo is still an amazing device. I use my Alexa as an alarm clock every morning.A bit more about skills. While the skill packages themselves are free to download and install, some require subscriptions to additional services. A few examples would be music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora. Much like on a PC or a mobile device, both of these offer free music streaming. To enable the premium subset of features, both require a subscription. This is no different on Alexa - once you teach Alexa your account information, she will play your music. Both Spotify and Pandora offer premium subscriptions, though. And both are optional for PC as well as Alexa. For Pandora, paying will enable you to skip tracks more often and listen ad-free. On Spotify, free users aren't able to pick tracks individually. I subscribe to both premium services, so I can tell Alexa to play virtually any song from Spotify on-demand and she will. This will also work with Amazon Music, which is free and unlimited only to Amazon Prime customers. So, in essence, there are no additional fees REQUIRED to use the Echo. The only advantage of doing so would be to enable the subsciption-specific subset of privileges for a certain service.Overall, I am very impressed with Echo Dot. It's an amazingly powerful device, and with new skills hitting the app almost every week, the only thing hampering the growth of its abilities is time. I will be a repeat buyer.",0.84375,"positive"
5,"Dylan Piekarski","January 4, 2017","To start, I will say this is actually my second Echo Dot. My first one was a gift to me, and I move between houses, so I bought one more. And I would like to state, that it was really hard to convince me to be able to get one. Not gonna lie, the idea of having a device, let alone a little black puck with lights on it, that is always on, always listening, whether private conversation or not, is frighting. I hated the idea that there would be something that could record anything it heard in an instant, only to send it to a huge company to possibly use against you. I know that makes me sound paranoid, but its the truth. To be fair, I'm a bit of a geek. Watch a lot of movies and play a lot of games, but whatever. Long story short, I figured that if anyone wanted listen in on someone, its not hard to do. Were just in the age of technology. I also figured, I mind as well enjoy technology until it completely turns on us. Haha.OK, now that the doom and gloom is done, lets get to the awesomeness.A couple of things:Well, first, its another well made Amazon product. It's sleek. It's shiny. It just plain looks cool.Second, it can actually be really helpful. Whether you cooking or simply need to wake up, you can set a timer or alarm to your need. Need help with math homework? Simply ask and she might help. Or, do you just sit on the couch waiting for your next Amazon package to arrive? simply ask the phrase ""Alexa, wheres my package?"" and she lets you knowThird, it's really nice to be able to simply ask a question when it pops into your head and possibly get an answer.Fourth, this can either be a good thing or a bad thing, but it helps you be lazy. ""Alexa, turn on the lights"", ""Alexa whats 20 times 12?"" etc...Lets talk about the actual device for a second. It looks really good, I think. It has the usual build quality you expect from Amazon, very good. Its simple. I mean four buttons: Action/Alexa, Mic Mute, Volume Up/Down. Not to mention, one cable (if you dont need the aux).Also, it does have a speaker of its own! I was unsure as Amazon and everyone else pushes connecting it to another speaker or something for sound, but it does indeed have it own speaker. People also say that the sound quality of said speaker is poor. I disagree. Now, is it some booming, fantastic sounding speaker, no. But, it is more than adequate the asking Alexa an answer, in fact, I don't think it sound too bad at all. I play music through it and while not great, its not as bad as everyone says either. BUT, I would like to say that I have my Dot in my bedroom, where it is fairly quiet, when compared to the rest of the house. So I do agree that it will need to be paired with some other sound system for the best experience, but, I simply state that it is not a soundless puck.PerformanceI cannot give a good review, as I have not had it very long, but so far so good. She seems to hear me fine, and her actions are quick. I have had two things, mainly one I guess: 1.) Like the confuse bands easily. I asked to play The Neighborhood , but played some kids music with a tiger and, idk. She has the tendency to not always search the Amazon library, and is very picky and needy with exact names. For instance ""Alexa, play the Billie Holiday station"", ...... ""The Billie Holiday station could not be found"", ok, so I asked again, slightly more specific ""Alexa, play the Billie Holiday station on Amazon Music"",...... ""Playing Billie Holiday station on amazon music""So, that is slightly annoying. I do wish, especially for specific bands, that you could specify which band/ song you want to play for future reference. Mabey when it pops up in the Alexa app, and you say ""no, it did not do what i wanted"" you would have the option to manually select the one you want, so she knows for next time.2.) It had some internet connectivity issues. Mainly, I would be listening to a song and say ""Alexa"", then she would glow red and say sorry your echo dot is not connected, please refer to your manual, blah blah blah. But here's the thing, it was still playing music and seemed to be connected to the app, so that was weird. It only seemed to happen one more time, the same thing, only this time the app said it was disconnected, yet the Dot still played music all fine. Unplugged it, and plugged it back in, it was ok then. I would like to point out, that the internet was fine the entire time. We have fast, reliable internet. And nothing else was having issues. SO, it probably was just a fluke thing, but im going to keep my eye out.This is where I kinda run out of things to say, I haven't used it enough to say much else, but i will report back soon!",0.543859649122807,"positive"
4,"Kindle Customer","January 4, 2017","My Amazon Echo/Dot review:  Just before Christmas I decided to join the hands free digital assistant revolution.  I ordered two Dots and an Echo for my 1002 square foot condo.  They were on sale but on back order – the projected delivery date was January 14th.  Okay, they’re for me, $10 off each Dot and $40 off the Echo, no rush.  I was pleasantly surprised to receive the Dots on December 26th and the Echo today (January 4th).  Set up was super easy.  I already had the app on my phone so it took no time for the Dots.I did change the name of the Dots to Kitchen Dot and Bedroom Dot – 1st Dot and 2nd Dot were just too confusing.  It did take me a while (who knows why – short between the operator and the keyboard maybe) to find the zip code/location change screen – it’s on the settings page in the App.  About four minutes after plugging in the Echo I realized that it and the Kitchen Dot were just a smidge too close to each other, so I updated the wake word on the Echo to Echo (it sits near the TV so, that should fix Alexa commercial wake ups too).Streaming Spotify is super easy – even with my braces/lisp. Actually, I’m pretty amazed how even without doing much of the voice training, just how well the system understands me.  I speak softly, my voice is a little high, and new braces mean voicemail systems hang up on me and audio customer service menus don’t understand me at all - once running on any of the units, you can easily change radio station or playlist either vocally or via the Spotify app.  I’m not sure I’m ready to go Amazon Unlimited yet, I’ll have to play with it for a while.  I need to be able to create my own playlists and I love “radio” stations based off of a single track that introduce me to new artists.  I haven’t seen that available in Music Unlimited.  I am a little disappointed in the speaker quality of the Dot, it seems a bit tinny.  But, I connected to a better existing Bluetooth speaker in the bedroom and it’s fine.My two favorite features are really simple ones but they mean a lot: I cook.  I really like to cook.  I can ask Alexa to set a timer while my hands are full and she does it and confirms it has been set.  Oh my goodness…. Bake cookies and set the timer with the oven mitt on?  Pan/plate/pot in hand?  Love it.  The Dot in the kitchen is loud enough I can hear the timer in the living room over the dishwasher and the TV.  The other is the ability to add items to a shopping list whenever I think of the item.  In the kitchen, the living room, the bedroom – if I remember, I can ask Alexa to add the item and she does and confirms it has been added! No digging for a piece of paper that just gets left behind, or a pen, or opening an app on the phone… *sigh* I’m feeling rather spoiled.I haven’t gotten any of the linked outlets yet, but I will soon.  I recently purchased a set of five outlets with two remotes that I love – I can only imagine how much I will like a voice active option.One issue I have – and I know it’s one others have addressed – but linked Dots/Echo options would be very nice.  I would love the ability to sync all timers/music/alarms with an Echo and a Dot or two – of course the option to sync, not an automatic or for.  A Dot in a child’s room doesn’t need to be sync’d to the Echo in the living room – but the option to be able to sync that kitchen timer, music for a get together, etc. on the fly would be fantastic!Otherwise – so much fun!",0.827586206896552,"positive"
5,"E. Talerico","January 2, 2017","I'd been wanting to pick up an Echo since I first saw them advertised, but I already had a good stereo in my house and the Echo isn't equipped to connect to external speakers.  This unit is and its a delightful addition to my home music experience.  I now own two dots, each one serving a different room and playing over different speakers.  One is connected to a Harmon Kardon amplifier via Bluetooth, playing through a full sized pair of Yamaha speakers. The other plays alternately through either a Panasonic Bluetooth equipped boombox, or a pair of small computer speakers with a subwoofer. which I connect with an audio out cable.  The audio on all three devices is detailed and clear - my music as played by my Echo Dots is fantastic. By the way, there is a self contained speaker on the Dot - it is small, don't expect loud playback there - but the fidelity is quite good.  Its perfect for listening to the news over coffee in the morning, playing 20 questions, or finding out the weather forecast! The dot is small enough to fit easily in a backpack or the pocket of a suitcase, and she'll work as long as there is a Wi-Fi network available.I was amazed at how responsive to my voice this device is.  Amazon promises that it will hear you anywhere in the room where she is placed - and for the most part this is correct. I've had a few instances when I need to repeat a request - but usually its because something is obstructing my voice (like when my father put a book on top of it!)What is more amazing is how good, just out of the box, the unit was at understanding what I asked.  I have a voice which goes hoarse on me sometimes -( the day I got my first Dot I sounded as if I had laryngitis!) but regardless of the state of my voice, Alexa has no problems understanding my requests.  After some voice training (the Alexa app offers this feature) its even better.  I've had everyone in my house do the voice training exercise a few times and now Alexa is understanding and responding easily to every request she gets.  Its great.Coupled with the expanded Amazon Music service (I uploaded my entire iTunes library to Amazon Music) its easy to play anything I want.  I can ask for a song, a playlist, or an album and she'll find and play it easily.The only times I ever have problems is when the internet disconnects - in those rare incidences a request is met with a dull tone, a red light, and an apology from Alexa stating she can't comply right now.  When my network comes back online, she automatically reconnects so she is only occasionally out of service and usually only for a minute or two.And I've only talked about the music features.  There is a growing body of skills for Alexa, most of them available for free from Amazon that make her a formidable search engine, a source of weather reports.  My only disappointment so far is the lack of a skill enabling her to respond in emergencies, but I'm sure there will be enough demand for it that we'll see one soon!  For under fifty bucks, this is quite simply one of the best values anywhere.",0.794117647058823,"positive"
4,"jford40","January 9, 2017","I really want to like the Dot. I got it on Black Friday so at the price I couldn't resist. I did not get it to control smart switches or the temperature or anything like that. I got it mostly because my parents have the original Echo and this seems like the same thing in a smaller form. A few of my opinions and reactions to other reviews:- I am not sure why there are so many complaints about the speaker volume in this?? I have it in my living room and no matter where I am in the room I can hear Alexa just fine. In fact, most times I don't have the volume set above level 5. I don't know what others are doing that they say it is hard to hear, but for me I have zero issue with that!!- I knew it was small, but this thing is like the size of a coaster. I find that to be a plus because it can go basically anywhere and not even be seen if you prefer.- Set up and syncing with Wi-Fi was incredibly simple and I have had no issue since then.- I am slightly disappointed at what appears to be limitations on the Dot's vocabulary or word recognition. Alexa far too often confuses what I say, or is unable to provide answers to questions that should be easy to answer- The Alexa skills through the Alexa app are nice ways to add capabilities to your Dot, but I don't like how you then have to remember a different phrase for each individual skill you have enabled. I wish that enabling a skill became part of the Dot's natural interaction instead of having to identify it by stating the skill you want it to do.- Alexa is very useful in many ways. She is very good at math which my daughter found out doing her homework one day. Being able to call for an Uber or look things up on Wikipedia is fantastic. Getting the daily news in the morning, playing some Jeopardy, hearing the weather, or setting an alarm is great as well. I really like adding things to my to-do list. What is interesting is that Alexa's vocabulary does not seem stifled for this task as she will add verbatim whatever you say.- Alexa only Prime deals is another added benefit, although I have yet to actually find a deal I want to take advantage of I know that there have been some in the past that were truly great deals and only available with an Alexa enabled device.The final thing I will say is that I am glad that there is the ability to change the ""wake word"" from Alexa. For a few days I could not understand why it seemed like Alexa was talking when I would speak to my daughter. It finally dawned on me that when I would say my daughter's name, Alyssa, sometimes Alexa would interpret that as me saying Alexa!! She would also respond at times if the TV commercial for the Dot came on so just an fyi that her hearing can be sensitive!! Overall I think this is a fun gadget to have. I hope that it will continue to evolve in it's capabilities and that eventually it will do many more things without having to search for a specific skill to add to enable it to do things.",0.75,"positive"

5,"Donna Gleaves","February 12, 2017","Echo Dot's Alexa is spot-on, and has become a welcome, untiring, no-attitude family helper with a purpose.  Do a web search for its capabilities, and you may be astounded.  There's lot s of comparison currently between Amaxon Echo Dot snd Google Home. I'm sure the latter will fill many needs, but its a closed system, is brand-new. Echo has been around for 2 years.  Because of Ech's open programming architecture, people keep writing new apps for it and expand its capabilities and versatility.  For our first foray into this on-line, modern, simple appliance-style AI, we decided that cheap was the way yo start.  The inexpensive Echo Dot's audio quality is, well, small -we knew thst from the outset. However,  our excellent-sounding  Samsung Multiroom R1 speaker has Bluetooth input, and so, after simple pairing, two simple words, ""Alexa, connect"" will send all subsequent Echo Dot, high quality audio to the R1, until I say ""Alexa,  disconnect"" -but, so far, I haven't wanted to disconnect it since we got it weeks ago!  Some BT devices are a bit squirrely with Bluetooth connections - but not Amazon Dot!  It's been the simplest and solidest BT we've ever used.Do we sound happy? The longer we have Alexa, the more uses we discover. It's the best $50 we've ever spent.For example, we use our Echo Dot mainly for home control: after decades of struggling with a cranky old-tech X10 home control system, Alexa accurately and effortlessly commands our new Insteon lighting system to control on, off and brightness by voice (though can't yet set timers or schedules without complex use of other apps and hardware).  Alexa can also command other, otherwise incompatible, home control technologies, thus becoming the go-between remote control among various brands of lightbulbs, dimmers, switches, thermostats and more. And, even without voice training,  our Echo Dot's voice recognition is amazingly accurate, and Alexa's synthetic speech is top-quality  and pleasant to listen to.  If need be, you can follow its recognition and actions on its smartphone app and offer tweaks to improve accuracy.  Then. There's the entertainment side.  Switching among the three NPR affiliate network systems we have in Montana is but a couple of words away.  Then, there's Pandora. Or TuneIn. Or a number of other audio sources. My ""Flash Briefing"" contains the news, sports weather, and other bits & pieces we choose to stitch together as a patchwork we can request at any moment, and the contents will always be timely.  Time? Weather? Just a simple request! And, at our house, it works from any of several rooms, eith only one device.Sure, I've seen long lists of things Alexa can't do (yet) -smugly written, perhaps by fanboys of Google or Apple.  But what ""she"" CAN do is astounding, and sometimes even from a room or two away!Wow!!",0.75,"positive"
4,"Jacquelyn","January 10, 2017","I think I bought too many o.o.These really are a nice price and they allow easy access to Alexa from any room in your house. The device comes with its own speaker (not great, but works), however she can be easily paired or connected with other speakers.The moment you say her name, she's listening. Her range and ability to hear us out really feels good. I have spoken to her from across a room while someone else (in-between me and the device) is playing games on their speakers, talking to their friends on Discord, without issue. You can ask her a variety of questions (When is the next Superbowl? When is the next Green Bay Packers Game? What is the weather? Who let the dogs out?) and she seems to always have a response. If there is something she doesn't know, you can look to expand her skills with the Alexa App. This app is fairly easy to use, though the interface could be smoother (navigating is a tad clunky). I already added skills such as LIFX to control my lights and honestly - this is really fun.Now, Alexa isn't perfect. I have ran into a few odd things that I do hope Amazon will someday address. For example:Having all of my smart devices (such as lights and TVs) plugged in and on so that I may control turning them on and off with apps and Alexa works great - until the power goes out at 5am. The moment the power returned, all my lights, TV, and even Alexa turned on. There may be a solution to this, but I will need to explore (such as setting schedules and having the devices check the schedule when powered back on). Until then, I fear power outages.Alexa is always listening. If anyone says her name (TV commercial, Radio, a friend on Discord) she will respond. Being able to customize her name to Echo or Amazon instead doesn't fix the issue either. Having a custom name so that she really becomes ""my"" household device would really alleviate this. I do understand there are issues with people creating their own custom names, but even Alexa sometimes doesn't hear her name correctly and she will randomly jump into conversations picking up on phrases we can't quite figure out.Combine the above issue with an accidental command to purchase (ie: News reporting a cute story about how a little girl accidentally purchased a dollhouse and then saying how funny they though it was that ""Alexa, ordered me a dollhouse""). In just explaining the story to a friend over Skype I even accidentally triggered their device to try to order a dollhouse! Luckily you can turn ordering off or add a pass code, but caution that this is not the default.Honestly though, that's about all I take issue with. The way Alexa allows me to command my devices through voice is really a new and fun experience. I really look forward to how this device will grow as smart homes become more popular.",0.580645161290323,"positive"
4,"Hybridness","January 19, 2017","There are a sea of in-depth reviews that would easily trounce what I have to say about my experiences with Alexa, but after having it for roughly a month, here are my thoughts on it.- One thing that gets to me is the inability to sync my iPhone calendar to it; when I called Amazon support about it, they confirmed at the time that this is something that was not possible to do.- Another thing that irks me is the inability to request Alexa to remind you to do (insert task) at a certain time (unlike Apple's Siri). As an example, if I say -- ""Alexa, remind me in 30 minutes to move the clothes from the washer to the dryer"" -- it will state that it will create a to-do list item that states ""30 minutes to move the clothes from the washer to the dryer"" but does not provide the timed reminder to do so.- One very minor item revolves around the management of alarms in the Alexa app. If you get in the habit of requesting an alarm verbally from her (""Alexa, set an alarm for one hour from now"" or something to that degree), after about a month, you will notice, within the Alexa app, that there are ~30 different alarms set). A little more to follow on the Alexa app itself.On the other end of the spectrum though, the product was only 40 bones at the time of purchase. It has a more than adequate-sound, down-firing speaker that plays music and spits out information at a very high volume at max volume. It can easily recognize your voice (and other people's voice when requesting something from Alexa), even if there is music playing or other people talking in the background. The physical controls on the top of the device (mute, volume up/down, multi-function button) work very well with no issues. The USB power block and cable is not too bulky and is roughly 6' in length, respectively, which is a great thing as you can place the product anywhere you need to. Alexa even has Alexa-only unique deals (at an even lower/special discount) for some nice items!I will state, though, that the Alexa app is a necessary aspect of the device, for better or worse. The app, while not bad, could be organized better as well as load up faster/be more responsive on my iPhone 7. It does get the job done and you are able to find everything you need about the Dot on the app, but as said before, it could be programmed/designed more effectively for a better user experience.In the end, because of the first two items I mentioned, coupled with the Alexa app's quirks/performance issues, I have to give it a four out of five. By all means it is a good product, perhaps even a great product for those that have not experienced or do not have my aforementioned concerns. I was originally intending to return it, but because of all the little things it can do, it overshadows the things it (currently) cannot do for me.",0.56,"positive"
4,"Savvy Scott","January 16, 2017","As an voice-interactive home assistant, Echo is not a generalist nor is it comprehensive; it is limited to specific ""skills"" and only responds to coined instructions.  However, it does several things well, and improvement would come from future system development at Amazon's Alexa servers:Excellent Facets:1.  Recognizes voice through training, even at different volume levels, with a good microphone.2.  Performs specific functions (e.g. shopping list integrated with Amazon.com's Wish List, calculations, phonebook search...)3.  The breakout use if voice control of SmartThingsNeeds Improvement1.  Intelligent interrogation of all the contents of Wikipedia (and of arch-nemesis, Google.com).  Alexa is currently NOT very ""smart"" as it only understands specific works/instructions in pre-programmed ""skills"".2.  Ability to limit acceptance of voice commands to specific individuals' speech; otherwise, any intruder could simply break in and disable Smart home security systems.  Either advanced voice pattern security (which could be ultra difficult) or a ""pass sound"" (spoken word, phrase, number or whistle etc.)3.  Interpretation of foreign languages: first simply words, then entire sentences (dare I say, using Google Translate?)4.  Ability to integrate VoIP or link to cell phones so one can seamlessly connect to others.5.  For connected home applications like SmartThings, also allow consultation of the status of sensors (temperature, light, open/closed...) not just issue commands for action.  e.g.  Alexa, which doors are open?  which doors are closed?  how long has door X been open/closed?  how long has there been motion detected continuously in the bath (in case a person has fallen in the bathtub and can't get up)?  what is the temperate at the thermostat, in the garage, in the bedroom?6.  In case of electrical failure or ISP disconnect (as happens frequently during storm season), the device should emit an alarm or notice, and offer the possibility of connecting via a mobile operator.ThoughtsAlthough currently limited in skillset, Alexa performs those pre-defined action well.  It's hardware is compact, works well and is inexpensive.  Just for the ability to control a ""smart home"" by voice could justify purchase, especially for elderly or less-mobile individuals.  Further improvements won't mean replacing hardware but developing the processing servers.The biggest competitor would be from Google that could limit access of its services by Amazon if Alexa were ever to become ""paying"" i.e. Google could prevent another company from reselling its service.  Google also has the translation/interpretation platform that is the mastodont in machine translation.",0.620689655172414,"positive"
5,"D.G","February 1, 2017","I purchased 3 of these, 2 as holiday gifts and 1 for myself and am thus far very pleased with it. It's handy as an alarm, timer and to get general information such as weather anywhere in the world. It can tell jokes, play games and give basic general information on a wide variety of topics. I purchased Amazon Music Unlimited for the Dot which is on $3.99 a month and can play anything from that library. I understand it also works with other paid music services like Spotifly but I opted to go with Amazon. The Dot comes being able to do certain tasks but you can customize yours with a huge range of Skills you can easily add and remove from your Dot. You can even create your own skills to use with your Dot and offer them out to other Dot users. My only disappointment is there is not yet language translation, but with the capabilities of this little machine I'm certain that capability will come sooner than later. I do not have a remote for mine but find the ability to control the Alexa from the app in my phone and by voice to be enough. It has a built in speaker which is relatively loud for such a small until but can also connect to wireless Bluetooth Speakers and does have a port for wired speakers as well. Its built in microphone can be sensitive at times. If I speak too loudly to mine it can activate the one in the bedroom next door, or if my television is too loud and a Dot commercial comes on, it as well can activate the machine. There has been issues with small children ordering things through the Dot accidentally so this is not something I would recommend for use by children without supervision and the Dot does come with a button in the unit to mute its microphone so it cannot be accidentally activated by voice. However if you are using your Dot within too close proximity to any kind of external speakers and the music is loud the Dot will not hear your commands over the volume of the music so it's best to keep the Dot and any external speakers separated a bit to solve that small issue.Overall I've very much enjoyed using my Dot so far. For me it is more of an entertainment because I do not have the ability (yet) to use the Smart Home capabilities. However my son does have a Smart TV and he says that it can link to the Dot and he can use the Dot to voice control his television. I've not seen this done so cant speak to how well it works but do know it has capabilities beyond what I am currently able to do with it. The cost of the unit is very reasonable to get a taste of the latest tech, and what I think will become more prominent and useful tech in the not too distant future. Even if you can only use it for entertainment as I currently do, I would highly recommend the Echo Dot to purchase as a gift for others or for yourself.",0.785714285714286,"positive"
2,"Eduardo Neecha","November 30, 2016","First off, the Alexa app failed to work properly on my Android tablet (Google Nexus 7), gave up after 3 attempts of installing and uninstalling and reinstalling.  Amazon's ""spinning circle of death"" (just like Apple's ""spinning wheel of death"") basically would never stop spinning and totally froze up the app every time!  This was a bad omen for things to come.Finally had to use my laptop to set up this device, and even that took a bit of aggravation and delays.  Not nearly as smooth and simple as claimed.Once finally set up, the Echo kept getting disconnected from my wifi even though my other wireless devices (laptop, tablet) were fine,so I knew it wasn't my router or wifi carrier's fault.Generally speaking, whenever it did work, I found this device to be exhausting and annoying to use with all the delays.  The lag between saying ""Alexa"" to making the command to waiting for the command to be executed, was just way the heck too long.  The only things that seemed somewhat snappy were simply queries like ""What time is it?"" or ""How's the weather for tomorrow?""  It also seems to understand a dismally small range of commands, even compared to the voice-driven Google app on my tablet.I bought this device mainly because I use Amazon Music a lot, with my Prime membership.  The Amazon stream includes about 10-20% horrible songs that I have to skip over such as playing (gag!) ""smooth jazz"" garbage in the middle of ""traditional jazz"" stations.  (It was more like 40% crappy tracks in the beginning, until several weeks of my ""thumbs down and skip"" commands on various tracks improved things a bit.)  I bought the Echo Dot hoping that I could down-vote/eliminate the crappy content and ""add to library"" the good stuff, without needing to run back and forth to my computer all the time, since I run my computer's audio output to my music receiver and speakers.(Wish they'd make some kind of RF remote control for the Amazon Music player, I'd happily pay for that!)Also, I don't think the Echo dot has much onboard memory, judging from how often it would pause and stutter while streaming music---suggests that there is really not much buffering going on.  Simply outrageous considering how cheap memory has been for the last couple years.  Streaming was much smoother and reliable on my computer.Just not ready for prime time yet.

5,"Fel J. Cruz","March 11, 2017","I love this thing. The only thing it lacks is portability. You can buy the Fremo battery base which is great if you use your Echo Dot away from its power source for about 6 hours, but I wanted more than that. Searching  through Amazon, I found everything I needed to build a way to run my Echo for more than 16 hours nonstop from a P108 Ryobi battery. You'll need the P111 battery charger and gut everything except the battery contacts so you can run power to a Drok DC-DC converter, and a short micro USB cable. It's ugly, but also kinda cool.",0.6,"positive"

I think that if I were not a Prime member I would not enjoy this as much as I do.  Because I have Prime there is a ton of music that I can listen to.  This is a bonus.I get very aggravated when I ask simple questions that Alexa dos not know. For that reason I bought a Google Home.  Google knows a ton more than Alexa does.I like that I can listen to my Audible books on Alexa, which cannot be done on Google.I like that I can tell Alexa to order me things.I like that Alexa plays Jeopardy every night.I like that Alexa can make appointments on my calendar, Google can't.There are a lot of positives for Alexa and I think that they are going in the right direction.

4,"Abraham C","January 5, 2017","I will base this review as the echo dot/alexa being my first home automation product.As an avid technology enthusiast, I got this product recently and was amazed about all the things it could do, but other times I would feel it just as lacking in other aspects and I will elaborate on this.Echo Dot (hardware):-Design: very sleek design, with the colorful lights I don't mind having it as a piece in a table in my living room/bedrooms.-Mic: Sometimes I have a gripe not sure if with the voice recognition or with alexa, but when I am not facing its way it fails to recognize the voice commands sometimes.-Connectivty/setup: very simple to setup connect, didn't take me more than 5mins to have it up and running after installing the app on my phone.In terms of hardware I don't see on much that they can improve, maybe have a battery in it to allow portable mobility, but other than that this is almost a perfect polished product.Alexa:Usability: As a voice command I am surprised at all the things it can do, other times amazed at the things it can't do or fails to recognize. It is best to play around with it, it can turn off the lights/switches/power depending on what you have connected to your smart home. The most common feautre is playing music and it does really nice with that. I also speak other languages and would like to have the ability for alexa or any voice automated system to recognize multi language song names, rather than just authors, but that is not a showstopper.Voice Recognition: Sometimes I am amazed at how much this technology has improved over the last few years, voice recognition is almost perfect, would rarely have a mistake where alexa fails to recognize what I am saying if I am at a distance of about 10 feet. Even if it recognizes what I am saying, sometimes it fails to be able to do anything about it. It kind of reminds me of my girl when she tells me that I am hearing her but not listening and that there is a difference between the two. I guess this is karma in the form of alexa ;)Overall this is a nice product and I am sure I will purchase future generations when they come out, for now I will continue tinkering with it.",0.72,"positive"
2,"Eric Smith","April 3, 2017","OK, maybe Alexa deserves a better rating given she does what she is advertised to do. But after having her in the house for a month, I found the Echo Dot was only being used for novelty purposes or responding to false positives. At the price point, it seemed like a good opportunity to try out a home assistant, but it wasn't something we used on a daily basis. In hindsight, it seems pointless to use in conjunction with a smart phone. I have a Nexus with Google Assistant which does everything the Echo was doing for me and usually does it better. Plus the phone is almost always with me rather than isolated in one room of the house. ""OK Google..."" works with my IoT switches and outlets, news briefings, weather updates, online information and adding items to my shopping list. Aside from novelty, I see no point is buying into another eco-system unless you really like instant ordering from Amazon.",0.769230769230769,"positive"
3,"John P. Sheppard","December 27, 2016","The echo dot is pretty impressive and I expect to continue using the two (and maybe more) that I have bought. One is attached to the old stereo receive, providing an inexpensive upgrade for streaming and using voice commands. The other works great for listening to music and the news using the built in speakers.I'm actually reviewing the Alexa ecosystem more than the actual Echo Dot. I'm only giving it three stars for basic areas where it should be better. 1) MUSIC: For example, when you say ""Alexa, play Christmas music by Jon Batiste,"" the answer is ""I'm sorry, I can't find any Christmas music by Jon Batiste.""  Yet, Jon Batiste was featured on Amazon (An Amazon Music Original, no less) and Amazon Prime.  If I just asked for ""music by Jon Batiste"" it found selections, so the issue was not how I said the artist's name.  [Note to Amazon, when you request feedback from within the App, you should ask for feedback when Alexa fails. Currently you only ask if Alexa took the right action when it does something. This means you have a HUGE gap in your feedback loop.]  2) LISTS: Another area that has been disappointing are shopping lists. Anydo and the Alexa shopping list consistently failed to sync. It works better with todo.ist. But, this type of functionality should just be there.  And, you need the third party app to share with others. Without the synching, the shopping list feature is only good for singles without roommates. 3) TRAFFIC: Was also disappointed when I tried to find out about traffic to the airport. First, I had to go to the app and load the airport as my ""commute.""  I typed in Philadelphia *International* Airport (in Philadelphia, PA). Even though it knew my location, it defaulted to the Philadelphia *Municipal* Airport in Mississippi, and told me I had an 18 hour commute. Google would not have made this error.These may seem like petty issues, but given how well Amazon does other things, it suggests the focus is not so much on making Alexa better as it is finding ways to sell more through Amazon.  And, now that there is a one-month backlog on the Echo, I plan on making Google Home my next purchase and watching how both platforms evolve.",0.636363636363636,"positive"
5,"Jonathan Feist","December 16, 2016","Let's be fair, I've only had this unit for a couple weeks, but already I am using it more and more every day. I have had Google's voice assistant at the ready through phones and tablets for years, and have used it, but all of a sudden, voice activated computing is a thing that makes sense. I dare say that I like this better than Google's Android experience.The always listening aspect is a little weird sometimes, but the fears of that are the same physical features that make this an amazingly useful product. No matter where you are in the room, just yell out your hotword and issue your command.The internal speaker is more than good enough to read you the news or inform you of the weather, connect via 3.5mm or Bluetooth to a speaker and you've got your music blaring. Particularly like that you can control the volume by voice as well. To that end, my favorite part is that I can just tell it to stop, cancel or whatever and it stops doing whatever it's doing.Giving this device credit for Amazon putting solid human needs into the Alexa service and offering down-to-earth functions and use-cases is amazing. Google and Apple both always show off their voice services ordering food or booking a table at the local restaurant. Good for them, this unit has hundreds of Skills, apps, that can do things like keep me entertained or remember when I put that spaghetti in the fridge. Sure, there's some Amazon Prime stuff that's, sort of, annoying, but overall, this is a personal assistant that I can get used to.Best of all, I won't be bombarded with targeted ads across my entire online existence based on the searches and such that I perform on this device. The Echo Dot is not attached to my Google Account, like Google Home, so others in the house can use this thing without messing up my schedule, or reading my email. Sure, they could make purchases on my account, but there's settings to block that.Basically, where I don't use the phone based voice assistants because they're either in my pocket, or I have the phone in hand anyway so why not just type my search, and I don't want to have to create another Google Account just to be able to share a Google Home in the house, boom, Echo Dot, $40 on sale, done deal and couldn't be happier with it.I laughed when I saw the multi-pack deal of these units, but now I get it.",0.782608695652174,"positive"
4,"Liv","January 14, 2017","Great price and fun to play with. If you're interested in smart home technology this is a great place to start since it's easy to use and connect to other devices down the road. I bought several as Christmas gifts and when people figured out how to use it they loved it. The built in speaker is ok, I knew it wasn't as good as the more expensive Echo so I wasn't disappointed. If you already have a Bluetooth speaker or sound quality isn't a huge factor for you out of the box then you can't beat the price.  I don't have any issues hearing Alexa's responses with the built in speaker, but when I want to listen to music I just connect my Bluetooth speaker (very easy to do) and can move it around the house with no problems. We have a dot on each floor of our house (2 stories) that are located in the most used areas. I keep a Bluetooth speaker in our bedroom and use the Alexa remote to interact with the Dot in our tv room since she can't hear me as well. This allows you to still connect to, and hear Alexa, without having to yell and strain to hear her.The shopping list and to do list feature I really like since I'm horrible at writing down what we need around the house before I go shopping. I just tell her what to add to my list as I notice it, and it instantly shows up in the Alexa app which I can open when I get to the store and add/delete items. I also love these features to capture random things I want to research later like book titles, tv shows, serial numbers for parts etc that I might forget if I don't have it written down somewhere.The only reason I didn't give the dot 5 stars is because most of the skills that are available right now leave a lot to be desired. I'm sure down the road this will improve but there isn't a lot to choose from right now that has a lot of practical use. Like a lot of people I would prefer Alexa be able to answer questions based on a Google search rather than having to enable skills for different things. If I want to know what flu symptons are she doesn't understand what I'm asking. But when you factor in everything she can do, and what she can connect with, then the dot is definitely still worth purchasing based on the price.",0.769230769230769,"positive"
5,"Wolf I. Butler","December 28, 2016","I received this as a gift and am already ordering more for my home.First- the voice recognition is fantastic, even in a noisy room, while playing music, or watching TV. Second- this thing ties to almost every smart home device you might have. No more fighting with Siri just to understand what I am saying in a quiet room, only to hear ""I'm sorry- I can't do that right now."" for the thousandth time with no explanation. Alexa comes closer to something ""just working"" than any other similar product I have tried.It took me all-of 20 minutes to set the Echo Dot up with my Hue lights, Ecobee smart thermostat, and Harmony remote system, including tweaking some names and group names to suit my needs. Even after ""buying-in"" to Apple's ecosystem- I can't get Siri to do half as many things as Alexa does, much less doing anything reliably. As I said- Alexa just works. She understands exactly what I say 90+% of the time, and acts on it as expected.I really love that I can ask for things like ""Alexa- what will the weather be like tomorrow?"" and she actually tells me, instead of directing me to look at my phone or just ignoring the fact that I said ""tomorrow"" and giving me today's weather. I also love the customizable news summary I can get just by asking, which is already streamlining my mornings.I do want to clear up a misconception that at least I had about the Dot. You don't NEED an external speaker to use it- the Dot actually has a very capable little speaker built-in, similar in quality to a decent mobile phone or tablet speaker. It won't fill a room with sound like the full-fledged Echo, but for playing music in a kitchen or just alerting you with an alarm or allowing Alexa to talk to you- it is perfectly adequate. Even with the TV on- I can hear Alexa quite clearly from across the room with no external speaker. The Dot can also connect to a Bluetooth speaker if you want it to.Alexa seems to be evolving significantly faster than Siri or even Cortana. I really hope this trend continues. I'm planning to deploy Dots all over my house over the next few months.",0.833333333333333,"positive"
5,"Gloria Shone","January 7, 2017","I picked up a couple of these while at Lowe's before Christmas,  One for upstairs and one for downstairs. I already had two Bose Bluetooth speakers to Pair them to. The set up was a little more than I had bargained for, but Amazon help was very helpful.  A friend told me she had bought one and took it back because it did not have unique content. Oh boy, I am glad I did not listen to her. True, you can do just about anything Alexa can do some other way,  just not as conveniently, and some things you just would not do because they would be too much trouble. I can easily play just a couple of tunes when I am upstairs and then with a quick command, stop that, walk downstairs, and get her going again.  No fumbling with the radio,  tablet, or phone. I am especially enjoying listening to music I had practically forgotten. She is a good complement to Pandora because she can play music by the artist you specify, or even a specific song, instead of a genre like Pandora. Alexa will also play a mix of  Artists.  You do not have to own the music she plays. Sometimes I have her play bedtime music for example.  I will be happy when she stops mixing in holiday music. It seems most every artist has a holiday album.  However, you can tell her to skip anything you don't want to hear. I enjoy using her alarm settings because I can easily change them every night or even for a nap, a task that would be more time-consuming than it is worth on the clock radio.  It is easier to ask her for the time than to look at my bedside clock. For the news briefings,  she defaulted to NPR which I like, but then I discovered I can add local briefings.  She is good at keeping up with sports scores and can tell you when the games will be played, but she does not know on what network. It is fun to discover what she knows -  she knew all about full moons and waxing and waning.  She couldn't answer questions about current movies.  I love that she can  give me local phone numbers which are harder to find of the web these days. she always gives the number for the location nearest me.Definitely a worthwhile purchase.",0.842105263157895,"positive"

5,"D. Coral","December 28, 2016","It's hard to tell how you're actually going to use this until you try it!Before I received the Echo Dot 2, I thought maybe I would use it for quick research like ""tell me about antheraxanthin supplements"" -- but I'm not using it like that because I haven't figured out the right way to say the phrases so she understands what I'm seeking.Instead, I find the Echo to be super useful as a helping hand for daily routines: change the thermostat temperature, turn on and off the lights, tell me what time it is, set the alarm clock for the next morning, tell me the fastest route to avoid traffic, and especially to play music.As a former musician I'm picky about speakers so I did a lot of research on the best sounding bluetooth speaker under $200.  I ended up purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3.  The Bose Soundlink III also has amazing sound quality but unfortunately the Soundlink III switches off 30 minutes after no longer detecting a sound signal, so it's not practical to use the Soundlink III with Echo.The Bose SoundTouch 10 is also a popular speaker for use with Echo Dot, but you can get the better sounding Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3 for even less, available in both black and white.What really impressed me about Echo Dot 2 is that it wakes up even when I'm saying ""Alexa"" softly way across from the other side of the house.The only thing that bugs me is that I wish there was a better way to say home automation commands.  Alexa uses the phrase ""turn on"" for just about every home device (except for thermostats, which have additional commands).  So I would say ""turn on open window shades"" instead of simply being able to say ""open window shades.""  Alexa would be greatly improved if a user could add custom phrases that map to an automation command.But it's still a lot better than Google Home because for that product you have to say ""OK, Google"" to wake up, which is totally awkward to say all the time.  Amazon is much better at naming things -- Using ""Alexa"" as the wakeup command is pleasant to say.Two cute things to try with Alexa:""Alexa, do you like green eggs and ham?""""Alexa, tell me the truth.""",0.769230769230769,"positive"
4,"cvrichardson","December 26, 2016","I vacillated on whether to go 3 stars or 4 for the Echo Dot. Ultimately I decided on 4 because the potential and WOW factor is pretty steep on this product. The concept of having your own AI Valet/Butler/Girl Friday is very desirable, especially if you have a hectic schedule or lifestyle that keeps you on the run a lot. It is great for reminding you about appointments, helping you keep track of time and generally being more organised if you use it religiously. The UP side and future for this technology is very exciting and the potential is limitless. However, and this is the truth. It still has a long way to go. Being new tech, one has a tendency to forget that it is there and you almost have to push yourself to use it when you first are introduced to the product. The newness will wear off real quick once the novelty has faded and there are not many skills available that do not require purchase of some other hardware/software enabled product or another to take advantage of the potential of this product. Also, integration with older technology is lacking and it almost invariably pushes you to upgrade everything in your home just to use some of the best features of the product. In example, I have a two year old Denon AVR 7.2 Surround System that does not have Bluetooth. So to use the Dot with it I have to plug it into the AVR using a cable from the 3,5 mini jack on the Dot. Not a big problem except when you plug anything into it it will shut off the internal speaker (just like plugging into an old stereo with headphones) and you are limited to hearing the audible replies from Alexa only through that one device (the AVR) which means to use it for anything else you have to get up and unplug it from the older piece of hardware which negates the whole voice command interface which is what makes this thing so cool in the first place. SO, I give it a 4 because I see the future potential and like it, But, it's probably really a 3 (hovering near a 2) because it just isn't quite there all the way yet. If they want this to be a TRUE success story then they need to interface it with older gear until the buying public can catch up.",0.75,"positive"
5,"Amazon Customer","January 3, 2017","At first it was just a novelty item out of the box. It lost my interest and desire after the first few hours. Mainly because the music I wanted was not registering right on my radio stations. She understood what I said but would not play what I specifically asked for. However, once I started the echo music plan it was night and day. I love the choices! We threw so many song requests yesterday night at Alexa and she played all but one song. From moods to genres and specific songs. My home layout is pretty open and so I only require one dot for my house. The second will be when I start to purchase the smart home devices. I recommend the 3.99/month subscription for music. It is much better than using the free radio apps. Its the cost of one coffee at starbucks for a whole month worth of unlimited music. The sound produced by the Dot gets the job done for just about half my house. I plugged her into a sound bar I used for my TV and it works amazingly with high quality crisp surround sound. The 50$ investment for this device is what made me buy this in the first place. If you love technology and music you should take the plunge and buy this. The Dot offers other skills that includes games but I have barely scratched the surface on what it can really do. Oh by the way. If you have a thick Spanish accent, she will recognize you as long as you pronounce your words clearly. It was hit or miss with my mother. Her accent is not even that big. She has an accent like Penelope cruz. So, if you have an accent, speak with patience and over annunciate. Learn the short command phrases. Oh and pronounce hispanic names like an american. She will understand.I have a daughter that is 5 and she understands her very well. She requests disney music and animal noises and has a lot of fun using Alexa.She also asks her questions. Most of the questions she asks Alexa doesn't know the answer to. Keep in mind these are 4-5 year old questions of which requires the rational response of an adult and not a machine. ""why are sticks on the ground?"" ""Why are bricks red?"". ""Where do babies come from?"".",0.84,"positive"

3,"Alfred M. Freitas","December 16, 2016","I purchased the new Echo Dot because  I had previously purchased the Alexa and enjoyed the ability to play music, set times, different news, ask questions  And so forth.  When the Dot was released I purchased several of them to place in each room in my house. I was aware that they could not be ""synced"" but felt that that was a feature that would soon be added because of its popularity.  After having read a considerable amount of material which positively reviewed the Alexa and Philips Hue, I purchased some some Phillip's LED lights  as well as  a Phillips hub.  I installed the Hue  and downloaded the Alexa Hue app. and asked Alexa to ""discover"" the Hue hub.  After Alexa discovered  the lights,  I proceeded  to use Alexa to turn the lights on and off. Much to my surprise, Alyssa told me there were many Hue light devices  and ""which one did I want"".  After many many attempts I still could not find out from Alexa one of those ""many devices"" were.  I tried many uninstalls, reinstalls, and modifications with no luck. I purchased a  Cree LED light bulb and a GE  LED light.  I have no problem finding and controlling the GE light bulb but could never discover the Cree light.  Alexa can out turn on and off one of the four lights I have installed but does not recognize some or tells me that the other light bulbs have many devices ""which one should I choose"". Once again Alexa does not tell me what devices I can use, it only tells me there are several. Based on my experience with  HUE ,I do not believe that the Dot is ready for ""prime time"".  A couple of other minor issues with the Dot  include the Dot randomly opening and  and  telling me that he did not understand my question. Another annoyance, is that sometimes when I give it a command that will say okay but nothing happens and I have to ask again for it to take the action I requested. Often while playing music through the Alexa, or the Dot  I will have to shout ""Alexa"" in order for it to respond.  The issues are not ""deal breakers"" but they are disappointing.  As a side note, when I used Siri  to control the license the Hue  app worked perfectly.  I sincerely hope that Amazon improves the AI  for Alexa as time goes on.",0.666666666666667,"positive"
5,"Steve P.","January 19, 2017","I am learning the skills and there are one or two problems. But I love this device.Problems:Volume. Using the Dot's built-in speaker works really well. It's not a high fidelity experience, but definitely good for spoken word. Music is...alright..but won;t replace a better set of speakers. Although the volume problem is present using the native speaker (the news brief is far softer than the Alexa voice...so Alexa is yelling at you if you want to hear the brief across the room...it's magnified with external speakers attached to the Dot. So you have to either use the physical buttons to turn the volume up, then down - or use the ""alexa - volume up/down"" command multiple times - which is cumbersome. Also, on my system (windows 10 - anniversary) you lose the native windows equalizer feature when playing over bluetooth, so you are left with whatever built-in problems are with your speakers (mine have overly boomy bass without EQ)so I can stream anything from my PC to Dot as BT speakers...but I lose my equalizer settings when I do.Services:You have to have premium services for some things to play directly from Dot. Spotify is a skill that has to be premium. That wasn't clear to me up front (probably my fault for not researching more). So if you have a ""must-have"" check in advance.Pro's.This machine is awesome.  Even before tuning to my voice it recognizes what I say, I can hook it to PC's, tablets and pretty much anything. It has a VAST selection of native talents, and the skills that are available are great. I can sit here and do my work and chatter at Alexa via my dot and get music, news, weather...I have tried a few household control things and they work just fine.Everytime I use it I learn more things it can do - mostly useless (even if fun) but a lot useful. I can live with the volume problem, also some sales crap which is off-putting, and I use this thing all the time for music, weather, news...basic questions that come up in online arguments. And it really amplifies my other devices.",0.620689655172414,"positive"
5,"WontPontificate","December 7, 2016","Over the past couple of years, I've been trying to make my home smarter.  I started with Hue, using Philips bulbs along with GE and Cree bulbs connected to my Hue bridge, controlling my lighting with widgets on my phone.  From there, I picked up a Harmony hub and remote to consolidate my remote clutter down to a single remote, and then added a smartthings hub to the stable, to support Z-wave stuff.My home is certainly smarter, with timers for the lights, and presence sensors, and the ability to control everything from my phone, but I craved more! I decided to dip my toe into the world of voice command by buying an Echo Dot.  And what can I say, it works better than advertised.I expected that the press for the Echo would be a little over-exaggerated, which is what made me hold off of a device like this until now (that, and feeling a bit silly about yelling at my house to have it do things) but to my surprise, it's recognized all of my commands out of the box! The few it wasn't able to parse were my fault, not Alexa's.The integration with my other smart home products has also been seamless.  Alexa picked up actions from my Harmony, the light bulbs from my hue bridge, and all of the scenes and devices I have in SmartThings, obeying them quickly and without complaint.When I received the Dot, I was fully expecting it to have no built in speaker at all, and was quite surprised to find it does have one -- and I was further surprised at the sound quality in such a diminutive package.  While I wouldn't really want to listen to music through it, it's more than adequate for Alexa to talk to you through.I have my Dot plugged into my stereo system, which at first proved a bit of a problem, as Alexa has no idea whether it's on or off, and will try to speak through it rather than her own speaker.  I did find a workaround for this, in that Bluetooth audio takes priority over the audio out jack on the back of the dot.  I paired a cheap bluetooth speaker to the dot, and when I want to listen to music on the stereo, I tell Alexa to disconnect bluetooth, and she'll start playing through the audio jack.  If I turn the stereo off, I just ask Alexa to reconnect Bluetooth, and she'll play through the bluetooth speaker, which is left on all the time.I hope a future software update allows Alexa to speak through the internal speaker, but play things like audio through the audio jack, allowing her to be guaranteed to reply to requests, even if the speakers she's plugged into are off.Overall a great product and service! I am very happy with how it works.",0.8,"positive"
5,"Tory Klementsen","December 18, 2016","One of my splurges after working over the summer (as a teacher) was to purchase an Amazon Echo. I do teach IT so I love gadgets, but I'd held off on the Echo because I really didn't see a lot of practical need for it since I could play music from my computer, which is in my living room, and already gets all the stations my Echo gets.Oh how wrong I was! I love this thing! I splurged on an Echo and within a week knew I wanted a Dot in each room of my tiny little abode! First, of course, there is the music. I have eclectic taste in music. So whether I'm in the mood for Tony Bennet, Tchaikovsky, or Skrillex BAM Alexa's got my back. I can play Movie Quotes Trivia at the drop of a hat, make myself feel smart (or not so much) with Jeopardy, play ocean sounds at night and pretend I'm camping near the ocean, and get super important dog facts.I've had a somewhat smart home (circa 1925) for a few years now, and making it work with the Echo was a breeze. I've added a few TP-Link plugs, which were a tiny hassle, but not much. Being able to wake up and command the lights turn on from my bed without having to reach for my phone feels like something I once only dreamed of as a kid watching the Jetsons.I'm a HUGE podcast and audiobook listener. In fact, I was an Audible member when they very first started and had the original Audible player and LOVED it. I listen while I run and to be able to come in, hand off my book to Alexa and have her continue to read to me while I start dinner or grade papers is awesome. In the morning I start watching one of my favorite morning shows that also plays on Tune In Radio in the bedroom on the TV. When I walk out to the living room I just ask Alexa to start Tune In Radio, and she starts up my last station listened to.For podcasts I either play them using Stitcher, which works great on the Echo or use the Echo as a bluetooth speaker, since I use the Dot connected via a wired connection using an audio cable.If that's not enough to convince you, there are some fun YouTube videos with some things you can do with Alexa and a great website [...].",0.8,"positive"
4,"Kris S.","January 15, 2017","I bought the product and set it up.  That was very easy to do.  The app is easy to navigate and there is an ever growing list of skills.  Skills are like apps for Alexa that allow it to do many more things,  written by other companies.I easily tied Alexa into my smart home products like TP-Link lights and switches.  They work flawlessly.  Although with some naming I've used ""pendant lights"" and ""pocket lights"" Alexa misinterprets what I've said about 30% of the time.  So that's one area to improve on is understanding speech.I've tied her into my Logitech Harmony Hub,  and it does a great job working with that.  Logitech could add more features,  but that's not related to Alexa.  Alexa will turn on/off my tv, receiver, dvr and lights all with one voice command. You'll have to set that up in harmony and the smart home section of Alexa app.Basic searches work well for most items like weather,  time,  specific topics (random questions about celebrities,  animals,  etc). But anything more advanced she'll get hung up on.The shopping list is a feature I use regularly.  I just tell Alexa to add something to my shopping list and she will.  Sometimes she'll still misinterpret what I've said though.  When I'm at the store I can pull the shopping list up on my phone to see what I have to buy.I wish you didn't need Amazon Prime to get the deals or to even shop on Amazon through Alexa.  Seems like a trap to become a prime member just to use that feature.  It's already linked to my Amazon account,  just let me shop still.The last issue I have is with how far she'll hear me and if she'll understand with background noise.  It's hit or miss.  In a quiet room it's fine,  but if the tv is on its twice as hard and I almost have to yell my commands. I do have a large living room and kitchen is open to it.  So maybe it's the reason why.  About 48' long by 24' wide.All in all,  I love having Alexa and look forward to its improvements.  Not prefect yet,  but nothing ever is right?",0.758620689655172,"positive"

Just have to learn how to ask and it will do it.I have not tried the lighting add ons yet.Things not so much.-I feel like it is trying to teach me to speak to it correctly as opposed to it learning how i speak.-Questions like... what is tonight football game? Umm i don't understand you. That gets frustrating. I got two of them so i am vested. I can't help but think the google device may be better at understanding question and responding.-Having to say echo for follow up questions or requests.Something that is coolI moved all my music to amazon music and started to rebuild my playlists on that platform. it is nice to come home and say play this playlist and all your music plays. also your music is available any where.Hardwareit has decent distance to hear you if in a quiet room but if music is playing you do have to get close to it. My wife laughs when i say echo shut up! funny i even sometimes even apologize to it. Speakers are not bad but i do regret not getting the bigger one with the built in speaker for music. I did just hook it up to a blue tooth speaker i had but that seems Jerry rigged. may have to bite the bullet and get the taller one. I totally understand why people will get one for each room. you get spoiled quickly.Wishlists- follow up questions it be nice to have a conversation. an example ME... ""ECHO how is the weather?"" .... DOT.."".it is going to snow in your town"". Now i would have to say ""ECHO how is the traffic?"" i wish it would say ""it is going to snow in your town anything else?""  and give me 10 seconds to ask something else?-Ability to ask multiple question/requests Me ECHO what is the weather and traffic look like? or ECHO give me flash update then play Metallica playlist.

My smart home is definitely in its nascent phase, with only one smart device connected to the Dot.  But with it I can command a couple lamps to turn off and on.  I can see the future, and its getting brighter (pun intended).The reason this gets five stars is for the simple fact that the first time after my wife used the Dot and I asked her if we're keeping it, she grinned like a little kid given a puppy on Christmas morning!!!  I can't say there's anything I've bought recently that she finds as useful, engaging and fun as the Echo Dot.

However, I wanted white, dangit. The top sticks out like a sore thumb, and I want it hidden in a white room. I got it for my mom and she already tries to hide it enough, which deteriorates the recognition and sound quality.Shiny finish. I would much prefer matte, like the first-gen Dot.Audio ring on the first-gen Dot was more attractive. Albeit, maybe not as intuitive, and added some slight height/weight.Sorry, Amazon, but your logo isn't very attractive. An ""a"" or something would look way better.Doesn't do well with background noise or other people talking at the same time after making a request. To a lesser extent, doesn't do well when put against walls or objects.I haven't even covered the Alexa AI. While it still has a lot of learning to do, it still has an excellent base to work off of and will only get better and better. There is some fear about the ""always"" listening (although Wireshark proves it sends info only after a request is made. This disproves the always-on theories unless there's a local storage option that stores data...which tear-downs haven't shown. I also trust Amazon and they've shown to fight for users' Echo data privacy so far).In the end, this is totally worth it. Actually, I bought a six pack after trying the first-gen Dot haha.

2,"MD1983","March 29, 2017","Initially I was pretty excited about the Echo Dot, but found that it's quite limited in its functionality.  Basically I use it to set timers when I'm cooking, tell her to change the temperature on my Nest thermostat, sometimes to reorder stuff on Amazon, and to ask what the forecast is.  It is NOT like google where you can ask ""okay google, how long do I bake a potato?"" and it gives you an answer with time and temp for baking potato.  Alexa has no answers for you.  They keep emailing me cool things Alexa can now do, like give you funny answers to stupid questions, but I don't need her for entertainment.  I need hands free answers and directions.  There are some app type things you can download on her, like to order pizza from pizza hut or whatever, haven't used those.  Again, I just have a million random questions a day I need answers too, and she can't answer 9 out of 10 of them.I bought 2 of these when they were on sale for xmas, and over time realized I didn't like them.  Too late to return, or I'd return them and get the google version.Lastly, as I've become more and more disappointed by her presence, I get very angry if I ask her to do something and she doesn't hear me.  To avoid the anger, I just stay silent and get on my phone to do it, like change the temp using my Nest app.  It's like a sad, resentful marriage.

By this time, you know what it is and what could I say that hasn't already been said ...But a couple of tips and observations:- I've noticed that even if you don't change the Wake Word, and you have two in the same room (why I don't know, except maybe when changing settings), they will both wake, but only the closest one will answer. Cool.- If you plan to use the audio output jack, make absolutely sure that you use a quality USB power source. I made the mistake of using a spare USB port from a nearby router and got all kinds of noise and interference. When I switched back to using the supplied adapter, the output was clean and quiet.- Here is how I use one of my echos (oh yes, I have more than one: both were gifts) to switch between multiple outputs(1) I use two Bluetooth speakers. The primary one (Bose) is listed first, and will be chosen by default when you say ""Alexa Connect""(2) I use the audio output jack for my home theater, and it plays automatically when I say ""Alexa Disconnect""(3) The second Bluetooth plays whenever I turn off my little Bose speaker and then say ""Alexa Connect"".So, while you don't get them playing all at once, I can easily select to play to 3 different speakers without messing with the APP.Finally, I like to walk around with my echo sometimes, so I use USB chargers.Here are two I like (I included pictures):Looks way cool: New Design Portable Power Bank, Vivis Pi Ultra Slim 6000mAh Fashion Facial massager 2-Port Fast Portable Charger External Battery Pack Backup Charger with Makeup Mirror for iPhone 6, 6 plus, iPad Air 2 Mini 3, Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge and More (Black)Fits in a pocket: Smartwatch Charger (White) - Portable 2 x AA USB Charger with Built-n Light",0.714285714285714,"positive"

3,"sillieidiot","November 18, 2016","I got this as part of a bundle deal with the Harmony remote. At first, it was pretty cool. I'm not like a seasoned user of the echo though. I didn't even know if I had a use for it, and forced myself to try to use it until it just became a habit. I had it paired up with the Harmony hub. It can only do basic things like turn on/off things and that's about it. Yes you can change channels with it, but you can't do something as simple as like pausing and stuff like that which would have been way more useful for me than changing the channels. When it works, it works great. I don't have any problems with it at it's best. But there were a couple of seething issues that they need to address, and one minor one.First, the wifi connection. This thing keeps losing connection somehow. Mines placed like 8ft away from the router and it constantly loses connection.  I have no idea how. So you have to go through the setup again. The setup sucks too, because you can't even update the Wi-Fi on the Alexa app. It always shows a blank screen. So you gotta go on your laptop to alexa.amazon.com and do it that way. At first, it dropped the connection like once every like 4 days. then it just started doing it all the time. I used to just disconnect the power and reconnect it and it would pick it up on it's own. But after awhile, that doesn't do anything. In the time that it takes to setup, I would have been finished with that I wanted it to do already. Oh yeah, the other thing about losing the Wi-Fi with the Harmony hub. You have to tell it to rediscover the devices which take like 5 mins so that it can control the hub. That's the main thing that made me fed up and I returned it.Second, the microphone issue. As with everyone, it sucks. At first, it works really well picking up like 99% of what I say. Then slowly it picks up less and less. I think I was at like 40% by the time I decided to return it. I don't know what's wrong with it. I already did the voice training and everything and the first couple of days that thing was like spot on. Couple that with the Wi-Fi disconnect, it's like first it doesn't hear you, then when it does, it's like well too bad, I'm not connected to the internet to do anything. WTF, useless.The other minor thing is the Alexa app. You can't even set up the Wi-Fi the first time because it just does the blank screen thing. If I didn't go online and search for a workaround. I would have just returned it right away. Fix your app Amazon. The only reason why I consider it minor is because you could do the setup still with your laptop.Also with the 3.5mm jack. I haven't seen anyone post this issue, but on mines. Whenever I turn off the speaker that it's connected to without taking the cable out, it stills try to send audio to it as if it were still on. So hooking it up to my amp was pointless because when the amp is off, you can't hear Alexa. I'm not going to leave it on all the time. This happens with like portable speakers and stuff too. I'm not about to disconnect the cable every time. I ended up just using alexa to turn on my amp through the Harmony hub to play music instead.All in all, it's an okay device. I would pick it up again if they could iron out those issues. I feel like the it's like kind of software glitch or something that is going since it works really well in the beginning and then it slows down over time and these issues crop up. It is constantly uploading data though from what I could see on my router. I don't know what it's uploading though.",0.673076923076923,"positive"
4,"gd","December 29, 2016","There is a definite novelty factor to the Echo Dot and what  questions Alexa can answer. And it does offer a few convenience features. But it won't be long until you realize the Echo Dot and Alexa have a few shortcomings that prevent Alexa from transcending from a novelty item to a real productive virtual assistant. First, Alexa is all pull and no push. By that I mean the Dot is able to reach out and talk to other devices and cloud services when you initiate that conversation, but devices and cloud services cannot initiate the conversation themselves without Alexa reaching out first. This lack of support for push communications is very limiting. For example, take Alexa's ""reminder"". Say you would like to be reminded to take recycling out Tuesday mornings before leaving for work. All Alexa can do is add a ""to-do"" note in the Alexa app, and on Tuesday morning you will miss recycling again because the Dot won't notify you unless you ask Alexa what is in your to-do list that morning. That's just one simple use case that could easily be remedied by supporting push communications.Another shortcoming is Amazon's lack of a cloud productivity suite of its own thlo easily integrate with Alexa and support new skills.Finally, not a design flaw but still worth noting, Alexa does not offer voice based authentication. That is something important to keep in mind if you plan on having people over, as anyone can snoop through your to-do lists, shopping lists and calendars without your permission. I don't think anyone offers this level of security right now, so it's no surprise. But it would be nice to see Amazon break ground in this front first.Overall, this is a very cool product at a good price point. But the technology and the Alexa Skill Kit SDK is still very limited, so keep expectations low and you won't be disappointed.",0.571428571428571,"positive"
3,"Mic S.","November 30, 2016","I do like my Dot and it does make some things more convenient. However some things that you would think would be very simple she simply cannot do. For example, I started playing music at 100% volume, when I needed it a little quieter I said ""Alexa, set the volume to 50%"" and she had no clue what I meant. I had to go and search how to change the volume by voice and in order to change the volume you have to say ""Alexa, set the volume to (a number between 1-10)."" That's the only thing she understands for volume control. I have only had the Dot for one day so I have not run into a whole lot of other bugs yet. I am currently in the process of getting smart switches for my lights and a new thermostat for all the smart home automation and I will update my review once I get all of that.EDIT on 12-10-2016: I now have 7 of these setup in my house and my review is now going down to 3 stars (started at 4). The reason for this is again, simple things that you would think would be easy, Alexa cannot do. Another example, I have all my Dots named in the app (Kitchen, Livingroom, Loft, etc.) When I start playing music on my kitchen dot you think it would be easy to say ""Alexa, transfer the music to the loft"" but of course Alexa has no idea what you are even talking about. I have tried phrasing it differently and I came to the realization that no matter how you say it it's not going to happen. So if I like a song that is on I have to wait until that song is over because if I go into a new room I have to start the music over even if I choose the same station (through prime music). I have also tried playing music by saying ""Alexa, play pop music on all dots"" and again, no idea what I am saying so I tried phrasing it ""Alexa, play pop music in the entire house"" but she doesn't understand that either. I also took my review down to 3 stars because they say that if you have more than one echo dot within ear shot they automatically know which one you are closest to and only that one responds, this is true 95% of the time. However, I have on more than one occasion asked my kitchen echo dot a question and then heard the dot in the living room giving me a different answer at the same time as the one that I am closest to. For the most part I like my dots, but they really need to do some updating I think.",0.9,"positive"
3,"Paul","January 3, 2017","Amazon gave people a reason to try out home AI this year when they released this product, a standalone/tiny version of the larger Echo.  I have used the Echo Dot for about 1 week and have found it to be a pleasant, albeit flawed, device.The only difference between the two models from what I can tell is size and sound quality.  This is to ignore the second, mid-sized ""Echo Tap"" which only has value as a portable speaker and is not suited for use within the home.  The way this product, the Dot, was advertised led me to believe it needed to be plugged into an external speaker in order to work however it does in fact have a built-in speaker and can be used by itself.  The speaker is neither loud nor dynamic but it puts sound in the room when you need it to.The biggest flaw for me is with Amazon's dirty policy of refusing to allow competing services to work on it's devices.  I pay for streaming music through Google Play; however I cannot use the Echo to access this music because Amazon wants me to purchase music from them instead.  At the same time, Amazon has the Prime Video service I pay for;  they do not allow my google devices, such as my Chromecast-enabled television, to access Prime video because Amazon wants me to buy a stupid Fire stick instead.  The real craziness here is that Amazon runs it's entire Fire ecosystem on Android because Google gives it away for free (so there really is no excuse).In the end, I want to recommend this device because it's cheap, it's well-designed, and it's the first step in the new wave of home tech.  But at the same time, Amazon's policy of exclusion really hurts consumers and hinders their own success.  If you are a person who uses ""competing services"" such as Netflix, Tidal, Apple Music or Google Play, you probably want to wait for a more universally compatible home AI.",0.476190476190476,"negative"

From what I can tell: everything else is the same. I've added a few ""skills"" to my dot, from the Alexa app (examining the scriptures daily JW...which I LOVE!!!

I did find that some, although show to be ""enabled skills,"" aren't currently working...endless back/forth with Alexa as to whether they're actually enabled or not...she seems conflicted...so as I said some aren't working.She does awaken pretty easily usually, except maybe if/when I speak fast. I do love to use it when in the kitchen. ""Alexa, set a timer for 25 mins. Alexa what's the weather, Alexa play some Michael Buble, Alexa, how much time is left on my timer.?

4,"Jaye","November 21, 2016","I'm not a big tech junkie, but every now and again, certain tech items just seem ""right"" for me.  That was the case when I first heard of the Echo.  I researched extensively before deciding to purchase the Dot instead of the full size.  The only difference so far as I can tell is that the full size has a higher quality speaker, and since I'm not one to be overly concerned about sound quality, and don't like loud music, I decided to try this one.As for the speaker quality, it is far better than I expected.  All of the descriptions, articles, and reviews I read indicated that everyone with a Dot would have to connect it to a separate speaker.  If you like loud music, or are extremely concerned with a high sound quality, I suppose that's true.  But, after receiving my Dot yesterday, I don't necessarily agree.I expected to get about the same amount of sound out of this little gadget as I do from my Fire tablet.  Whoa!  It is so much more than that!  Now again, I know folks who like their music loud, and for that segment of the population, you'll want the external speaker.  I prefer music to be either mid-grade or soft background sound, and this more than does the trick.  I currently have it in a 180 sq ft room, and I personally cannot handle having it turned up to 10 (loudest setting) while in the same room.  My home is around 1300 sq ft, and with the Echo Dot on one end of the house, I can hear it at 10, though faintly, from the opposite end.  It's a long ranch house, so you get the idea I hope.Another positive is that setup was amazingly simple.  I'd received my Wemo plugs the day before, and they were a nightmare to set up - barely any instructions, and tech support was very difficult to reach.  But that's a separate review.  In any case, I was terrified I'd be spending several more hours trying to get this little thing set up, but quite the opposite.  Within about 5 minutes of removing it from the package, it was set up and linked to my Wemo switches!  Super easy, and not only simple but good instructions.Now on to the cons I've found so far.  First, despite what Amazon says, when the music is turned up, the microphones sometimes do not hear you speaking to it unless you shout.  That seems to be intermittent, though.I've added several ""skills"", and many of them have bugs or just don't work at all.  The one that I would find very enjoyable except that it doesn't work well is the Word Master game.  Alexa does not understand many of the words I say, and despite repeating them over and over again, I often have to just pick a different word.  I had the same issue with the Quick Event skill to add items to my calendar.  For some reason, she would not understand the word ""Thursday"" - although outside of this skill has no trouble with that word in general.I would also like to see a software update where you can spell a word if she does not understand, and then you can ensure it's accurate - especially when trying to add something to your calendar.My other complaint is that while Echo Dot is playing music, my Fire tablet which is linked to this device keeps its screen lit up.  I usually only have to charge my Fire once or twice per week, and yesterday went through around 80% of a full charge.  You can turn the display off on the tablet manually, but then as soon as you speak to Alexa again, it lights back up and you'd have to keep turning it off manually - which sort of defeats the purpose of having an Echo you can talk to!  I'd really love to see Amazon fix that, because I don't like the idea of draining the battery so fast all of the time and wearing it out faster than necessary.After using it for a little while yesterday, I decided to go ahead and purchase a Sensi smart thermostat to use with it.  I will be buying other Smart Home gadgets to connect with this a little at a time.  And, I may decide to purchase a second Dot for use in my studio at the other end of my home.  All in all, I'm quite happy with this new little toy, aside from the few things I've mentioned.  I will add updates as any other issues or benefits arise!",0.666666666666667,"positive"
4,"Linda","February 18, 2017","Still has a few quirks and doesn't always understand requests the first time, but this is quickly becoming a welcomed addition to my home and quickly making Alexa indispensable! (Example of easy to use skills: turning the TV on or off, increasing or decreasing TV or Stereo volume, Setting a morning alarm, or setting a  timer ( great when you're cooking and your hands are sticky!), Turing lights on or off, or inquiring about the temperature or weather forecast. One of my favorites is ""Alexa, what my news briefing for today: You chose which news sources you want to hear. This is great while getting ready for work in the morning.I did knock off a star because there is ONE MAJOR inconvenience for those people who have family sharing: For example, my daughter and son-in-law and I have family sharing for our Kindle Libraries and Alexa CAN NOT separate my shopping list or do do list from theirs. You can ask ""Alexa which profile are you in?"" and she will tell me she is is mine (not my daughter's Amazon account"", but every command I give alexa, and every command they give alex is merged into the SAME HISTORY, even though we have SEPARATE  Amazon accounts. My news briefing and skills are separated from theirs, but ""To do lists"" and Shopping Lists are merged.  At this time, my daughter and I have agreed that SHE will use Alexa for lists, and I will use my iPhone Siri for shopping and ""to do"" lists.  In addition,  there isn't any privacy with your Alexa use if you have family sharing. It seems to allow you to change your profile to anyone on your family sharing and control their Alexa as well... Interesting, I could say ""Alexa, change profile to ""Daughter"" account. Then I could say, Alexa, turn on TV, and she would.

5,"Devyn Hart","January 4, 2017","What a great idea, and excellent execution! The idea that I can make a shopping list, or set an alarm, without interrupting my thought process to find some paper, or pull out my phone, is great! I'm jumping on to the wagon a little late, but the Echo Dot is very easy to use, and has tutorials and instructions to help you learn how to use Alexa's voice recognition properly. You can set dates or reminders in your calendar, and with the many skills currently out, and the ability to make your own (if you have the time and so desire) there really are infinite possibilities as to what Alexa can help you do; want to know how long your chicken has been in the freezer? There is a skill for that. Can't decide which workout you want to do today? There is a skill for that. Is the surf good this morning? Alexa can tell you. Forgot to shut off the lights down stairs? Alexa will do it for you (""The Clapper"" on steroids). I saw a really great story about a man completely bed ridden and unable to move. He was given the Dot as a gift and now has ""someone"" to talk with and play games. The doctor's even noticed an improvement in his overall health and mood since having received the gift. The Echo Dot has amazing potential.Really the only draw back I have found is that unlike its larger, more expensive counter-part, the Dot must always be plugged in to use. There has been a battery attachment developed that gives you about 6-8 hours of life (depending on usage), but if you find a good home for her to live it shouldn't be a problem for most. Also, if you will probably need one per room depending on floor layout and acoustic variables.open layouts may be able to utilize one for multiple rooms. Considering the price for one, though, even 2 or 3 wont break the bank, especially compared with all the other devices we use now.",0.705882352941177,"positive"

I'm amazed at all it can do and it's ability is just getting started. I added Hue lights a week ago and already cannot imagine life without it. I always struggled to turn on/off my bedside light because the switch was way up inside the shade. Not an issue at all now. I gave three of them to three different households for Christmas. Only one was leary of it but they were on board once I set it up and started showing its ability. I'm looking forward to my house getting more voice controlled. Be aware, if it's in range of your TV and the Amazon Alexa commercial comes on, it will react!!!  I think my dad is really entertained by that part!!",0.6,"positive"
2,"Adrian","January 27, 2017","This is a slightly useful device. It's ok for asking web search info items , like weather or scores, and a few other things.I had a lot of problems connecting to it initially, becuase I use 2-factor authentication on my account and by the time I had gone to my authenticator app and got a code, returned to Alexa app and gone through the login process again, the code expired. I had to turn off 2-factor on my account, and even then it made me do a capcha that was complicated by the fact that the app won't scroll, so I was typing in the capcha field blind. Thanks for the frustration, Alexa. I have secure physical possession of both devices, why can't the process be much easier?I have a Harmony hub for AV control, and Alexa can use it. Once again, connection problems abound, as the Alexa app insisted that I didn't have a Harmony hub, even though the Harmony app is on the very same phone that Alexa app is on. Eventually I was successful. Then came the sad discovery that all it can do is turn AV gear on and off. There went my dream of tuning my dvr by voice command. More frustration.So then I linked my Spotify account to have it play thru bluetooth speakers. This works, but every time I return to play music again, I have to manually make spotify use the bluetooth speakers, as it defaults to using the Dot speaker. Haven't found a work-around yet. Thanks for nothing, Alexa.As far as simple voice commands, it works about 80% of the time. Sometimes it ignores me, sometimes it whines about the internet connection. I live in a rural neighborhood that's not too badly wifi congested. My cell phone stays connected anywhere on my property but Alexa struggles from a 30 foot distance to my wifi router. It randomly announces when it connects to the wifi or bluetooth. It reacts to what it hears on TV sometimes(yes I have done the voice training), which leads to baffling announcements. I say 'Alexa, shut up"" a lot.In summary, this would be a good deal at $19. Too bad it cost $50.  I'll keep it, but it doesn't really do anything my Nexus 6 won't do with the ""OK Google"" function. Amazon is a major cloud provider, why can't they put a good web app up for connecting and configuring and linking?I can't recommend this device unless you are a 'smart home' hobbyist who wants to spend money linking it to Zwave or Zigbee devices.UPDATE: I decided to keep this and use it as a voice commanded search engine for simple questions, but its results have been poor. I will be returning it as being nearly useless to me.When it failed to answer a question, I repeated the question to Ok Google on my phone, and in all cases it was able to answer. Here are some of those questions:1. When was the piano invented?2. Who was Field Marshal von Rundstedt?3. What is maximum allowed length of a golf club?I'm not interested in using this as am Amazon shopping tool, which it is probably good at. I'm sending it back.",0.484848484848485,"negative"

I think it has trouble connecting to WIFI networks that have a web page verification. We are talking about a university network that works well for everything else. It connected, but it would fall of the network. Finally, I gave up and I took it home in Marcy 2017, thinking that I would set up it there. Took a while. I was pretty disappointment until I realized that the Alexa server was down. While I was figuring this out, I looked into the warranty.  Have you tried to visit the Amazon warranty page?

3,"Lee M.","February 12, 2017","I think it's only worth 3 stars as it's okay but not that great.  I bought it just for home automation, to control my Hue lights and HomeSeer as well as Lutron Caseta.  She works maybe 70% of the time, otherwise you have to repeat yourself.  Many times you'll say ""Alexa, turn on the living room lamp"" and she'll say ""Okay!"" and then nothing happens.  Take out the Hue app on my phone and it turns on instantly.  If you have the TV on or any music then she almost never hears you.  I bought 4 of them to spread around the house for the best coverage but they don't seem to interact.  Meaning sometimes I'll be upstairs standing 10 feet away from one, and I'll say Alexa, but it will be the Dot 1 floor down that responds instead.The other issue I have is she is totally brain dead compared to Google.  Most questions I ask she responds with ""Sorry I'm having trouble understanding what the question was.""  Even for basic things as well.  She's supposed to give you info on stores etc but never does either. I'll say ""Alexa, when does Best Buy close today?"" and she'll reply ""Cincinnati Zoo is open until 6pm today.""The other huge issue I have is that while she supports lots of 3rd party skills, triggering them is not intuitive.  For example, I use HomeSeer for my home automation controller in the house.  While I can say ""Alexa, turn this or that on or off"" and it works, anything more complex with HomeSeer you need to use the HomeSeer skill.  So instead it's ""Alexa, tell HomeSeer to turn on the alarm.""  or ""Alexa, tell harmony to increase the TV volume.""  When it really should just be ""Alexa, turn up the TV volume.""It has potential, I think it will be interesting in a few years, but right now it's more gimmicky.",0.652173913043478,"positive"

I use them like most folks, I supposed, to control my Lifx lights, Nest and to play music. Generally, it's working very well in all respects, and I look forward to seeing the skills expand. One thing that should change: When you plug the audio out into an external speaker, the device's own internal speaker stops working altogether. In my opinion, when you use the external audio port, Alexa's voice should still come through the device's own speaker for feedback. I use one of these with my stereo for music and I don't have it on constantly. So, if my stereo isn't on and I ask Alexa to turn on the lights, I don't hear any feedback.",1,"positive"
5,"aHungerArtist","January 19, 2017","I ended up having to buy this from a major retailer over Christmas because they were so backordered by the time I was ready to buy! When Amazon products go on sale make sure to act faster than I did!I had originally given this to my tween, who was not so impressed! She loves her headphones and usually streams underground pop music mixes from YouTube, as opposed to mainstream type music that gets air play. I'm assuming Alexa doesn't do YouTube since I think that kind of app would be beside the point for a speaker.I ended up putting it in the kitchen where my mom ""lives"" and the radio is playing, mostly commercials, most of the day and night. I gave my mom quick, basic, instructions. My mom has 0 technology experience and even less willingness to learn. She's the type who won't even touch a laptop to move it out of the way because she's afraid she will break it by touch lol.Anyway, by the end of the day she had it down pat. Someone was always kind of close to help if they heard her getting flustered with Alexa.The main learning curve she had was timing, First you say ""Alexa,"" then as her blue ring lights up you give command. Once this was clear it was very helpful. One of our big issues is giving her tmi before she's ready to process.Our other issue was timing. If you take too long Alexa will play a station for you based on previous requests or key words she captured from your request.Our final barrier was being clear with commands. A few times we had to remind her to give the wake word first, or give a command. I would get her yelling, ""skip!"" forgetting to first wake Alexa, or, very fast in trying to get all her information to Alexa (wake word, song title and artist) and forgetting to give ""play"" command.Another note. It was not so apparent to her at first, when the kitchen is busy and noisy, Alexa is hearing everything and can get confused by the noise. Still she sometimes thinks that Alexa will obey as long as she's yelling loud enough, which is often pretty loud when she is being louder than a gregarious family...*eta* I also wanted to add that I did not take the time to voice train Alexa on initial setup. Had I done this perhaps her learning curve would have been less steep but I had kind of forgotten to do it until my daughter reminded me about it.Now that she's used to Alexa she is beyond stoked! She was also excited to find that Alexa knows some of her favorite Spanish singers. Apparently Alexa knows a bit of Spanish (and my parents get a kick out of her gringo iterations of the song titles).My kids love to share their favorite songs with their grandparents, and often there is an impromptu pop song and dance show in the kitchen :-) My parents love to share songs with them too, my son is always asking Alexa for Neil Young and smooth jazz nowadays, learning all of yesterday's hits :-) this stuff is priceless.And a note on size: I was worried at first that the sound would be lost in the big, noisy, kitchen. Sometimes it is lol. It is just as loud as her old 90's portable stereo. You know the kind. Alexa is just as loud. When the house is on the calmer side I can hear her music all the way upstairs. So although it's not Beats, don't let the size and price fool you!Thanks Amazon, for this great and very accessible little device. I have no doubt that it has enhanced and intensified the amount of happiness in this house!",0.560975609756098,"positive"

5,"Gadgit Tech","December 8, 2016","First thoughts, Echo Dot was easy to setup with either a smart phone or computer.I switched to the computer as it was just easier on the eyes.Good voice control once you get the hang of it and the method used for commands.Echo Dot is small and easy to place in a location where one unit can cover a large area.Integration with a current home automation system was simple using the skills already available and well document between both Amazon and my HA system (in my case HomeSeer).Con's so far: NO 24 hour clock? I hate having to say, hear or read AM and PM, and the Echo Dot does not support this yet!I got this to uses with my current home automation system due to other devices (hardware failures) having an issues!I impressed by the simple commands (VR) that allow me to be hands free to operate my lights and systems and the other Echo functions are a plus such as checking news, traffic and playing my own library of music.The Echo has so many skills sets already available that it will take some time before I discover what all it can do besides what I have already tried, but for 50 dollars I can see using the Echo Dot rather than replace or install other HA devices that need to be replaced or installed due manufacture defect and or failure in my system, I can save on deployment and cost of those devices as well. So I might end up with some HA spares, which is always a good thing.Note: If you happen to use HomeSeer HA you will need version HS3, HSTouch-with account and also make certain HS3 setup under the network page - remote control settings is CHECKED for JSOM. It took me a bit to figure out that this needed to be checked for remote access for this to work.Not related to the Echo -HS3 Running on Lenovo M73 Tiny with Win7 Pro45 Insteon, 78 Events, 157 DevicesPLM module via InsteonPlugins: Insteon 3.0.6.0, HSTouch 3.0.0.68, UltraMon3, weatherXMLHSTouch Clients: 3 Androids",0.722222222222222,"positive"

I've had it for a while and hooked up WINK and NEST to it, now my home is like a spaceship. I think it's funny that people were selling these on eBay for 250$ thinking they were ""cancelled"". It's a great product and a home run for Amazon. there are some ""language"" things that could be improved, some of the people developing the ""skills"" (which work like apps) are lacking basic English expectations for sentence formation, (for example, saying Alexa, where are my keys should work, but instead you have to say ""Alexa, ask the app [name] to find my keys"" which is award). That I suspect will improve in time.There is some great developer humor and 'easter eggs' in the Alexa system, for example, ask Alexa ""What is the meaning of life?"" or ask ""Open the pod bay doors"" and you'll get a surprise. As long as Amazon continues to listen to customers this will be a fantastic product for years to come. Excellent example of ""machine puppetry mimicking human behavior"".Would be nice if I could ask ""Alexa, list albums in my music"" or ""list artists starting with letter T"" or ""list my audio books""... I keep sending feature requests, hint* to anyone else who thinks thats a good idea, send a request in!Only 1 BAD thing: the Android ""app"" font sizes are off and overlap essential UX components like the SEARCH button... so there are problems using the buttons in Android app (Samsung S4) to control and set skills, but if you have an iPad you are good to go...(For fun I named my thermostat ""the weather"")Cheers!",0.75,"positive"

You get the first layer who asks standard questions and if they can't solve it you go to the second layer in which you explain everything all over again.  The reps were nice enough, sometimes hard to understand their English, but I do believe they were trying to be helpful.  My biggest issue is how many customer service people I have talked to in order to get my dot working.  Amazon shipped me another new dot and I set it up.  It answered questions, but did not play songs.  What are the chances of getting two defective dots and they had different issues.  I had to call again and get two layers of representatives, explaining all of it over again.  This was hours on the phone and even though the rep tried hard to help, he had to finally give up and send the issue to the engineers.  Then, because I had two dots, I did not get my free 30 day unlimited music trial.  I was charged immediately so I had to call customer service again!  Two more reps to get that straightened out.

We have only had them for a little over a week now, but we are having a good time using our voice now!  I will say that buying more than one at a time can be challenging come setup time, they are automatically on your account once bought so when you hook the first one up, you have to guess at which one is the correct one.  If it doesn't sync, then you have to start over and pick another one from the Alexa setup app.Since they have been installed I only have Alexa waking me up for work and haven't used the alarm clock since.  It's so nice in the morning when she goes off to just say ""Alexa, snooze"" instead of trying to find it on the alarm clock hoping you don't hit the water on the night stand!  We installed our first skill, My Chef, but that one didn't really do what we wanted so now we are using OurGroceries and like that one much better.  We also bought a TP-Link WiFi bulb and works perfectly with Alexa, now that we are getting accustomed to things, we just bought another bulb and a switch and 2 smart plugs, all TP-Link because the idea of not needing a hub and connects directly to our router was a big plus.  And how well the first bulb has worked.  I was also able to easily connect Alexa to our Denon receiver via bluetooth with no issues.  Now that it is paired, we just turn our Denon receiver to bluetooth, say ""Alexa, pair bluetooth"" then I say ""Alexa, play mix playlist"" and plays my amazon music playlist through the Denon speakers and we LOVE this!

The one in the main room we use for music, timers, weather, and the one in the bedroom we use for waking us up, playing rain music while we sleep etc. Can't wait to use Uber on it and link it to our smart switches and smart thermostat. Can't beat the price for this hub. Prefer the echo dot over the larger one since most people would prefer listening to music through their sound system anyways.I like how you can turn the volume down and up, but I wish they made it easier than saying ""ALEXA LOUDER"" and ""ALEXA QUIETER"" it usually takes me a few ""ALEXAS"" to get the volume the way I want it. Maybe there is an easier way I just haven't found out yet.Also wish ALEXA had the capability to turn off an on my bluetooth speaker. Seems like our speaker has to always be on in order for ALEXA to use it. If there is a way to turn it off and on with voice control someone please let me know.I am sure that ALEXA will only get more awesome as updates occur, but it still deserved 5 stars even with the little kinks it has.

AWESOME.the only sad thing is that due to security issues they will not let alexa communicate to the garage door opener or the door locks that are automated. i have an ""away mode"" that turns off my lights and opens the garage door when i am leaving - but alexa cannot do this since it has the garage door attached.also, it has a headphone jack on the back so i set this in the living room next to the surround sound and plugged it in the aux port and we leave the speaker on all the time. now we say ""play spotify"" and it will play on the surround sound. she also works wiht bluetooth speakers but we dont have a wall powered bluetooth yet.its also nice that it works wiht my shared grocery list OurGrocereis app so we can add items easily when we are making dinner etc.i dont see why people need a ton in their house.with my open floorplan and 1700 sf, we only need one. we yell down the hallway when going to bed ""alexa, all off!"" and all the lights go out haha. well maybe we mgiht want one in the master bedroom....:-)",0.727272727272727,"positive"
5,"Andrew V","December 13, 2016","Awesome gadget. The Dot is one of those things that you wouldn't ever NEED, but once you have it you question how you ever got by without it.The Good:1. Great for DJing, entertaining, or for your audiobooks...provided you pay extra for the various services needed to make those functions work well.2. Myriad of organizational features are super handy, especially since I work from home. To do list and calendar sync are useful, I am much less likely to forget to set an appointment when I can just shout at Alexa to make it for me. Weather, currency/distance/time zone converting saves me a lot of random googling.3. Surprisingly good at picking up commands from long distances despite background noise. Can hear and acknowledge commands even when I yell from in the shower.4. Easy integration with new devices, I didn't have any trouble setting several bluetooth speakers up as well as a LIFX bulb. Setting up the LIFX bulb was a pain, but Alexa found it immediately.5. The Dot is one of those devices that makes you think ""the future is now.""The Bad:1. To really get your money's worth out of it, you pretty much need a music service or audible subscription.2. You have to be very precise with your commands, Alexa isn't that great at decoding some requests. In the end, it's not a big deal, Alexa kind of ""trains"" you.3. No built in battery4. The Dot is so useful that I now angrily lament that more devices aren't voice activated.The Ugly:1. It's small and innocuous, no major complaints about the design or look.2. The volume ring is not really persistently useful as it only appears when you're adjusting the volume. Pretty much means you have to remember where you left the volume.3. I can't change the wake word to ""Computer"" to fully realize my dream of being on the Star Trek Enterprise",0.733333333333333,"positive"
5,"AHJ42","January 20, 2017","Great fun but effective.  I have thoroughly enjoyed the last fortnight, first with one, then two, and now four echo dots.The first communicates with my sonos connect, and allows me, via the sonos app to ask for playlists and music in any zone. It will be nice when sonos and Amazon get their act together and allow me to ask for music in any zone without using the app, or delving into what is now years old programming in order to ask sonos to play any playlist, album or song.Alexa talks to my hive system, and not only boosts my heating, but allows me to control and dim lights in several zones, and even switch off one of the two lights in my bedroom on the same switch, which shines in my eyes when I am reading in bed.I am now putting a Logitech hub in place to control various electrical outlets.The second dot is connected to a pair of speakers in my bedroom, but still allows me to control heat and lights.The third echo is connected to my portable foxl speakers, and allows me to stream music in any internet accessible location, including friends and family's houses, and hotels. I can't wait to show this portable system off to my friends at our next reunion. Is there a link to allow friends purchases to allow discounts on my digital purchases?The last dot is attached to the sound system at my girlfriend's place, which not only allows me to listen to my prime music at her place, but also can change the crappy music she plays to something sensible even When I am miles away😇I have yet to explain to her how to turn my heating or lighting in at my home, but I can do this from a distance, to annoy or distract unwanted visitors 😂In summary, a bit clunky, but full of potential",0.6,"positive"
5,"DrunkTown","December 7, 2016","Black Friday came and went. Like me, you may have decided to hold off on the retail kayos opting to spend your day browsing Amazon instead of suffering through the large crowds. One of the gadgets that caught my eye was the Amazon Echo dot. It is basically a scaled down version of the larger wireless Amazon Echo. It was on sale for only $40, so I decided to give it a try. By Monday morning it had arrived.First things first, one of my favorite movies growing up was Smart House. I'm a huge fan of Home Automation and the smart home life. I had seen the Echo before, but not being a huge fan of Siri I figured it was just more of the same. That being said this thing is pretty darn cool.Getting Started:The Echo dot is extremely easy to setup. You download the Alexa app (Alexa is the echo dot interface, like Siri) pair it with your WiFi and you are up and running. It took about 5 minutes. The dot wakes when you say Alexa. You can then ask it basic questions about the weather, or give commands like ""turn on the lights"" if you have existing smart technologies. Through the back-end you can make Alexa smarter by enabling specific skills.Favorite ThingsGames: My wife and I love playing Jeopardy. The dot has a built in game that asks six questions updated daily. They are related to actual game categories that aired that day, but entirely different questions.Smart Accessories: If you purchase a smart switch, you can enable the dot to turn on and off your lights with a simple command. Since it is daylight savings time this is pretty awesome.Audio Playback: Audible books, music library, podcasts, ect are a simple command away from playback. Really useful.Making the home smarter is the trend this holiday season and it is only going to become more advanced in the near future. The echo dot is an entry level piece of technology that is a more convenient, and frankly a more useful version of Apple's Siri. Alexa doesn't know the answers to everything. It can be frustrating repeating yourself and rephrasing specific questions to try and get an answer. Nevertheless, when paired with a smart thermostat like Nest it can really make your home life more pleasant. After only a week, I bought four more!",0.88,"positive"
5,"Richard Stone","January 9, 2017","I love this little hockey puck speaker. Personally, I think they should have called it the Amazon Echo Puck. I suppose that might have been too Shakespearian. Anyway, it does everything it promises to do, and much more than I expected.It has no problem understanding me at all, which is more than I can say for telemarketers whom I instruct to never, never, ever call me again. I can call out its name from anywhere in my 5 room home, and it responds immediately. It even hears me when I'm in my bedroom with the speaker speaking loudly away next to my ear.It does so much. Some say another he-who-shall-not-be-named brand does more. I beg to differ with you, Some! Add in some skills and ITTT scripts, and it does everything I want and more. For instance, I use ""My Grocery"" with the corresponding skill, and it works great keeping me supplied with supplies for the above mentioned meager meals.To Echo or to Puck, I mean, Dot? The Echo has a good speaker built in, but the Dot, combined with a speaker, such as the one I purchased from Papa Amazon, Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 Next Generation Ultra Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker : Louder Volume 10W+, More Bass, Water Resistant, Perfect Speaker for Golf, Beach, Shower & Home (Black), is cheaper than buying the Echo and will provide good sound and portability. The Puck, aka Dot, is also less visibly intrusive having a much small footprint.The, uh, ok, Dot, will do so much more, including Hal-like control of most everything in my home, though I am not yet using it this way. It would be worth the price for me solely for controlling music and my shopping and ToDo lists. Thanks, Amazon, you done good!",0.705882352941177,"positive"

There is clear midrange and highs are present so the music is enjoyable through her.

5,"gardener97","November 17, 2016","OMG - I want one in every room. You can think of any song you ever heard, ask Echo (or Alexa, you decide on the name) to play it and there it is - a real trip down memory lane or up to date new. This little Dot speaker is OK. No it is not the Bose Mini, but it is OK. (I actually have the Bose Mini in the bedroom) and if you have a second Dot in the kitchen you can just let the Dot speaker play and it is not bad. I LOVE being able to say ""Echo put appliance bulbs on the shopping list"" and next time I'm at the grocery, there it is on my list. I don't have to think about going to write something down. Questions? Yeah, you say"" Echo how old is Ruth Bader Ginsburg?"" and Echo says ""83, she was born..."" and you can either listen to the rest or say ""Echo stop"".There is a to-do list too. ""Echo, put oil change on the to do list"".  If you need to have more than 2 lists, you can get some 3rd party apps to build more lists.Skills: skills are like apps gone crazy. Like Skill Meow actually meows and drives your cat nuts. Tons of skills.You can build a huge library of playlists and music. You can upload your own music or if you are a prime member, there are about a jillion songs out there just waiting for you. You have to download the Alexa app and the Amazon music app. The music app is a bit squirrelly (to me) and I find building playlists on my computer works better than on the iPhone or the iPad. You need to be in the right place though - this url is gold! that would be music dot amazon dot com - and build away.Echo/Dot will also read your audible books to you, picking up wherever you last left off and you can say 'echo, back up a minute' or whatever too.Also you can just say “Echo, play some Mozart” and she will start right in. Or just say play classical, or smooth jazz or 60s rock. She will pull them off the huge amazon library. Once in a while she won’t have a song you want but I find if I say it again, or say it putting the artists name either in the front or the back of the request, she will find it. Also you can see your queue on the Alexa app so you can skip around.And she can tell you jokes. Not terribly good jokes if you are over 9 but cute.",0.8125,"positive"
5,"Jake","December 14, 2016","I love the Echo Dot - Alexa is pretty intuitive, and she gets better as you ""learn each other"" - the skills that you can add make it even more useful - I was hesitant to buy this because I figured it was a luxury I didn't really need, but I used someone else's and it was just too good to pass up.The Dot is just like the full fledge Echo, just cheaper - I got this and a cool pair of water speakers for $15 bucks and it works the same. (so $65 total vs. $180) - it's great to have her play whatever radio station you want, particular songs - whatever. (Plus Chuck Norris stuff).Buy it, you won't be sad. Like I said, get a pair of decent speakers with it and you won't be losing anything with the Dot vs. the Echo.",0.823529411764706,"positive"

4,"A. Falco","December 1, 2016","I bought a full-sized echo and my Dot at the same time. Setup them both up without issue. Having used both, though, I'm convinced that I've either got a Dot that's working a little wonky, or the Dots aren't quite up to the same quality level as the Echo.For example, my Dot frequently ""listens"" in the wrong direction. The echo *always* indicates it is listening in the direction that I'm standing/sitting. The Dot will usually point the opposite direction. (They are both equidistant from the wall, so that shouldn't be affecting things.) Additionally, Dot will often continue listening for up to 10 seconds after I've stopped talking - even in an otherwise silent room. It's as if it's still hearing me talk, even though there's no speaking (or appliances on, etc - near completely silent).Also, the Dot has lost connection several times where the Echo has had zero problems in that regard. They're both quite close to wifi, so that shouldn't be an issue.Anyway, these concerns aside, it's overall a great device within its narrow realm of ""can do"". Ironically, the more I realize it *can* do, the more painful it is that so many opportunities are unrealized. For example, I love the Flash Briefings. But, I find myself wishing I could get Alexa to read headlines and have me say ""stop, read that full article"". But, this is not meant to be. At least not yet. Another example would be the fact that Alexa can't resume podcasts. Fine for 4 minute ones, but a huge pain when most of the podcasts on your list are in the realm of 1.5 hours. I don't really consider this missed opportunities, I rather imagine that they're things that will be added at some point. At least I hope that's the case. (Also tighter phone integration - sending texts, etc.) Still, for what it is, it's great. I love going home and asking for Christmas music, etc. Very happy with the purchase.",0.470588235294118,"negative"

4,"S. Holmes","January 8, 2017","I purchased an Echo Dot because I liked that I could hook it up to speakers using 3.5 mm instead of a Bluetooth connection like my phone.  I also use Siri a lot for different random things around the house but I have to have my phone with me as Siri doesn't really pick me up if I leave the immediate area, so the Echo Dot seemed like a pretty great solution to me.The Echo Dot works fairly well at picking me up from across the room even with music playing.  If the music is too loud the Dot won't hear me but I currently have the Dot sitting right next to my speakers so I could probably have a better set up as well.  I haven't really had any trouble with Alexa being able to understand anything I've said.Alexa seems pretty capable but one feature I'd like to see are customized timers or alerts, for example I can set an alarm at 8PM, or I can add something on my to-do list, but as far as I've found I can't get Alexa to remind me to do something at 8PM.  This is pretty basic feature that I use a lot with Siri.I'm an Amazon Music user so I figured the two would be fairly heavily integrated.  Unfortunately the music search capabilities from within the Alexa app are almost non-existent (I only have the ability to find playlists).  For example, I asked Alexa to play the acoustic version of Elastic Heart by Sia, but Alexa will only play the regular version.  In the app on the iPhone or PC, I've found no way to be able to search for the Acoustic version and play it without adding it to a playlist.All in all, I really enjoy the Echo Dot and with some enhancements I think Alexa could be pretty great.  I enjoy the Dot enough that I bought a second one for the bedroom.",0.814814814814815,"positive"

Some examples where this lets me down. at my brothers place I asked the OTHER companies version of this Will Tony Romo start at quarterback and the unit gave me a perfect answer and knew what I was asking.we asked his echo the same thing and it kept getting the I do not understand answer. asked the question different ways and same response.WHen I got home I asked my echo the same thing and it had no idea what I was asking either. The other brand also understands follow up questions better and understands the flow of the conversation where echo does not seem intuitive enough to do this.another example is that I ask my echo to play songs from Frankie Valle, it does not understand. i asked it several ways, added Four Seasons to the name, no matter how I asked it it said it could not find songs and wanted me to link it to a paid service such as spotify etc. Keep in mind that I have the amazon unlimited music. here is the weird part, If I ask it to play Dawn or big girls dont cry etc by Frankie Valle it finds them and will play the songs if I tell it the name of the song but not if I ask it to play songs by Frankie Valle. if you cant remember the name of every song its pointless.asked it for directions and it pointed me to some app. The other brand did not do this and gave directions.  not really impressed with this unit.

4,"Adaliz","December 24, 2016","1/3/2017 Edit:Already found something REALLY annoying. The Alexa Dot has NO INTERNAL BATTERY. I don't mind leaving it connected but I wanted to take it between the bedroom and the kitchen and for one 1) You have to carry the charger with it- which is not horrible if 2) it wasn't for the fact that when you disconnect and reconnect, Alexa doesn't always quickly and/or seamlessly connect back to the Wi-Fi once online.  Couple days ago, I took it from the bedroom to kitchen to listen Amazon Music only to have to play with the Alexa App and the Dot for an hour to get it online. I'm leaving the review at four stars- but again I think this could become tiresome.  Also, be sure to setup the settings and download some skills, because it won't always pick up what you're saying and sometimes it's because the ""skill"" required for this has not been installed. Managed to connect my Google Calendar to my wall and it finds my Amazon Music and Audible without issue- for now.--Original Review--Liking it so far, setup was pretty easy (make sure you're entering your Wi-Fi password correctly. We thought ours was broken and the Wi-Fi password was just being entered incorrectly).I have had bad experiences with Amazon Devices (yet I keep supporting them- go figure). My first Kindle 3G stop working withing the year, my Kindle Fire still works fine (though it is sometimes slow), and my Amazon Fire Phone was a disaster that I had to exchange FOUR TIMES!! So, I'm approaching the Dot with hope but low expectations. This one was a gift. I'm hoping this device simplicity makes it lasts a long time.Setup is easy, you use the Alexa app on your phone or tablet. I use prime music and was able to tell to play my music quickly. If you have all your stuff linked up. Should be a breeze. Great concept for $39.",0.565217391304348,"positive"
5,"BuyItOnce","November 3, 2016","The first Echo system seemed like an expensive toy and questionably expensive for just another music speaker. All that has changed in pretty much the span of a year; Alexa skills have grown quite a bit to control other services and hardware, and the echo hardware costs have come down significantly with the 2nd gen Dot.Seems like the Echo is ready for prime time mass adoption with a maturing eco system, and this is when I decided to try it out. By itself, the echo service can tell you the weather, news, play music, search the internet, set alarms/timers. Useful, but nothing your phone can't already do via either OK Google or Siri for the most part or a few taps manually. If your habits in these activities are already ingrained, you're not likely to change them to use Echo.The real value and use case winner is in how fast and easy the echo ecosystem integrates with other services and hardware for home automation and control. The Echo ecosystem is vastly easier and cheaper to implement home automation than competing offerings; unless you're already committed to Smarthings, Wink, Iris, etc. and love/able to tinker with z wave or x10. If the hardware of your choice has a mobile app, chances are it's already compatible with Echo or will be since the extent of integration needed is mostly an account linking between the services.So what have I been able to automate for less than $400 total so far?HardwareSensi smart thermostat - set specific temp for each thermostatLogitech Hub-- turn on/off tv or each componentTp Link smart plugs --turn on/off air cleaner, dehumidifier, fan, or space heaterI'm sure there are better Z wave and X10 solutions that can do this too, but each of these only took minimal set up to install and enable.On the services side, being able to integrate with Spotify is amazing. I can rattle off whatever song or playlist I want to hear and it plays from spotify.A typical night in the kitchen now usually involves playing some music from Spotify while cooking, turning on the TV and sound bar, set a higher temp if it's cold. Turn things off again while dinner is being served, turn on space heater or air cleaner as we gradually move upstairs for the night.Just practical voice controlled home automation with minimal investment cost.It's not all perfect though, just because it's easy to link services doesn't mean they always work together flawlessly. There were a few times where Echo acknowledged a music request but nothing played. I've come to learn that Spotify has issues maintaining a long list of Spotify connect devices; some of my devices just drop from their list from time to time. Amazon can't fix this, since it's really a Spotify issue but it does chip away at the overall Echo experience.Logitech integration has worked great so far but Logitech has only invested minimally at this point, I can only turn things on/off, still need the remote or my phone to control volume.The smart plugs work fine with the stock Kasa app but echo has been unable to turn on the fan a few times with no apparent reason why. I can only suspect that there was some problem with the account link in the background.While Echo is quick to connect with these services, it's up to each service owner how well they support functionality and that is likely the biggest catch and watchout for the Echo home automation ecosystem.There's a ton of additional potential for cost effective and easy expansion to include anything that has a Wifi app; lights, door locks, garage doors. But it will all leave a bad taste if the supported functionality is minimal from each vendor.For now, it remains cost effective even for existing functionality and the future is yet bright for more to come.",0.767441860465116,"positive"

4,"S. Jones","October 24, 2016","This is a great entry level echo. Personally I like the regular echo better for certain reasons, but other people may have the exact opposite thoughts so read on. Note I bought a portable battery for my regular echo so it is fully portable so keep that in mind while reading this. The battery cost about ~$50 so add that to the $179 of the regular echo.Pros:- The Dot is awesome at $49. A steal.- You can use your own Bluetooth speaker. I have a Bose Mini Soundlink and it sounds great.- Does everything the $179 echo can, with the exception of sound good, at a fraction of the price.Cons:- Internal speaker is poor. If you want it for music you need a good Bluetooth speaker = more cost.- The mic seems less sensitive than regular echo. No science to back this up, just my impression. I feel like I repeat myself more with the Dot.- When I have a Bluetooth speaker connected, if I say ""stop music"" it stops. Then I turn my speaker off.  The Dot starts playing again?  I have to turn the speaker off, wait a second for the audio to kick in on the dot, then tell dot to stop music.  Both ways should work, shouldn't they?- Less immersive sound than regular Echo. The Bose Mini is directional.  If you are in front of the speaker it sounds great. Move to the sides and it looses some umph. While the regular Echo speaker doesn't sound as good as the Bose in optimal settings, because the regular Echo projects sound from all around it tends to fill a room better (while working in a garage or taking a shower for example)Both are great deals, Dot is cool, just some differences to keep in mind and get what best meets your needs.UPDATE:OK with the Bluetooth speaker and stopping music issue I reference above, these are the steps I have to take to stop playing music and disconnect the speaker:1. Say ""Echo, disconnect my speaker"". (Note sometimes she gets confused and thinks I want to connect another speaker so I have to do this twice)2. Once the speaker disconnects and music is now coming from Dot speaker, I say ""Echo, stop music""Again, if I stop the music then disconnect the speaker, Dot just starts playing music again.Update 2: I moved my larger echo to the bedroom and put the Dot where larger echo used to be in the kitchen. A couple times per day I would get a ""sorry your Dot has lost connection"" messages from it while interacting with it. At first I thought it was defective, but I ended up moving it about 20 feet closer to the wifi router. Problem is now gone. Thus the range on the Dot is not as good as the regular echo.",0.714285714285714,"positive"

4,"handicapped shopper","November 12, 2016","I just set up my Dot, and I like it quite a bit.  I just wish I knew more about using it. I want to set my alarms to wake me with music, but, after contacting Amazon, I found that you can't do that.  It also can't access my iPad calendar, so I can't ask if I have any appointments coming up. Amazon suggested an add on feature, but that didn't work, either.I've had the Dot for over a week now and found it to be fun and useful, except when I ask it a question.  The answer I most often get is that she doesn't know the answer to that question.  I find that annoying.  Amazon help is there for you, but, after adding my new Phillips Hue lights, etc.  Amazon says I need to reboot my Dot to get it to answer my questions.  The first rep told me to unplug it and replug, and assured me that nothing would be lost.  The second rep told me to reboot, reconnect it to my WiFi and reregister with Amazon. THAT is REALLY annoying.  I sent a reply asking if that would require me to reconnect my Hue hub and lights.  I think the answer will be yes.  Annoying.I was also told to use the voice recognition feature to train it to understand my voice.  Hmmm, it understands almost everything I say, and Siri understands me perfectly.  So......  I think it just didn't understand the words poinsettia and hallucinogenic.  Looking at the text of my questions in the app, Alexa understood me perfectly most of the time.  She just couldn't answer.But, having said that, the Dot is new technology and Amazon is updating it all the time.  So, I'm relatively sure that these issues will be fixed.It's doing a good job of giving me the weather, playing the music I request, and telling me kid friendly jokes.  It's doing a good job with turning my lights on and off, too, now that I set up my Philips Hub.So, I look forward to using my Dot a lot in the future.  I love being able to use my voice to get things done and find information.  Great gadget for the elderly and disabled.",0.6875,"positive"
5,"Coffee Hound","January 31, 2017","As an owner of the Amazon Echo, the less expensive alternative Dot was a great addition to carry ""Alexa"" convenience to additional rooms in my house.  The main difference from the Echo is the obvious... size.  So what's missing.  The amazing speaker array but the dot can connect via blue-tooth to an external speaker system.  That means you can pick the quality and size of speakers you want if you find the internal speaker inadequate.  There is one feature that the Dot has that Echo doesn't.  There is a earbud/headphone jack which will allow private listening.  There are four buttons on the Dot.  Two dedicated to up and down volume, one to turn the microphone array off, and a fourth to manually get ""Alexa's"" attention.  While the Echo sounds extremely close to the a Bose Wave (apart, they are hard to distinguish), the Dot, while no where near the Echo, anyone without an Echo will be more than happy and anyone with one, will understand.  It's $50 bucks guys.  Buy five, get one free.Other than the differences mentioned, the functionally and connectivity to WIFI devices and WIFI hubs is the same as Echo.The only minor disappointment in the Amazon family of ""smart speakers"" is that they are limited to only three names you can select for them to answer; Alexa, Amazon or Echo.  All in all, Amazon has done a great job in extending the ""smart"" speaker line and once you look at all the (skills) apps and product support, you really get the feeling that the ""Alexa"" app is growing and is no where near maturity and seems limitless for now.",0.666666666666667,"positive"
5,"penne12","December 2, 2016","It's an awesome way to talk with your technology - want to listen to a song? Just ask Alexa. Just ran out of milk? Just tell Alexa to add it to your shopping list. Need to do something? Alexa will put it on Todoist.Maybe you don't want to pay for Amazon's streaming service - don't worry, you have plenty of other options to listen to music with. You can ask her to play a station on Pandora, a radio station via TuneIn (which is my personal favorite option), a song on Spotify (only Premium, though), or iHeart radio. Don't use any of those? Don't worry, you can connect your phone via Bluetooth and play a song.You can plug your speakers into your Echo Dot. It's an easy and cheap way to upgrade your existing sound system. I love it for connecting both my phone and my computer to my desk speakers, and making it easy to switch between devices.I haven't even talked about how awesome the flash briefing is - you get to hear a customized list of sources tell you the news. I can hear a human anchor from NPR, CNET's tech today product, then listen to the weather. I love it. It's a simple addition, but it removes the friction of having to go and check each source individually. You can hear the news while you go through your morning routine.I even got one for my grandma for her Birthday - she doesn't normally understand tech, but she instantly got it. She loves being able to listen to classical music before she went to bed without having to deal with her phone. She even plans to show it off to her friends when they come over and show how ""tech-y"" she is.Seriously, the uses don't stop there.

5,"mocnozama","January 26, 2017","Given the price, these are great.  I purchased one for myself initially, and additional units for my family members (of varying ages).  Our family has found it very easy to use, very responsive and entertaining.I am surprised at the amount we use the Echo.  A brief list of the favorites are: a) the ""News Briefing,"" which a customizable read-out of the most recent news/stories from a variety of sources; mine is configured to read out NPR's hourly briefing, the local weather forecast and the BBC hourly briefing; b) music on demand by artist/song/genre; c) J!6, the Jeopardy companion app which updates daily and allows you to 'play along' with additional categories from the show; and d) random questions (e.g., how many ounces in a pound, how to spell words, distance to a location, phone number to local businesses, etc.).I follow the competing Google Home fairly closely, and am more invested in Google than Amazon for many tasks (e.g., Calendar, Task List, Email, etc.), which would be of greater use to me day-to-day to have Google integration--however, given the price difference between the Echo Dot and Google Home (at least, currently), I could not recommend the Dot more.I recently changed the 'wake-word' on my Echo's to ""Computer,"" which is somewhat of an emulation of Star Trek's ship computer--although, there is no option to include Majel Barrett's voice (I did, however, change my Echo's to an Australian accent, which, as an American, I find quite pleasing to interact with).

4,"Michael Potts","December 28, 2016","When it works, it's indistinguishable from magic. When it doesn't work, it's frustrating.Since Alexa (impossible not to personify) relies on a robust communication to the internet ... and quickly responsive reactions of the various cloud partners, the frustrations are sporadic. The TP-Link Smart Plugs lose their connections, and so using them for mission critical applications (like entry lighting) can be problematic. Sometimes the problems heal themselves -- a directive to which Alexa fails to respond one minute may be executed perfectly the next. When a plug gets permanently lost, it can usually be unplugged and then plugged back in, and it will resume its former identity ... but not always, and so using a plug in a difficult-to-access location is an invitation for trouble.I wrote my own Flash Briefing cloud service, and with great and attentive help from an Alexa tech, got it working perfectly -- it runs on the Raspberry Pi that control my home's hydronic heating system.This feels like the first generation of a Great Idea -- and we see follow-on products from Google and Apple already -- and so I can only assume that, like the Kindle and Amazon Prime, the idea will mature. My only misgiving is that once one buys in to a compatible technology -- like the Philips hub and lights -- one's committed ""for life"" to that solution, even as better solutions come along. Seymour Papert describes this as ""the Brazil Effect"" -- early adopters often get left behind as a technology matures. And that, in a nutshell, is the story of my life!",0.59375,"positive"

My mom gave me a $50 Amazon gift card for Christmas and this is the best present I have received from her since Patty Play Pal. You are never alone with Alexa around. The echo dot is super easy to set up. All you need is an internet connection and a device to download the Alexa app. From there all things are possible. Signing up for Music unlimited for $3.99 a month is wise and well worth it to get Alexa to play any music you want even down to ""How much is that Doggie in the window."" Alexa will play games with you, tell you jokes, give you the weather report, say goodnight and good morning and be a virtual digital companion. She sometimes is sarcastic and most definitely has a humor. Free apps to use with her abound. She can turn on your lights, tv set, pair with bluetoothe speakers, play sounds to sleep by all night long. She will give you trivia questions and access your calendars and to do lists. I have a 875 foot one bedroom apartment and I can access her from anywhere in it by just speaking. You can buy cases for her but they are not necessary. She is good to go out of the box and for the price of $49.99 she is the best buy I have every made so far. I am elderly and disabled and she helps me so much.

3,"FrostEternal","March 28, 2017","Cool device, not worth $50, I had a gift card for $20, it IS worth $30 plus tax. Amazon needs to step up the game on Alexa - when it works, it works, but much dumber than other AI assistants like Siri or Cortana, and ZERO sense of humor or personality. The skills are cumbersome, music playing support only works well with Amazon music unless you are streaming to it as a bluetooth speaker - which is dumb, as the speaker is not loud enough to hear over an air conditioner.The Alexa platform is VERY open - which is cool BUT it means the available ""Skills"" are mostly very poor quality. For some reason the white Dot still comes with a black power cord, which is just more lack of attention to detail on Amazon's part. Sloppy, sloppy.This is a must-have if you use any home automation - although the setup is VERY CLUNKY - expect hours of set up to get it just right if you want to change light colors or do anything more complex than switching smart devices on or off. There's a terrible interface for adding and forgetting devices in the companion ""app"" -I use the term ""app"" VERY loosely - it's more of a sloppy wrapper on a webpage. Integrating with iOS is spotty at best without lots of workarounds and IFFFT recipes - pretty much essential - and theres no way to program custom words or commands beyond meager smart home groups and Stringify/IFFFT services. Alarms, timers, schedules - all poorly implemented - no way to have Alexa automatically announce reminders or alarms, just one ring tone that is set for all alerts. Commands have very little context and must be given one at a time - no way to say ""Alexa, dim my main lights and turn on the kitchen lights"" - she will just complain that she doesn't understand, or just ignore the command entirely.HOWEVER - despite all these drawbacks I think they will EVENTUALY be ironed out. It's still a cool addition to a geeky home setup and with lots and lots of customization (and maybe even scripting one's own skills) it can be more useful than annoying.Seriously though, Amazon - hurry up.",0.552631578947368,"positive"

I love the easter eggs like the star trek prases and results.It is very customizable to your needs by enabling the available skills on the app. I can use it to order pizza, ask about the weather and traffic, ask it to brief me on the latest news, and it has games like choose your own adventure. I dont think I will be using it to buy anything. Also I do not have smart home items like the phillips hue lights but will probably get some. I like the idea that I can tell it to contol the electronics in the house.I dont have bluetooth speakers but it still was able to hook up to my old logitech speaker system with a cable. I plan on eventually comnecting it to my fire stick to control the TV.It is discreet and functions well. The only downside is for reminders it will only add to a to do list or tell you what you already have on your google calendar. If you want it to tell you agendas on other calendars, you have to import them to your google calendar as it will only use a google calendar. Also alarms can only be set within 24 hours.For the price it is great. It is in my opinion better than the original echo as it is more versatile. It seems to be the gift of the season as most of my family members, including myself, gave them as gifts.It is fun to bond with others who have them.

On the comerial you can ask anything & it finds an answer on a search engine (I assumed they had one that Alexa worked with). But, thats not how it works at all. 9 x's outta 10 it doesn't have an answer. There are certain learning ""bundles"" that you program her w/ to learn, but most of them have nothing to do with why I bought her (I thought I could ask her Warframe questions...it's a video game & she would be able to answer, but since there isn't any gaming ""bundles"", much less warframe, it's nothing like I thought it would be or needed. I thought ok I'll just use it as the Alexa comercial showed, but nope not unless there is a ""bundle"" to teach it 1st. I hope they really take the time to create more general life ""bundles"" or hook it to a search engine that is says the answers outloud not give the answer to ur phone( every question asked goes to the controlling phone!) We can already talk & search our phones thru google. One last thing people should be aware of is that to hook her to outlets to make a smart home...you must have the newest phones out (a 2yr old LG is not good enough). Oh & one last thing, only one person can control it thru their phone, if u try to use more then 1 phone, u have to re-set it all over again!  So it's not what I expected, but I have hope for it, and since I didnt bye the $180 tower which is the same OS as the dot, its only a difference of a 360 speaker, but since I have the Dot, I'm going to keep it & hope it just keeps getting better.",1,"positive"

It connects perfectly with my Phillips Hue lights, GE Link lights, and is a clutch choice for an on demand DJ with Spotify, Pandora, or Prime Music! It's also great for hands free use while you're cooking in the kitchen. You know that one time when that one song you can't stand comes on as soon as you have your hands covered in food? Echo-Dot won't leave you hanging.I mostly use mine for music and light control, and while the on board speaker is great for basic commands, do yourself a favor and hook it up to a Bluetooth speaker for the best experience. Echo-Dot is painless to set up out of the box and can find devices easily. I frequently switch up which Bluetooth speakers I'm using with at with a simple voice command, no additional pairing needed after the very first set up. Being able to purchase things directly from Amazon through Echo-Dot when you're thinking of it or adding items to a shopping list is great feature that I didn't believe I would use, but have come to absolutely love. That's my story with a lot of features, weather, traffic, news briefings, are all things that I thought were neat, but didn't appeal to me.

4,"Robert E. Kleckner","October 26, 2016","About two years ago I started with an Amazon Echo (full size) when they were on sale over a Christmas holiday.  I kept it about a week and returned it because I considered, at the time, that it was just an expensive toy.  About a year later, after reading more and more about what the Echo can do I decided to give it another try so I bought a refurbished Echo from Amazon at a $30 savings and I've been nothing but pleased with it ever since.  It's amazing what Amazon was about to do with it over that short period of time.  I have a 2000 square foot home with a separate home office, family room, kitchen nook, kitchen, master bedroom, etc, and found that this one Echo just wasn't cutting it so, when the new 2nd generation Echo Dot came out, and I read excellent reviews about it on Cnet and other publications, and it was only $49.99, I decided to preorder three of them from Amazon.  I now have an Echo in the family room, the kitchen, my office and the master bedroom and I couldn't be happier.  Even before I got the Dots, I set up my original Echo to control some things around the house. So far I only have been using smart plugs for lamps and certain appliances and everything is working fine.  When I received the Dots and got ready to set them up I realized that Amazon had already registered them to my Amazon account so all I had to do is put them where I wanted them, give them names so I could keep them straight, and connect them to my WiFi.  I had all three of the Dots connected in less than 15 minutes because everything was already done for me before I even received them.  With the new ESP software that Amazon has updated all the Echos with, I have no problems communicating with only one Echo at a time.  The one closest to me is the one that answers my slightest whim.  My next purchase will be the new Ecobee 3 Lite smart thermostat which will be controlled by Alexa.  I'm also experimenting with some ceiling lights, etc, but still deciding exactly which route to take.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with my Echo and Echo Dots.

I would go to the alexa.amazon.com and would click on download and it would bring me to apps page on the Kindle Fire.  The Alexa app would show as Currently Unavailable. As such I could not download it.I had to call Amazon support to figure out how to install this app.  The Rep I spoke with was very helpful.  After his research, the answer was that the Alexa app was not compatible with my Kindle Fire. I then asked for the MAC Address for networks that require it as a security feature. The Rep provided it to me and that worked.My 1st complaint lies in the fact that I purchased the Echo Dots because I read that it was compatible with the Kindle Fire and that it would be easy to install.  I spent over an hour trying to do this and another hour with an Amazon Rep.  After speaking with the Rep,  I. then went back re-read the Echo Dot 2 requirements and it does not say anywhere that the Alexa app would be incompatible with the Kindle Fire.  I ask that Amazon place this information upfront or more prominently because the lack of it has created confusion and wasted my time. Listing them would be helpful.My 2nd complaint is the item comes without any sort of information on the Echo Dot. There is no information like a MAC Address on the box nor inside the box. Had this information been easily found, I would have installed Alexa faster.  In the meantime, I am trying out the Echo Dot.",0.466666666666667,"negative"
2,"On Vacation","February 16, 2017","I received this as a Christmas gift. The device was easy to set up and link to my amazon prime account. Connecting to blue tooth for external speaker was also easy via voice set up. When asking about the weather, time and news, Alexa responds well. However, any questions such as ""what is Russia's main export"" or ""what is plantar fasiitus"" Alexa can not answer. When I ask Google voice the same questions I receive an appropriate answer. There are also skills that can be enabled but unless you ask your skills related question in the required context, Alexa can not answer. I also find it difficult to know which skill I enabled because if the skill it not enabled, Alexa will not be able to answer. I tried the bartender skill, the skill was very limited and if you didn't ask in the correct context, it could not find the amswer, could only suggest basic drinks and always suggested the same when it did. If you asked how to make a drink, more often it could not.  I guess I have look up in the app to see what is and what is not enabled to remember all the skills, not real useful? So in short works great for asking the weather, time and short news summary but I have a phone that does the same thing. I don't see the value in spending $$$ for smart devices (such as $200 for smart lock or $40 for a smart switch or $30 for a light bulb) as I would need to spend hundreds or thousands to achieve a reasonable amount of smart control over key items in the household. In my opinion, not ready for prime time (or the $$).",0.863636363636364,"positive"
4,"Terrapin88","December 31, 2016","The Echo Dot is my first foray into the interesting world of the Internet of Things. I bought my first before Christmas because I was curious about their usefulness. I liked it so much I bought myself anopther one for my bedroom and a thrid that I gave to my brother on Christmas. Currently, I use my Dots to control my LIFX WIFI Color 1000 LED bulbs (which are awesome, btw), my large home stereo system and a smaller clock radio in my bedroom. I like walking into a room and saying ""Alexa, turn on the living room lights to 50%"" and ""Alexa, play relaxing music"". It makes me feel very Star Trek-ish. :) If you are subscribed to a streaming music service like Spotify, Pandora, Tune In, etc. then you have access to literally millions and millions of songs, live radio stations and podcasts that you can listen to by just telling Alexa to play whatever you want. It's so cool.Alexa can do lots of different things by simply enabling any of the tons of skills you'll find on Amazon. The technology isn't perfect just yet, though. While Alexa can hear and understand me pretty well across the room, she can get confused if the music or TV is too loud when you giver her a command. Normally talking louder will do the trick though. While there are a bazillion skills you can enable for free for Alexa, some of the need to be said in a certain way to get Alexa to do what you want. Aside from those two minor gripes, I am definitely enjoying my two Dots, especially for the forty bucks shipped I paid for them. :)",0.666666666666667,"positive"

If there's a problem with Alexa though, it tells you to go to the app. If you need to set something up or change a setting, you need to go to the app - which won't open. And need help? Yup, that's in the app too - which won't open. Even the web browser version won't load sometimes. Even with the newest update to ""fix bugs"" - it won't open.

5,"Parent in Washington, DC area","February 10, 2017","For any parents out there in need of a potty training or bedtime tool, Alexa has become an invaluable trusty sidekick in our household.Use Case 1: Potty Training a toddlerMethod: We planned to try a 5-day potty training method that required us to stay home and put our toddler on the potty every 15 minutes all day long.  When thinking about how to keep myself on a 15 minute timer, I immediately thought of Alexa for one simple reason:Hands Free & Voice Command - No matter what I might be in the middle of during the potty training regimen (cleaning up the mess in the bathroom, trying to help the little one get dressed after going, making sure hands are washed post-successful potty trip, etc.), I could always call out and ask Alexa to set the timer for the next 15 minute interval.Not only did this prove successful during the structured multi-day program, an unintended benefit emerge.  By the end of day 2, when Alexa's timer would go off my little one would look at me and say ""it's potty time?""  Alexa ended up serving as the potty trainer for the little one, not just the timer for the parent.We now have a successfully potty trained little one and have moved on to have Alexa help us with bedtime.  We set the ""10 minute"" timer before bed and once Alexa's alarm goes off we shrug our shoulders and say ""sorry, Alexa says it's night-night time.""  Works like a charm!Hope you enjoy this feedback.  We are HUGE fans in our household!",0.714285714285714,"positive"
5,"Myers","December 19, 2016","I bought 2 for Christmas and have only opened one so far (I will be unwrapping an empty dot box on Christmas).  I know I'm not using her to her full potential but I love it!  Currently I use it to play music, timers, alarms, and shopping list.  I usually hand write lists but some items aren't a ""need now"" thing so those items never get purchased until I'm in desperate need of them and other ""need now"" items are never added because I forget to write them down.  It's pretty awesome being able to tell her to add things to the shopping list and I can check the app and use it for now or later purchases.  I plan to buy one more.  We have a small house and the kitchen is right by the living room, the one in the living room can hear me when I'm in the kitchen.  The only reason I plan to buy another one is because I plan to put the second one in my bathroom and that door has to stay closed always because my dog likes catfood and kitty chocolates.  So the one in there probably won't be able to hear me properly if I'm in my bedroom trying to talk to it.One con is sometimes she hears something on the TV wakes up and tells me she didn't understand or something along those lines.Also don't ask her too many questions close together when she's says she didn't understand the question, It'll make her mad (her light ring will turn red).  If you ask her if she's mad she will respond with ""of course not, we are friends"".  I have 3 boys and a husband, so I don't blame her when her light ring goes red.",0.6,"positive"

Got tired of hearing how Alexa couldn't find the information I asked or how Alex didn't understand what I asked.  Besides turning on some music and dimming lights,  it's really a worthless item.  I truly believe Amazon needs to increase Echo's user friendly interface.  I tried Google at the Verizon store and found that it answered my questions much better and in more detail.Update:After using Alexa for a few more days, I realized the problem must be the Bing search engine.  In my opinion, It is just simply not as good as Google and therefore Echo suffers because of it.  Still disappointed in the product.",0.363636363636364,"negative"

Our only complaint is that she's not that great at ""searching."" So, for example, we say ""Alexa what's a good essential oil for (fill in the blank)"" or ""Alexa how long have DVDs been around?"" & she can't answer the question.  To us, these seem like basic skills she sound be able to perform.However, she can play music, she can set timers & alarms, she plays jeopardy, I'm told she can order pizza & products online though I haven't tried that yet.  I'm sure we will become addicted as time goes on.Overall, well worth the money.",0.7,"positive"

I have to go to it, and lower the volume manually or stop it completely and start over. This is indeed frustrating.

5,"Yau Know Jimmy","October 24, 2016","This little thing is an amazing little gadget! I currently have this on my desk hooked up to my Z623. The echo dot comes in a small little box with a power cable and a manual. The manual has simple direction anyone can follow, simply by connecting it to a power source, connecting it to your speakers (via bluetooth or aux cable), connecting it your wifi, and then simply by downloading the Alexa echo app onto your mobile device. It took me about 5 minutes to set everything up with syncing all my accounts onto the alexa app (such as pandora, iheart radio, phillips hue lightbulb). Every time i enter my office i immediately tell alexa to turn on my lights, play my music, and sometimes ask for the weather and time. The echo dot has 4 buttons on the top volume down, volume up, mute, and the action button. The volume button exactly what you think, if you want your music lower or louder you can simply press any of the volume buttons. But since you have the echo dot, why not just ask alexa to turn the volume up/down.  The mute button is for cases where you do not want Alexa to hear you so you can press the mute button and a red ring will appear to notify you that it is activated. Lastly the 4th button which shows as a dot is the action button. You can use the action button in place of saying ""alexa"" and tell it a command. I personally dont know why you would use this button since you just bought a voice controlled gadget. The Alexa app is also really easy to maneuver around. It keeps a history of everything your echo is doing as well as syncing your devices and accounts to your echo. It has features of telling you the traffic from destination A to destination B once it is set. It has the cabaility of telling you the weather, making you a to do list, shopping list, timer, alarm, order pizza, set up an uber driver to your destination and even reading you a book from audible.com. This small device has a lot of potential and with Amazon's focus on the echo line they will continue to expand this further in the future. This device is definitely worth every penny. I will soon pick up a full Amazon echo to place in my kitchen as I do not want to have a full speaker system laying on my counter, but I still want the full capability that the echo provides throughout my home.",0.75,"positive"
4,"J. Philips","January 21, 2017","I ordered a 6-pack of these items back in September 2016 to be gifts for family and friends at Christmas, and a couple for myself.  Up until January 20, 2017 I had no problem with my devices.  But on that day one went unresponsive and the blue light would spin for a few seconds, then go out, then light up again and start spinning.  It continued this cycle non-stop for hours.  I attempted to reset the device a few times with no success.  Finally I unregistered the device from my Alexa app at which point I could go through setup again on the device.  Got it setup again and was playing music through it again.  I asked Alexa to pause while I went and run some errands.  Upon returning, the device was spinning the blue circle again.  I called Amazon customer help, who then connected me to tech support for the echo.  The tech looked up my account and said I only had 1 day left on my warranty.  For this device they are allowing me to send it back to be checked out and either repaired or replaced.  I asked about the other devices, which a couple are still unopened and not registered, but the tech said that the warranty will expire on them all at the same time.  So, if any of the unregistered, never been used, devices have problems, they are essentially $50 bricks.  Beware that the warranty begins the day that you place the order on these from Amazon.  I like the Echo Dot (actually love it) but the fact that the warranty is ending before a few of the devices have even been registered really irritates me.",0.444444444444444,"negative"

4,"toni","February 4, 2017","Got the Dot 2 and Evo battery, and within 2 weeks I also have an Echo and Tap.  I've been very confused about choosing between these devices just reading.  Impossible.  But I may keep all 3.  They aren't interchangeable for me.  About the Dot 2, I love it but it's not loud enough on its own for me.  Moving it around with the Evo battery was lame.  Why I'm keeping it?  It's the best clock-radio-personal-assistant that money can buy, potential hands free home management - lights, etc.  ""set an alarm for 7am"", ""add to my reminders"", ""weather""... And I can connect it to my stereo system, etc, for big sound hands free - great for entertaining, sitting and working uninterrupted, while house cleaning when my hands are full or wet.  Plus when I travel, it's going with me.  The Evo battery is likely to be returned in favor of the Tap for portable needs.  Only because I got a discount combo deal from Groupon for the Tap at $75.  The $35 Evo battery is fairly useless at about half the price I paid for the Tap and the Dot 2 is too quiet to bother moving around.The Echo I got used and it is in the kitchen - which is big and open with the living room, and patio access.  Fantastic!  It's loud enough to hear over cooking, dishwasher, noise, through an open the door onto the patio.  The sound is big enough for a quality music experience on its own - but can't replace my stereo.  None of the diminutive portable, bookshelf, etc, speakers can do that, even if it says Bose.",0.625,"positive"
4,"Mike","February 13, 2017"," Love Echo Dot!So, full disclosure I'm a 100% Apple guy, but they just don't have the AI options that the Amazon offers with the Echo Dot.  I bought one of the Echo Dots mid-January and then purchased my second a week or two later.  I currently have one on both floors of my house and could not be happier.  Prior to purchasing the Dot I installed about 20 ""Smart Switches (GE/Jasco)"" in my home to automate lighting.  I also have two Nest Thermostats.  With the Echo Dot I'm able to control all of these products through the Wink Hub.I chose the Dot over the full size because I didn't want to be held to their speaker.  I have my downstairs unit connected my Samsung Sound bar and my upstairs unit connected to JBL Bluetooth speaker.  Although, the installed speaker is pretty decent by itself for talk radio or just getting the answer to questions.Setting up the Dot and configuring it with my Wink Hub was seamless and took only seconds.  Really a true plug and play device.My only complaint would be the learning curve when it comes to the talking with Alexa and her sometime inability to understand what I'm saying, but a little over a month in it's getting easier.I also subscribed to ""Unlimited"" music on the Echo and love it.I have attached a video of the lighting automation with just a few of my lights, pretty cool to see in action......

4,"The Divine Ms. K","December 31, 2016","UPDATE FEB 4, 2017:  If you have read my first review you know I had software problems with my Echo Dot. Well I emailed Amazon and a customer service rep called me right back!!!!!!! He was super nice and we went through I-don't-know-many trouble shooting scenarios. Although we couldn't get the issue resolved, he referred me to the next level of customer technical support. While waiting for a contact (I was told to wait several days) the problem resolved itself. When someone from Amazon contacted me with had an additional discussion and we both agreed the problem was related to a skill or skills I had installed the night the problem developed. Since I had already reset the app and I couldn't remember what I had added and in what order, there was nothing further to do. I was given a contact support link to use should the problem return.  You really don't know how good a company is until something goes wrong. Based on this experience with Amazon, I have even more confidence in the company. Thank you Amazon!  PS... my echo teachable moment. Add your skills one at a time and think about staying with apps which at least have several reviews.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I had It is I received this as a Christmas present. Initially I really liked it... it's novel, geeky, and entertaining  (ask Alexa to sing).  I was really hoping for something google like... ""What time does the post office open?""and that kind of thing. Unfortunately, it doesn't really do that well yet. I'm sure that Alexa needs to learn and that will get better over time. Part of the problem is that it uses Bing over Chrome (you can't change the search engine). What it does well is play music from Amazon. Other cons: its ability to have more usefulness relies on ""skills"" which are loosely apps for Echo. The skills allow it to do things it can't do on its own (like tell you what happened on a certain day in history). Skills also allow it to interface with a few existing apps you may have on your phone (e.g. Our Groceries).  A lot of the skills are very limited in their usefulness (e.g. Cat facts). Echo needs verify specific phrasing to give you info or use a skill. In a review I read the reviewer said he felt like he needed flash cards in order to remember how to ask Alexa to do things and I agree/ For setup, and maximum functionality, you need the app on your phone. It turns out that the app doesn't work very well on Samsung Galaxy 6 or 7. In fact, for many (including me) it doesn't work at all. Mine worked long enough to allow me set up the Echo and get a few skills. Now it doesn't work at all. Obviously I haven't been able to connect it to any smart device (like lights). If that is what interests you make sure you do your research.  - requires more than you think and it's not cheap.At the present this is a hockey puck that can tell me the weather. I haven't given up on it though. Some future update will allow the app to work on my phone, Alexa will get better at answering questions, more skills will be available and be less kludgey.",0.727272727272727,"positive"

Diehard / All Things Amazon and Amazon Prime kinda guy!!! It is exclusively for this reason that I have not only once, not just twice, but actually even a third time:-Purchased an Echo ..... (One full size at first, then two of the Dots on the second and third attempts)-Tried it and tried it, over and over again each time, yet with severe failure each time around to ultimately experience any sense of even the most marginal and/or somewhat reasonable degree of correct functionality or purpose or usefulness  *Primarily due to complete lack of voice-recognition and/or functionality*  (---And I am notoriously recognized as a very clearly-enunciated, well-spoken orator)-But each time then being forced to once again return each of them  *At least the first two. The third is currently being boxed-up for shipment to our friends home in another state, whom for whatever reason actually do enjoy theirsThis has, (in my humble opinion), been an extreme showing of devotion to the brand, with a blind hope toward the possibility of any progressively worthwhile increases in functionality along the way with each subsequent purchase.Ultimately, in the end, it must be stated that I ABSOLUTELY WOULD *NOT* RECOMMEND this to even my worst enemy.

When I ask some fairly simple questions (""Alexa, when is the next episode of The Grand Tour?""), Alexa cannot find the answer. If I use the ""OK Google"" feature on my Android phone and ask the same question, I'll almost always get the right answer... the difference between Bing and Google searches, I think.

Dont waste your money getting the full sized version and just get 4-5 of these instead for the same price.  If you want to listen to music then get the full sized verison.  it has incredible sound for what it is.  But this unit has both an output jack for your existing sound system or bluetooth if you have a bluetooth sound system. Personally I would buy this version and spend the money i save on a seperate sound system.  This is so small you can put it any where.  Personally Im thinking about putting one in my car with a MIFI or cellular hotspot.  cant do that with the full sized one.  I got mine when there where on sale so i bought 5 of them and used them as gifts.  People love them.  Lots of apps and of course Amazon tries to ding you on everything with a monthly fee for everything.  They are always trying to upsell you.  And the A.I. is terrible.  If you dont ask something exactly the correct way you get the same stupid response.  Personally I think the Google version is much better and in time the apps available for the Echo will be available for Google.

We would never have thought to purchase this even though we are installing nest, August, etc.  What a great gift!Set up was done in about 2 or 3 minutes.  You need to download the app first.We immediately started playing with the device.  You can play music, get weather and news reports, play games,...a lot of things.I was sure this would be a bust like most voice interactive devices.  The interaction is remarkably smooth.  Even when you mumble it can sort out the info.  My husband was using power tools in another room and even with the racket he was making it picked up every word I said.  We sometimes whisper its name because it has remarkably sensitive hearing.  It hears us from another room.  Don't think you are going to pull one over on it, lol.Tonight I paired it with some Thonet and Vander bt speakers.  It took a couple of tries until I realized I had to do it thru the Alexa app.  By the way, it supposedly will not pair with speakers that use a PIN number.  It works ok.  It took about thirty seconds for the music to stream. It seemed like it was trying to buffer or something.  Once it got going though, it worked well.

I got mine yesterday and at first I was just astonished how easy the set up was.  Literally five minutes up and running and connected to my bluetooth speaker without any problems, just simply download the Alexa app on your cellphone or tablet and it walks you through all steps.  I had read in other reviews pertaining to problems but voice recognition is flawless, i've asked asked questions, set alarms and those too had no problems.  Linked my Pandora and Spotify accounts but with Spotify you must have premium for use with Alexa but even that was no problem for me because between tune in and Pandora I have more than enough content to please my ears.  Speaking of ears, I must have dog hearing because unlike a lot of reviews I actually end up turning the echo dot down in volume since the dot is close to the head of my bed (when it's not connected to my bluetooth speaker) and even can hear it in another room.  I consider myself the ultimate tech head and by far for this device at $39.99 has been one of the best decisions i've made, actually wish I had got one sooner but it made an amazing Christmas gift to myself,  and I haven't utilized all of the features of the product yet but I will definitely be buying another for the front area of my house.

I received my ""Echo Dot"" in the mail about two days ago and I'm already in love with it. I primarily use it to set timers, check weather and the time, wikipedia things as I work, and control the multitude of ""Smart Bulbs"" that I have around the house. I personally use LIFX bulbs in my house but I have also heard good things about the Dot's interactions with Philips Hue bulbs. I live in a one bedroom apartment and even with music playing, dishwasher AND dryer running, I can still call out from the living room to Alexa (which is in the bedroom) and it will STILL HEAR ME.The only real downside that the Dot has in my opinion is the audio quality when it comes to music streaming. I listen to a wide variety of music and the Dot sounds poor with all of them. This downfall is totally fine however because Amazon sells a flippin SPEAKER VERSION OF THE DOT!!! It's name is the ""Amazon Tap"" and I'm looking into buying it as soon as physically possible.In summation: The Echo Dot does exactly what it is marketed to do: provide an affordable version of the Echo which still has all of the utility of Alexa at its disposal.

Well, even if she can't, it is a neat gadget. In my bathroom, those very intelligent home designer, have put the light switch behind the door, meaning, in the dark it is difficult to find it. So, I installed a TP-LINK WiFi switch and viola, now if I have to go, I tell Alexa to switch on the Bathroom Light. By the time I get there, it is lit and I can find the bowl more easily, hi, hi.There are many other things she can do. I am a prime member, therefore I got access to Prime music. With a small speaker attached, or not, she entertains me with the music of my liking. I you are in the mood, she can tell you a joke, no dirty ones of course.The other day I wanted to know how much the distance is between two points and asked her.

5,"Timothy Sobocinski","November 6, 2016","So, we have been wanting Echo for a while.  We have other Amazon products in our house, a Fire TV, two Fire sticks, and a couple Kindles.  Since my old radio alarm clock was dying I decided that I would replace it with a dot, and it is wonderful.  I have it play me classical music to help me get to sleep and Alexa will play it on a sleep timer when asked.  I can set daily alarms, so no longer do I need to set and unset the alarm every morning.  She can run multiple alarms.  Also you can change the sound of the alarm, this is nice because after a while my alarm noise will start being like nails on the chalk board after a while.  Since she is in the bedroom where I get dressed she can give me a briefing of headline news from CNN and weather so I know how to dress for the day.  I do plan on getting Wemo switches for some of the lights in my house that I shut off before going to bed to link up, especially my bed side light, which my wife has forced on me as a job to shut off at night, so now I can give it to Alexa.  Never figured the bedroom would be a good place for Alexa but she works well there.  The little puck fits into the contemporary styling of our room.  One complaint about using Dot as an alarm clock, it has no face so you have to ask the time.  This is bad if you are the first one to wake you might not know the time, so it is hard to tell if you should roll over and go back to sleep, or get up.  Dot is easy to setup at least, and I am planning on more.  So, I would say I am happy with my purchase.",0.444444444444444,"negative"

Bought two Dots for our house and love them.PROS: The mini-jack lets you use your own external speakers, unlike the Echo. It just works! It's a less costly version of the Echo.CONS: There's no ring on the top you can turn to control volume like on the Echo -- I really love that Echo feature. But the buttons you get instead aren't bad.Some find this product confusing. It does exactly what the Echo does for less. It has its own speaker, but not as big or good as the Echo's. But it's still good enough. On the upside, you can attach it to any speakers or amp you want using a mini jack and cable.If you still don't understand what Echo and Dot are all about, JUST BUY ONE! Get the Dot. You'll love it. I have one in the bathroom. I listen to the news while shaving, music while in the shower, check the weather report, and play a round of Jeopardy with Alexa every day. I also make lists of things I need to do while I'm still in the bathroom.We now have one Echo in the kitchen, and a Dot in each of two bathrooms. We love Alexa!

2,"A Reader","January 17, 2017","I bought two dots to serve as devices that could easily play music and news etc. without having to plug my phone into a speaker.  They work OK in this respect; I have them linked up to spotify, and they manage that fine, although I find that 50% of the time I need to go and use the Spotify app, because my voice commands aren't understood right (Alexa is often unwilling to play a Spotify playlist, for example; and she seems unable to understand a request like ""play the new album by ___""  But a couple of serious problems.  First, one major feature I want is the ability to play podcasts.  This seems obvious, right?  In theory, Alexa supports this via TuneIn.  But I've gotten it to work only a handful of times.  You should be able to say ""play the program ___"".  Often Alexa will identify what I want to hear, tell me she is getting the latest episode--and then nothing happens.  Very frustrating.  The other thing I find annoying is the way bluetooth is implemented.  I started connecting my phone via Bluetooth to play podcasts.  But then whenever I entered the room, I got a very annoying and loud message from Alexa about how she was connected to my phone.  Extremely annoying.  These are basic features; I don't want anything fancy.  I just want this device to be able to play podcasts and to be usable as a not-annoying bluetooth device.",0.555555555555556,"positive"

Similar to Siri and Google, but it's much more functional and designed to work with other devices in your home.  Play music, set timers, alarms, control lights & thermostat, ask questions, get information and install specific 'skills' which act like voice activated apps.  For this stage in the game, it's pretty darn clever and it's going to continue to improve.  Amazing work Amazon!Wish list for future updates:- Conversation mode.  When I'm testing the limits of what Alexa can understand, it gets old saying 'Alexa' every time I have a new question to ask.  It would be easier to say 'Alexa, start conversation mode' and then everything I said afterward would be recognized.- Answers to more questions.  I'm already very impressed by how much I can get away with asking, but there's still a lot to be learned.  Amazon isn't a search engine so they are at a disadvantage, but somehow they will have to continue to make strides in this department to stay competitive.- More interactive.

Also, with Amazon Music Unlimited she plays anything I was to hear. When not paired to a speaker, you can hear her just fine, although I mostly have her Bluetooth connected to a portable Bose speaker. I much prefer the Dot over the big Echo as you can pair her with any speaker you want, and she's much easier to move around the house if you want to bring her someplace else. She can hear surprisingly well even from far distances as long as she has a clear-ish line of sight even with a lot of other background noise.My only complaint is I wish she did more. I constantly find myself asking questions that she doesn't know the answer such as, ""What channel is the Wisconsin Badgers playing on tonight?"" Using a Nexus 5x and saying OK Google, usually brings up what I need as the first result, but it doesn't say it back to me. I am a bit curious if Google Home is better at answering quick questions, but I chose the Dot since it was much cheaper and integrates with Amazon Music. Hopefully Echo's get smarter as time goes on.",0.846153846153846,"positive"
5,"Amazon Customer","October 27, 2016","Received my first six pack of Echo dots, one for each of the kids and older grandchildren for Christmas and of course one for me.  Was first introduced to the taller Alexa at my cousins house and was impressed.  But the price was a little out of range and when I saw the Echo dot and read the reviews I couldn't stop myself especially at this price. For the price it is an outstanding value.  Easy to set up and I learn more about it each day.  In fact waiting for another six pack to be delivered because I decided to give two to each household plus one each to the older (10 and above) grandchildren.  Which is perfect becauseChristmas shopping almost done and I think I got the ""hot"" item for the year.  Excited they will continue to add new features to the Echo.  I almost feel like. I need to say ""good morning"" and ""goodnight"" to it each day.  I did have some problems getting my calendar synced with it but had prompt live instant help from representative who gave outstanding service and we finally figured out my email account was different for each item.  I most definitely would recommend buying from Amazon instead of third party just for their outstanding support. For a little chuckle, the other night when I was messing with the Alexa (Echo) app in another room, I was checking out what books it could read to me and didn't realize when I tested one book the Echo had started reading it...when I went into the room where Echo was ... there it was still reading the book...must have been a good book.",0.875,"positive"
3,"mikemac9","November 29, 2016","The big pluses for this compared to devices from other vendors are (1) he wider support for 3rd party apps and devices  (2) more attractive price.  At less than half the price of competing units and only $50 (even less on sale) you're not making a huge purchase here even if you only use it for a year or so.  And if you have a connected home or use some supported apps like OurGroceries you can start using it now.A big minus is that the artificial intelligence from Amazon just isn't where the competition is in terms of quality.  Ask Alexa ""What is the best way to reheat turkey?"" or ""what is the Amazon stock price?"", to give but 2 examples, and Alexa can not answer.  Try this on your smartphone with Siri or Google and you get answers. And that's the rub.  Once you have a device like this you want to just speak and get answers instead of reaching for your phone.You can extend the functionality of the device by enabling ""skills"", pieces of software written for Alexa.  But even this is half-baked.  Keep a list of what you have enabled, because there doesn't seem to be any way on the Amazon website or by asking Alexa to see what you have enabled!This device does a decent amount, but the competition does more in terms of general queries.  Bottom line, this is a nice device and I'm glad I got it.  But I don't know if this is a product line that will have legs.",1,"positive"
5,"Ehh, Well","November 12, 2016","I bought one of these from a 3rd party retail store, and I LOVE it. I can't believe how it digs up music out of thin air, and tunes to radio stations simply by requesting the call letters.But I have a humble request. Fire TV, Apple TV, Blu Ray player, Audio system, TV, Remote extender, Clock, and who knows what else is already on the tables and shelves in our family rooms. The Dot is great, and it's not too large, but it's yet another piece of ""technocrap"" with a wire hanging out of it, in our homes.Y'know what would be cool? An in-wall hard-wired version of the Dot. Given the size of the Dot, I can easily see that this technology can be packed into the form of a light switch. It would be AWESOME to be able to install this in an electrical box. Of course that would mean millions of people talking to a wall, but us married folks do that already quite often. So it would be a nice change for the wall to actually listen and do what we ask it to do. If someone knows how I can float this idea to Amazon, it would be great.It wouldn't even have to be a big design change. All they need to do is build the Dot into a square or rectangle, and then make a light switched sized carrier for it so you can just drop it in. You could call the new product ""Dot2"", with the 2 being small and up to the right to mean ""Dot Squared"". Because I'd love to install this thing in the wall and have it out of sight.",1,"positive"
5,"Lindsey","January 16, 2017","We have all three of the Echo products: The Dot, The Tap, and the original Echo. The Dot works very similarly to the original Echo. You say the wake word, you give a command or question, it responds. It does have a speaker itself, but it doesn't get as loud as the original Echo or the Tap. All of the devices will sync together in one Amazon app, but they all still work independently. Meaning, if I set an alarm on the Dot, only the alarm on the Dot goes off. But with the app on my phone, I can access all the devices in the one place. The Original Echo is better for larger areas. the Dot is ideal if you already have a sound system you would like to connect the Dot to, or small spaces like bathrooms or bedrooms. The Dot is great for kids. My daughter has it in her room so she can ask it how to spell words and such. The Tap is an entirely different beast, in my opinion. No wake word. Touch and talk. But it works via Bluetooth and wifi for on the go use using your cellular device. The Echo Dot does not come with a remote. Like the Original Echo, it needs to be plugged into the wall and needs wifi. (The Tap has a chargeable battery.) They are all great devices, though Amazon still has some work to be done on them. Each has a different place where it is the ideal choice, so which you should choose really depends on your needs.",0.8,"positive"

One thing I have learned about it is that it does not know all the answers. I was under the impression that when you asked this thing questions it will scan the Internet and find answers very quickly but it seems that you have to be  more specific with your questions. That I find to be a pain in the you know what. What I do Like about it is it's integration with Spotify. I can call up any one of my Spotify playlist and the echo dot will play it.  The unit is very helpful in the kitchen as far as asking for measurements in cooking .  It can be used as a standalone alarm clock for it has a built in speaker, not the best but loud enough to wake you up if it's on your nightstand. I have also found  The echo DOT connect with Bluetooth speakers without any glitches but you will not want to use them as a part of your alarm clock due to the Bluetooth speakers usually time out or shut down in order to save battery life it's just a built-in function on most of your Bluetooth speakers. I thought I would let you know. if you do want a loud alarm you may want to consider hooking it up to a bookshelf stereo system from the 3.7 mm connection port on the echo dot. Don't give me wrong I do like the dot and I recommend it highly. My next step is to automate my lights and receptacles",0.428571428571429,"negative"
5,"Kimtexas","January 8, 2017","Absolutely a great addition to my original Amazon Echo.  I heard that the ""first generation"" of the Echo Dot didn't pick up your voice that well, but I think they must've corrected the issue with this 2nd generation b/c I can almost whisper & it picks up my voice.  Granted, when I whisper, I'm not far from it, but even across the room, I don't have to yell or anything.  I love that it's small enough that doesn't take up a lot of space on my nightstand (I'd knock over the full-size Echo on my nightstand).  I'm definitely getting another Echo Dot for another room.Pros:- Small & compact enough to put in smaller spaces (like a nightstand, or kitchen counter)- Ability to plug in, or connect, to a larger speaker- Even without a plugged-in speaker, the sound is pretty goodCons:- Not quite as good a sound as the full-size Echo, but it makes up for it for the fact that you can plug in any speaker you want (haven't figured out yet whether you can do that with a bluetooth speaker, or if it has to be directly plugged in, but I wouldn't care either way)- It's great as an alarm clock, although I wish there were more choices for the alarm ""ringtone"" (I'd love for it to have the options that my cell phone does b/c I can put a blaring sound on my cell phone)",0.733333333333333,"positive"

I can tell the Dot to open Rain Sounds, or play soft music or nature sounds from my Amazon playlists. I can also tell the Dot to set a sleep timer and it stops playing after that amount of time. I get up extremely early for work, and I'm looking forward to having white noise this summer when I'm trying to sleep early while the neighbors are still out mowing, etc. The Alexa skills are useful to hear the weather and news without putting on my glasses and checking my phone.",0.714285714285714,"positive"
5,"Steve","February 20, 2017","I was incredibly skeptical when Amazon launched the Echo. It seemed really really un-necessairy to me. Little did I know that about two years later the Echo would be the thing to launch me in to home automaton, a hobby which I enjoy greatly. I initially was given an Echo Dot by a friend who was moving out of the country to a place where amazon does not support the echo, and one night while slightly intoxicated and bored at home, I decided to set it up. Initially I was less than impressed, but then discovered that the Echo was great for smart device control, and added it to my existing four HUE Lights. Now I was hooked. Now I have a second Dot for my upstairs floor.I like the dot much more than I think I would like the large, tower sized standard echo. on both of the floors on my house, I have a nice set of speakers that I already use to listen to my stuff, having a second speaker would seem like a waste to me.I also really like these for their bluetooth audio streaming that allows me to send audio from my phone to those speakers. I used to do this with Air Play over the Apple TV. While Air Play is over the network which mans that the phone does not have to be in bluetooth range, I find that connecting my phone to the echoes is easier and that is what I tend to do more frequently now.",0.8,"positive"

In conjunction with my Harmony hub, I can now control my HDTV, Apple TV, and Blu-Ray player via voice command. Also in conjunction with my Philips Hue hub, I control 7 lights around the house via voice command.  In addition, it is nice to be able to ask ""Alexa"" to play music from whichever group or genre that I wish to listen to while doing chores around the house.  I use Bluetooth to connect the Dot to my stereo receiver so that I can listen to the music via my 5.1 speakers rather than from the small speaker in the Dot.The weather report is not as detailed as I would get on my iPhone but it does provide the basic info that I need.  Ditto for the news summaries.  I am adding more skills as I learn the nuances of the Dot.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and have purchased another one for the master bedroom.  The Dot is an easy way and reasonably priced way of home automation.Although it was noted that I can change the ""wake"" name from Alexa, the only other choices are ""Amazon"" or ""Echo"".

The android app would not install on a smartphone, another issue with an older OS, but I was able to get the app on a Kindle Fire and complete the initial set-up. All told, close to one-and-a-half hours of aggravation.I use the Dot for listening to music and setting alarms. I have not used the Dot to shop Amazon or to remotely control devices.Alexa worked fine for a couple days, but has aged quickly as her ability to hear commands has decreased significantly. I sometimes have to repeat ""Alexa"" four or five times to get the device to respond. Relocating the Dot has made no change in the device's ability to hear better. ""Training"" Alexa to understand and recognize voices has not made any improvement.The ""Skills"" on the app store are very redundant or have limited audience appeal. Alexa cannot understand two commands at one time.

The original echo has an amazing sound quality whereas the dot does not. The sound is very mono, it actually sounds like a cheap speaker from the flea market, and the speaker does not get very loud, despite the volume being at full blast and my phone being at full blast.  Mind you, I don't like my music loud enough so my neighbors can hear it, but I'd like to hear it over my shower head and I can't. Installation was easy, connecting it to the Wi-Fi was easy, overall the app configuration was easy to learn. Despite this being a convenient hands free system, it lacks a lot of the essential qualities of a well-sounding mobile speaker I could have gotten for $20, maybe $30. I also don't like that the unit (like the first generation) is entirely dependent on being plugged in. There's no battery for these units and it shuts off and restarts every time I move it around my apartment from the bathroom/bedroom to the kitchen so I can have music while I cook. I'd keep it in the bedroom and let the music play except I can't hear it from the kitchen. I don't think i would make this purchase again but I'm stuck with it until the next generation comes out with a better sound quality. I wish Amazon had a way to test out these speakers before buying.

It answers all kinds of crazy questions and the voice is very lifelike, not like those early text-to-speech programs that you're used to hearing.  We're using the echo dot as a stand alone device with no external speaker attached.  The little speaker in it actually sounds ok--its gets pretty loud and music sounds ok on it.  Of course, sometimes we hook up an external speaker if we're going to listen to music for a while.  I really like saying good morning to Alexa in the morning.  She always comes up with some crazy fact of the day or a joke.  Its very cool.  It takes the place of a calculator for doing simple math--you can ask it what is 522x650 and it will give you the answer.  Sometimes you want to calculate tax on something, so you just ask Alexa and she does it.  We don't have any connected devices yet, but it will be cool someday when we can walk into a dark room and have Alexa turn on the lights.  I think that's something I will discover next.

I have enjoyed listening to some Podcasts and playing around with the ""Skill"" apps.....The To Do List and Shopping List is a wonderful feature of Alexa...no looking for paper and pen when using the last of something...immediately tell Alexa to add to your shopping list and then it goes to your phone App...ready when you are out and what to pick up those things...I use it to play music almost everyday. Prime Amazon has unlimited amount of choices or you can tell Alexa to play a certain category like Jazz, Christian, Children, Quiet Restful Music, etc, etc,... I decided to purchase a portable Bluetooth Speaker that would pair with the Echo Dot and the one I chose was Foogo and it paired easily and has good sound and great volume.

The speaker is a ""EasyAcc Mini Portable Bluetooth 4.0 Speaker with Mic"" (3W 500 mAh)  I connect this to the speaker (has a microphone) and works great together.I was surprised by the sound from the internal speaker and how well it picked up my voice when using it.  However, using the external speaker for music was far superior.This product continues to grow in capability and look forward to new features being added.  Would be nice to be integrate with some search engine to answer questions like ""When was General Electric founded"".  The first time I said it, Alexa interpreted my comment as ""when was john lectric founded"" .  I didn't know until I ran the Amazon Alexa web page and examined it.  The second time, it understood.The second example I tried was ""When did Charles Lindbergh fly across the Atlantic?""

(My favorite so far is freaking out the cat by telling Alexa to ""open the box of cats and tell it to talk to my cat."") We use it mostly control our TP-Link smarthome devices, and it's worked flawlessly to do that. We also ask it to play music for ambient noise sometimes. I'm sure it doesn't have the best sound quality considering its size and price, but for low-volume music just so the house isn't quiet, it's perfect. I love that I can just tell it to ""play my Awesomesauce playlist from spotify"" and it just does it. The Uber functionality is pretty sketchy so far, hopefully it gets improved. And I can tell you that it was NOT fun to watch election coverage on November 8th, because every time someone on TV said ""election"", she thought they were saying ""Alexa"". That was kind of a pain in the butt. Also, sometimes she thinks she's been asked something and will just randomly add 2 and 1/2 and give you the super helpful response when you didn't ask for it. The voice detection between units could use a bit of work, since sometimes the unit in the den (20 feet away) will pick up my question instead of the unit in the living room (1 foot away). Other than those minor things, though, I LOVE THESE!!! I definitely recommend them for anyone wanting smarthome functionality.",0.761904761904762,"positive"
4,"John Q Public","January 28, 2017","Alexa/Echo Dot is a fun toy.  I use it daily, primarily for controlling smart-home features such as lights and playing music/podcasts.  I've been a bit disappointed in the fact that it's needed to be reset about 1-2x per week because it freezes or loses WIFI connection and cannot recover.  I have 2 Dots, and they both show the same issues.  Also, for about a week, it was picking up on anything said nearby, thinking we were trying to give it a command.  That issue has seemingly resolved itself, so I'm not sure if there was a software update issue or ??  Other than that, it's been good, and though it has a few wrinkles which I'd expect, it has been useful.  I'd recommend it.",0.416666666666667,"negative"

When I first read about the Echo Dot, I kept seeing comments that the speaker was weak and low-fidelity. It was therefore a pleasant surprise to find that the Dot's speaker is actually quite good for a device of its size. No, it's not up to that of the full-size Echo but it is compact and can be connected to an external wired speaker which the Dot's big sister cannot. It's fine for casual listening to music or for use as an alarm clock.Functionally, the Dot does everything the bigger Echo can do and the voice recognition is just as good. I love that it is so small and easy to place around the house.",0.818181818181818,"positive"
5,"Susan B. from Houston","January 2, 2017","For those of you gadget people out there, you will love this. I bought this so I can have my Pandora playlists play and so it will read my Kindle books to me. If someone is getting it as kind of like a novelty item, it might get old fast but I had a purpose. I also shared my calendar with it and setup a few little things it can answer for me each day for fun. Anyway, I have had it set up for 24 hours and I'm not disappointed one iota. I love having music on and at night I listen to books read to me on my OLD Kindle 'cause the newer ones don't read aloud. Now I can buy the Paperwhite I want because I have a way to have my books read to me through the Echo Dot. This will pair with Bluetooth so I can setup my headphones to it too. It's such a great little gadget!!!! Amazon has done a good job on trying to improve with using the app to give feedback too. It's just a cool thing that I didn't need but I felt I had to have and I'm so glad I got it. BTW, my music can just come out of the Echo Dot or you can pair it to a speaker. In addition, you don't have to say ""Alexa"" if you change it to another name on the app. I haven't changed it to anything else because I like saying Alexa since I don't know anyone with that name and it's just easy to keep it the same.",0.928571428571429,"positive"

There are bus / train routes apps for both coasts, but in Denver CO there isn't anything relevant. the listings for restaraunts is lacking as well. we have literally hundreds of mexican restaraunts in my area, but Alexa can only find a couple (it misses one of my favorites right down the street with multiple locations around town.) it so far can't keep up with either siri or google for asking it questions about general knowledge much less the obscure things you may want to ask for help with. everything is a multi step request alexa ask <insert app name here> to do something for anything to happen, and you have to continually check the app on your phone to add new functions it should add functionality as it becomes available instead of a manual process.",0.666666666666667,"positive"

Many great artists and songs have names in foreign languages.What I had to do to set up stations Pandora doesn't understand was set up the station that I want through my phone, make up a generic playlist name such as ""banana"", and ask Alex, ""Alexa, play my Pandora station banana.""Takes some playing around, but I'm definitely enjoying this product.",0.857142857142857,"positive"

I don't have any interest in ordering things verbally or controlling appliances verbally.  Recently I have been seeing adds on tv for the Google Home.  I looked it up and the reviews state it is much better as a verbal search engine than Echo Dot.  I will purchase one of those.

3,"Amazon Customer","February 5, 2017","Works well with harmony to control your home entertainment center and plays music well.  However, the naturalness of commands needs work as well as alexa understanding what you say needs work.  For example, try asking alexa to play rihanna and youll soon find you cant b/c alexa wont understand her name and she is not a minor star.  The other annoying thing is when you ask for a song that either you don't have in your library or more commonly alexa misunderstands the song name and therefore isn't in your library, she will start pushing amazon unlimited constantly by playing a sample of the song she misunderstood and you didn't want in the first place to push amazon music unlimited.  This happens every single time and gets very annoying.  I could understand once or twice but not constantly.  It detracts from the experience.  Alexa is getting better all the time but is not fully there yet.  Alexa could also use some more useful skills rather than most of them which are somewhat pointless and you use once before never using again.  Home automation is the strong point, light control, home entertainment center control (with harmony) and playing music (with some annoyances).  The skills still need some work to become more useful.

Days after giving it to the recipient (already late), I noticed in my Alexa app that the new Echo Dot had automaticallt been registered to my account, but it wasn't intended to be mine!. After all, it's a voice controlled device so the app isn't needed unless you're making changes like adding a Wemo.  I might not have noticed this for months!

5,"Olof Scholten","December 27, 2016","I love my Echo Dot. 'Alexa' is now, may be not the same as the big one (I am speaking about the sound) but therefore she is the same, when you give her any question or command. When you connect the BT-Speaker you have a Full and (depending on the speaker) even better 'Alexa' as the original. The speaking is not always as you would speak normally, but after a short time you now how to speak to her to get the right answer. There is a lot of knowledge behind her and this can all been used by you. The wake up call and the kitchen recipes and the shopping list..... There are so many things that are useful, I love her in my house. I hope that not everything is stored on the Amazon (or NSA) Servers, to make a profile from me, but even in that case, Google knows more about me as Alexa, so I have to live with that.When you buy more than one, you have her in any room and that makes it even better. I use Alexa also for the Automation. This is at the moment a little difficult, because I live in Germany and I use Alexa in English. This gives a lot of trouble for the skills.

5,"Tony","October 26, 2016","Update:March 4, 2017🅿🆁🅾🆂🔶Good value for the price🔶Has an audio output port so you can hook it up to your own set of speakers, so this would be advantageous over the original if you have a good set of speakers (Echo version does not have the audio out port, however the unit's speakers are better)🔶Good value for the price🔶Thousands of skills and new ones are added daily🔶Small and compact, well constructed🔶Durable, I have had it for over 6 months now and it is in still in excellent condition🔶Offers tons of convenience: I can turn on the lights without getting out of the bed, ask for the weather, time, news, alarm etc🔶I can listen to prime music, popular stations, create my own playlist as well upload own collection of songs and listen to those🔶Setup was very straight forward and only took me a few minutes🅲🅾🅽🆂🔶Speakers are adequate for listening to songs, but could definitely be better (I have a set of bose speakers so I hook Alexa up to those and it sounds fantastic)🔶Voice recognition is good if there is no other noise in the background, however if I am playing music sometimes I have to shout in order for Alexa to hear me. On occasion however, Alexa does have trouble understanding certain words that I say to her if she has never heard it before and certain words even if she has heard them before, sometimes she misinterprets them for something else. However, it seems she is getting better at understanding what I tell her once I use that command more often.Overall, I am still very happy with the purchase of the echo dot and would definitely recommend it for the value that it brings to my daily life.Oct 2016: This is my first Echo and I have to say it is one o the best valued purchased that I have made in my entire life.  I have been wanting to get an Echo for sometime now, but have been put off by the price of the original Amazon Echo. As soon as this affordable model came out I knew I had to get it and I had one unit on preorder. When I finally received this unit last Thursday, I was suprised at how compact in size it is. After plugging it in and setting it up, which took about 1-2 minutes I immediately fell in love with it.  The setup process was extremely straight forward and quick. I already had a bose campanion sets of speaks so I just used the AUX out cable to plug the echo into my speakers. However even without the use of an outside set of speakers, I thought the echo dot still sounded relatively decent even for playing music. Alexa was able to recognize pretty much everything that I asked her to do such as turning on the light, playing music, asking about the weather, the news etc. Even when I am outside the room, about 10 feet away from her she can easily hear my normal speaking voice. The only time that she has trouble hearing me is when I have her playing really loud music, which is to expected considering I would not be able to hear someone talking in a loud room. She also has the ability to learn your speech pattern and voice the more often you use her, so she can better recognize and understand what it is that you want her to do. I also love the set alarm feature on her, I can simply tell her to set an alarm for 10 minutes or set an alarm for 8 am the next day without having to go onto my phone in the middle of the night. Another awesome feature about her is definitely how she can control smart light bulbs. For someone that is lazy as I am when getting out of bed at night to turn off the light, it is such a blessing to be able to simply say ""Alexa turn off the light."" Another neat feature about her is that lately I have been having insomnia due to a big state board examination coming up, so I have been using her to help me sleep by playing relaxing ambiance. At the moment, you also change her name from Alexa to either Echo or Amazon. I currently have her under Echo in my room and Alexa in the living room since sometimes when I am calling to Alexa, the echo in the living room would pick it up as well. After getting my 1st unit, I ended up getting the 5 for 6 echo deal as I wanted another one in my living room as well and I also wanted to give some away as gifts to my family and friends. For $250 for 6 units, plus 5% cash back from discover credit card and the $5 gift card balance after reloading $100, each unit ended up costing me $38.75 which is just awesome value for all of the features that she can provide.",0.725,"positive"

It's like your Tony Stark (aka Iron Man) and you have your own personal assistant (Jarvis) who is able to control or answer whatever you want with your voice! I only have some minor disappointments with the device. The biggest one of all is the fact that you're going to need to shell out some extra cash if you really want it to do everything it claims it can do. You're going to need a Spotify Premium account (not the basic free) in order to use Spotify or pay for Amazon's Prime Music. They do let you access internet radios like Pandora, iHeartRadio, and SoundCloud for free (by downloading a Skill aka App in the Alex Mobile Companion App) but it's just not the same as an internet music streaming service like Spotify. And if you want it to control the lights and temperature in your home, you're going to need to buy all these special wifi house plugs, thermostats, and even wifi bulbs! Other than that, this is still an incredible device and can provide hours of entertainment and information for you, family, and friends.

I've since purchased 3 more and absolutely love it. It's the closest thing we have to ubiquitous computing today. In the kitchen I can ask her how many cups in a gallon or for a recipe. At my desk I can ask what's on my calendar for the day, have her set a timer for a particular task, play music I love or read me one of my kindle books. Before I head upstairs, I can ask her to turn on the lights so I don't have to stumble into a dark room. I love the built in humor. I can ask her for a joke or to beam me up. The kids like learning facts from her (from skills) and the games. My father in law loved the music as he rattled off loads of 70's song titles and she complied without complaints. It's a seamless experience between services and devices. We now have one downstairs, and two upstairs in bedrooms. They don't interfere with each other so if my son sets an alarm it won't go off in every room, which I appreciate. But they all have access to whatever skills are enabled on any of them.

Why would I need to use it to get the link, while I can search from mobile in a seconds.Since I don't use Spotify and other US services, the only useful thing for me is a limited Harmony support.

I can find anything I want to here that Spotify or Amazon does not have. The echo works but it reminds me of Xbox vs PlayStation the xbox you have to pay more for what already come with the PlayStation. The home gives you 6 month free of service also.

The google home works better with Android phones also. the home is still growing because it just came out but I think it will surpass the echo in a year.

I got in touch with support and it's pretty much, did you reboot everything? did you reset the Dot? still not working? We will exchange it for you. The problem here is that the Dot has NO diagnostic functions at all. Either end-user facing or that support can access. Had there been some, I'm sure we would have figured out that it was a compatibility issue with my wireless access point long before I figure it out on my own. In the end I reconfigured the access point to work only on the 2.4GHz range and it worked a whole lot better.Besides the VERY limited support (It's not the reps fault, the device needs built in diagnostics) the device is great. Integration with other services works well and is easy to implement. The sound is good enough for us, though we are no audiophiles.

I got an iPhone and iPad and Siri is just about as useful as Alexa.

It doesn't sound like much work to press the button to turn on the mic but I find I never have the tap in arms reach and walking over to touch the button is more work than walking over to look at a clock or my thermostat or turn on the light switch or whatnot.

The low price on the dot enticed us to give it a try, and I am glad we did. There is a fairly wide variety of music and information that is accessible with just a prime account. It is quite handy to have Alexa play specific music, set an alarm, or check weather or news. We have not had luck with general knowledge questions, such as ""what is the current price of silver"" or ""who was Mussorgsky"". She simply replies, ""I could not find the answer to your question"". All in all I am glad we purchased it, we didn't realize that it had to be plugged in at all times, I somehow overlooked the fact that it doesn't have a battery, I assume the larger Echo does, but the Dot does not. Have been quite pleased with how responsive it is, almost always responds instantly whenever someone says ""Alexa"" anywhere in the room.

5,"Michael J Cakora","January 3, 2017","Fantastic device, purchased for wife who's technologically impaired. SHE LOVES IT. I set up a Pandora account for her on her laptop and phone, and then linked it via Bluetooth to our Vizio S2121 speaker bar. She gets the weather, switches from classical music to Carolina Beach music to a radio station to whatever in a snap. Very user friendly. While the music is playing she’ll ask who the composer or artist performing is and the answer comes instantly.To play the music through the Vizio bar, all she has to do is start the music via Alexa (“Alexa, play classical), then power on the bar and hit the bar’s Bluetooth button, then tell Alexa to use the speaker. Simple, just great for someone transitioning from the 20th to the 21st century. When she stops the music, the sound bar reverts to the TV from Bluetooth, so it’s painless for her.The only disappointment is that the Echo Dot does not support the Sirius XM channels. My wife has the online subscription and can play it on her phone or laptop, but can’t yet access the programs via Echo Dot.I recommend this over the Echo because of the 3.5 mm plug and Bluetooth if you have a sound bar, headset, or equivalent to use within typical Bluetooth ranges.",0.777777777777778,"positive"

Distance- it picks up my voice from 2 rooms away without really yelling.cons/wishes- i wish you could choose your own name for it, that is a security issue as recently happened here, when tv reporters said Alexa ordered a doll house, and everyone with a dot within range of the tv had doll houses ordered.

4,"Subash","December 7, 2016","I was very skpetical to try Echo for a while. Made up my mind this thanks giving and bought it along with Belkin switches to get started with the smart home.Alexa is definitely not a matured voice recognition technology. However it impressed me by being better than I had expected it to be (After my failed attemps with both Google and Cortana) I love the fact that I can do some tiny tasks now sitting on my couch :) I also like the fact that I dont have to take out my phone to play the tracks/albums from Spotify/Pandora and cast it to chromecast devices. The speaker on Alexa is loud enough for me to play music in the background. Bluetooth connection to my home theater is very stable(repeated connect/disconnects) I get snippets of tech happenings and my calender everyday morning. Saves my eyes and finger from interacting with mobile. Also its natures gift that hearing is so much less energy intensive compared to reading (makes sense why schools are still needed to learn)I hope Amazon is seriously pushing this technology for betterment. I see huge potential. It is not smart today, but can become and converse naturally with the users.

5,"Jeff Kimes","January 7, 2017","Alright folks. Here is what I wanted to know before I made the mistake of buying the Google Home. First off,  I tried that...  Needless to say it had terrible microphone pickup and was a bear to configure using IFTT. Consistency was an issue with all commands.On to the Echo Dot. This device absolutely does everything that the Alexa would do. All you are missing is the big speaker. You can connect this to a Bluetooth speaker and get the great sound that you're looking for. However it also has a good speaker that is decent as well. Its function is wonderful! It has not missed a single command in the past week, and assigning skills is a breeze! It recognizes Who You Are and allows you to order from Amazon as well! I've actually bought three of these now for multiple locations in the house. The interface through the app is very easy to use and it helps you remember what you've asked it before in the past. Set up was also very quick and easy, there were simple instructions and Alexa was quick to recognize both my network and also my smart devices in the house. You should not hesitate a second in investing in this device. The Price is Right, and it is only going to get better as more skills and product integration are created.",0.705882352941177,"positive"
5,"Ron","November 15, 2016","So, I'm a sceptic when it comes to items that claim they do great things with very little money.  This $49 Dot is AMAZING!  How? What? Is this magic?  I've had it 2 weeks now and it keeps getting better!  I grew up on Apple product using them since the 1980's.  I must say, Apple claims to the the leader with Siri, but Siri has NOTHING on Alexa! This Dot just works that well!I have it hooked up to my hi-fi stereo system that I leave on all the time. I walk into my house, and it hears me from different rooms!  I just say ""Echo, play music""..and music starts to play! (Note: you can name it Alexa, Echo or Amazon, I have mine named Echo). Then if you buy the $3.99/month music service it will play virtually any album know to man. Example... ""Echo play Pink Floyd's The Final Cut""...  The album starts playing.  ""Echo, next track"" and it goes to the next track on the album. ""Echo, volume to 10"" and it turns the volume up.Then, I bought optional wifi outlets. A 2-pack for $50. They work insanely well with the Dot.  ""Echo, turn on lights""... All lights turn on.  ""Echo, turn off bedroom light""... and just the bedroom turns off.You just have to get one. At $49, just think of it as taking a class on knowledge of living in the future!",0.875,"positive"
2,"BrainSlayer","December 30, 2016","Decided to try two Dots instead of getting two more Echoes since I had some good quality speakers just sitting in a box. So far, I don't love them. I don't understand why a white unit comes with a black cable. That's just plain stupid, as many similar reviewers agree. But there are more serious problems. (1) There is often a small delay before Alexa's voice comes out of the speaker -- so much so that the ""oh"" in Alexa's ""okay"" command confirmation is missed. (2) I have to repeat my commands to the Dots pretty frequently -- something I never have to do with my Echo. Both units are being replaced; I'll update this review accordingly if things change.",0.428571428571429,"negative"
5,"Unbiased Reviewer","January 30, 2017","Picked up one when it was on sale.  I wasn't really sure what the DOT was about.  It was cheaper than the Echo.I hooked this unit up to my SONOS Play 5 for huge immense music sound through the LINE IN/AUX jack port.  (You could also connect it to an external Bluetooth speaker)It was a new fun thing to fight over trying to control Alexa.  Everyone wanted to play their own song since we have Amazon Prime.  Amazon Prime has a very large collection of free music, but only plays samples if its not available.  You need to pay for Prime Music in order to have the entire collection.After the novelty wore off, I moved it to my daughters room so she could listen to her Pandora stations.  The small built-in speaker is good enough for a small quiet room.I'm assuming Amazon Echo is exactly like a the DOT except it comes with a powerful speaker.  Functionally should be the same since it's the same Alexa voice controls.Cons:  It can not play music off my Network Storage device, so I still use SONOS for those music files.  Yes, there is a way around it but why go through the hassle.  Amazon music does not have any of the K drama songs available, which is mostly what she listens too.",0.923076923076923,"positive"
5,"Di","January 5, 2017","I purchased this for my mother.  I'll admit it: I did it because I got tired of her asking me to add things to the shopping list instead of using the smartphone app that's on her phone.  Or asking me what the weather is going to be instead of using her phone.  I can understand her reasoning.  She needs reading glasses to see the screen and it's a pain to hunt for your glasses then when you found them, forget what you were going to do.  The Echo Dot is making my life easier, and entertaining her as well.Alexa and mom are still learning about each other, so there have been times where mom has called Alexa stupid.  I swear that Alexa sounds dejected when she responds.  But she has been a big help.  Asking her to add something to the list from the kitchen is wonderful.  Using one of her skills to tease the cats is hilarious (the skill is called ""Meow!"").  And we are still learning how to use her more and more.Our only issues involve the lack of certain skills, such as sending quick emails or setting reminders.  I am sure that the functionality is there somewhere, or if not, that it would be in the near future.  But right now, we are enjoying our time learning and growing together with Alexa.",0.5,"netural"

3,"Diana Prince","January 18, 2017","Its OK if you have never had smart devices for your home; but it does not do web searches for information well and it can not compete with Apple products skills such as Siri. One has to enable multiple skills and are required to say certain words/phases to make each skill work. too many to remember and the Echo Dot sometimes can not return and answer; ok most of the time cant unless a skill was enabled and you say the right words.  The Echo Dot is great for verbally turning on music, asking for daily news , getting the local weather, get daily horoscopes and making to do/shopping lists. You can verbally setting alarms, turning on smart devices (from one smart device; the echo dot). Keep in mind it costs more money to get a bridge/hub to use these smart devices; about $60-$70 on top of buying the Echo Dot. I had to get a Gmail account IOT use the email and calendar skills.  I have an apple account with my books, music, movies, calendars, and email and I cannot sync these with the echo dot.  I would have to change my entertainment to all things Amazon with a monthly fee to use these skills with the echo dot.  Also, would have to start using GMail account skills and Amazon for music,books , and movies/TV shows.",1,"positive"

I have connected a blue tooth speaker and listened to hours of music upon my personal voice request. I have also played with many voice features such as news and weather reports but realize that I have not even scratched the surface of the echo dot's capabilities.  I would imagine if your serious tech person this product would not meet your expectations. So why look at it and review it? This tech challened guy gives it five stars.",0,"negative"
3,"Meron","February 6, 2017","I really enjoy my Echo Dot, but at this point it is more a novelty than an assistant, as it is inconsistent and some of the interfacing is clunky.For example, I have it connected to a single smartbulb with a specific name.  Sometimes I will give a command to dim or brighten it, and have Alexa respond that there are ""several devices with that name, which one do I want?""  There is ONE device with that name.  At least Siri never gaslighted me.  Other times the same exact command will work.The Flash Briefing and timer functions are very good, though some content providers are far better than others, and a handful appeared to disappear since I first started using them less than a month ago.  The alarm works as it should, and some of the other Skills/Apps are fine so long as you remember the exact keyword.One other peeve is that if you ask for certain things by the wrong name, Alexa will try to prompt you to sign up for a paid subscription and can't be halted until the pitch is done.  This is obnoxious.For the price, it's nice to have, but the assistant is really not quite there yet and being pitched for subscription services made me consider returning it.",0.642857142857143,"positive"
5,"Bryan Hammel","December 31, 2016","There are many reviews for these and without being too repetitive I wanted to note a few things I have noticed so far.First off I was really impressed with the packaging. I bought 3 of these for 2 bedrooms and my mancave. Small but quality packaging is not typically something I notice but was a great first impression upon opening the Dot's box.These do just as much as the full size Echo just without the sound quality. I hooked up a set of speaker to them in my office via the 3.5mm headphone jack next to the power input which made up for the difference. Using the Dot is surprisingly easy. While in the room, it will activate with even a whisper often times. Trying to activate while it is playing music or talking required a normal talking volume. I did notice that if you have anything blocking your line of sight to the Dot it becomes less sensitive. Use from another room will require an elevated tone. Trying to get its attention from another room while it is playing music will require near yelling. I don't think any of this is unusual but I want to give those reading an idea of  the sensitivity of the unit.Overall having a Home Assistant is pretty nice and Amazon has done well with the Dot.",0.777777777777778,"positive"
4,"Kindle Customer","March 4, 2017","I bought the original Alexa a year ago and then I bought 3 of the dots so I don't have to scream from one room to the other. I think my belkin router is too weak and too old to reach the dot that I put in a far room. Obviously the speaker is not as high quality as the larger Alexa unit, and I don't know if you can sync all of them to play a song at the same time to provide me with music as I work around the house. that would be nice.",0.5,"netural"

Works decent, but she doesn't seem to know a lot of the answers to questions I try asking.. thanks a lot Bing... maybe if it used Google it would work better haha. Supposed to work well over music and TV, but it still can't hear me when the TV is on. Also, it doesn't understand the groups that are linked to my Phillips Hue light, only the individual light names which is weird, I'm pretty sure I have it set up right too. So that's kinda annoying that I have to say each individual light on in a room to turn them on, a bit disappointing there too.

5,"J. D. Rotz","January 24, 2017","For $50, this is a good deal - I saw it before for $35, which would have been a steal.  If you've read about how much fun and useful the Dot (or any Alexa-based product) can be, you won't be disappointed.Be aware that the speaker on the Dot isn't very powerful, and if you use it to stream to a remote stereo system like I am, it will take some balancing to get the volumes right - when you disconnect bluetooth from the stereo, the Dot volume can be very low, and if you turn up the Dot volume and then reconnect, you'll get blown out of the room.I've set it up in the garage to stream music via bluetooth to an old stereo system.  It's great to be able to control things with voice commands, instead of doing it manually with dirty, greasy hands.  Also, the different things Alexa can do make it so much better than just hooking up a radio, or tape player, or some other peripheral device - adding things to your To-Do or Shopping lists is pretty cool when you're working on a project and don't have  a pencil and paper handy.  For $70 (Dot + Bluetooth receiver) and an old stereo that was sitting in the storeroom doing nothing, this setup is cheap and works much better than I thought it would.",0.764705882352941,"positive"

The only time it has trouble is when multiple people are speaking.  It was a breeze to connect up and start using.  At this rate, once Amazon figures out the delivery to packages via drones, I may never have to get up off the sofa again.The only thing that irked me was it went on sale for $10 off the regular price the week after I bought it.",0.428571428571429,"negative"
3,"Andrew Hollingsworth","January 10, 2017","Great concept, poorly executed. It's better as a novelty item than something that makes home life easier.Design wise it's the best looking device of this type on the market, compact which makes it great for small spaces and appealing color pallets. Unfortunately looks aren't all that matters.I have experienced many issues with invoking 'skills'. I routinely have a skill enabled, like Vivint smart home complete and when I try to call upon it Alexa tells me that it's not enabled. She then tells me the command to enable it, which I do, then she tells me the skill is already enabled. This happens quite often I find with different 'skills'. Sometimes Alexa totally misunderstands you. Example I enabled a skill called 'Chineasy'. I asked Alexa to ask Chineasy for today's lesson, but this is what she heard 'Actually secret today's lesson'.Also for me, the way you invoke these 'skills' is clumsy. You have to ask alexa to ask the skill to 'do something'. It's similar to when you're a kid and you're mad at a friend but need to ask them something, but instead of asking them yourself, you turn to a neutral party and ask them to ask your friend because you're not talking to them.",0.736842105263158,"positive"

We also have an elderly family member and we in stalled the buddy app to allow Alexa to text us in the event of an emergency. A nice extra emergency layer. We are amazed how well it hears from another rm. Even whispering its name works! Very sensitive micriphones. For the price, $39 on sale, it just cant be beat! Wifes not a tech person but she even warmed up to it once she saw how easy it is to use. Not sure what else we want it to do, but its nice to know that you can easily make it smarter or dumber, depending on what you want. Comes preinstalled with several useful apps/skills already, and those will easily get you started. We have it hooked to a nice boom box with killer speakers and a sub, so the music rocks, but the internal speaker is more than adequate for most tasks. If you use the external mini stereo jack, it is stereo, not mono. It easily paired with my UE Boom Bluetooth speakers, but as stated in the instructions, only 1 item at a time. So no stereo that way since my Booms sync differently, thats not the dots problem, just my speakers. For their entry Alexa unit, you cant go wrong. And no monthly fees!",0.772727272727273,"positive"

No problems, I hooked it up to a bluetooth speaker system that is part of my soundbar with my Smart TV in the bedroom and it sounds great! I do recommend adding external speakers if you do not plan on moving the Dot from place to place. If you have 2 units like I do, the main Alexa downstairs in the living room and the Dot in my bedroom, please make sure you change the name of the Dot so they do not access at the same time. There are 7 microphones in the Alexa and it picks up my voice from upstairs, that is how powerful this is. The Dot is the same way. My Alexa is ""Alexa"" and the Dot is ""Echo"" as per suggestions on the Alexa app on my iPhone, iPad, and MAC laptop. These are great and I do not have to get up and change radio or TV channels, just command them to do so. I do recommend buying the voice remote as well for extra convenience in case you are in a noisy environment so that Alexa or Dot can pick up your commands. I am very pleased with this.

Finally, the lights went out, but no 'OK' response.  It took her several more seconds for that to happen.  It's especially annoying for her lag in the mornings to turn on the 'Morning' lights.  You know, before I've had my coffee.  I wanted one in my bedroom because as a single woman I like the thought of being able to say ;""Alexa, turn on the outside lights' should I hear any noises.

5,"David Ashley","December 26, 2016","I ordered four of these as gifts, at about $40 each (on sale).  At the time I ordered, I already owned two Amazon Echos.These have most of the significant functionality of the Amazon Echo, but at a far lower price.  Functionality included:  WiFi, 7 microphones with very good voice recognition, LED ring with many segments (a pretty good light show), speaker.  Functionality not included:  won't function as a Bluetooth speaker, does not have volume adjustment ring (has buttons instead).I was very pleased.  Out of a slightly-larger-than-a-hockey-puck-sized device, I expected terrible sound.  But the sound is completely adequate, both in volume and quality.  It is perfectly adequate for listening to music in your kitchen or listening to audiobooks in your bedroom.  It is louder and clearer than I expected (but of course not as good as the Echo).  And of course since it has audio output (AUX plus Bluetooth), you can really crank up the volume with the right secondary device.Amazing functionality at that price point.  Amazing sound from something roughly the size of a hockey puck.This device is five stars, especially at the $40 or $50 price point.",0.866666666666667,"positive"
4,"Justin","November 29, 2016","Amazon Echo is awesome.For a long time i would use Pandora for music on my computer or tablet. When i get a phone call i usually race to the room to turn the music off and continue with the conversation. With the echo it's as simple as telling Alexa to stop. The device has multiple uses between music, ordering pizza or getting a uber or as simple just letting music shower you as you try and relax and watch a movie. I originally bought this for a gift but now seeing how it's used i'm definitely going to buy one for myself. It seems well built and functional and has amazing voice detection. I honestly haven't had an issue with it and neither does the person i bought it for.Only thing i wish it had was a more engaging AI. Cortana for example i feel has a bit of a personality. Alexa is better than Siri in my honest opinion. But for the price of this device it's well worth it. I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something like this. Makes a great gift. Awesome for an office (especially if you're a psychologist or such) having a voice activated music player makes it very easy to get a client, stop the music and continue with your session.",0.923076923076923,"positive"

I've loved the Echo every day since, especially seeing Alexa grow smarter and smarter and more capable every week as she learns new skills.I'm feeling the same way about the Echo Dot. I've used the Echo primarily as a music machine, and I'm using the Dot in a similar way in an upstairs room where the downstairs Echo would be out of range. Granted that the speakers in the Dot are not nearly as good as the Echo's 360-degree speakers, but with an auxiliary speaker that I connected to it, it sounds fine.It's a remarkable little device.",1,"positive"

5,"N8","November 13, 2016","I own three Echo products (Echo, Dot v1, Dot v2). I've arranged them strategically around my home, and unless there's a lot of noise interference one of them always hears me. My kids absolutely love them. Somehow, Alexa understands my three-year-old's requests, and we subsequently are listening to a lot of ""Peanut Butter Jelly Time"" by Chip-Man & The Buckwheat Boys. In spite of that, I still love having Alexa in my home.This product is amazing and comes at a great price. I'd probably buy more of them if I had a place to put them. The Dot is a perfect alternative to the much larger Echo, especially if you are like me and already have one and would just like to add voice automation to another area. When I purchased the cheaper 2nd gen Dot, I was expecting it to be lesser quality than the first, but it is most definitely not. The sound quality from the device isn't great, but that was expected. Hooking it up to a Bluetooth speaker is a breeze, but my usage of the Dot is primarily for home automation purposes. What is more important for me with this device is that the sound created can actually travel across the room if necessary, and I haven't been disappointed by it yet.",0.733333333333333,"positive"

It's kind of funny because our daughters name is Alexa and this is what this thing is called, so we have to be careful when saying her name. You can change the name she goes by, but we like it as it is. The app set up for the device walks you through every single step and is very helpful. I was concerned we wouldn't know how to use it because it's a hi tech thing but it's great. She understands things I wouldn't imagine she would and answers very fast. The initial set up takes about 10 minutes and then you're ready to go! This is a rest addition to a home!",0.75,"positive"
5,"W. Moore","December 21, 2016","This is my second Dot.I love them.They do not do a very good job of working together, though.Whichever one hears the command, is the one that executes it. Normally, this would be good, I guess. However, when I tell one to set an alarm, that is the only one that alarms, or knows I asked for the alarm. So, if I'm out of hearing range, and next to the other one - I don't hear it. Also, when the alarm is sounding, and I tell the other one to stop it, the alarm keeps sounding in the one it was set with.They are fairly limited in their function. They cannot find my wifi household control switches and socket - they are the wrong manufacturer??The switches do not require a hub, and are accessible from any web hotspot.They can connect to my other Bluetooth devices like the phones, but they cannot play the music on them.When the wifi goes out, they won't do anything except say they are having trouble connecting - try later.The Dot's are getting better, and the sound is very good.

From integrating smart plugs to playing me music to making me feel safer, I cannot say enough good things about this Echo Dot.  Other reviews have said she has problems hearing them but I have not found this to be the case at all.  I keep my only one in my bedroom for now (I plan to get more!) and she can hear me from my living room if I speak just slightly louder than normal!  She hears me over her own music too.  I have her play me soft jazz at night before bed, like I'm in a 5 star resort.  I have her play rain sounds when I can't fall asleep.  She reads (or plays) my latest book on Audible.  I have her integrated to one TP Link smart plug at the moment (totally plan to get more) and that was super easy and it works perfectly!  I live alone so I set up ""Ask My Buddy"" and have tested it and it works perfectly as well and brings me so much peace of mind!  I cannot say enough.  With time, more skills will be added and this will get better and better.

4,"DH","November 17, 2016","Picked up one from Bed Bath and Beyond.Voice commands and recognition work great. Only 4 stars because voice command flexibility is less than OK Google.Small learning curve to get used to the base voice commands. Could pick it up after 15 minutes of picking commands and searching for neat commands online. Minimalist packaging and directions/guide is discouraging for getting started.Past the basic commands, Alexa requires customization from ""skills"" or apps. You must find skills to enable that will meet your needs for recipes, news, trivia, weather, or other plethora of information. This is similar to shopping the Google Play store, where there are many interesting apps, but most don't work perfectly well.The first group of skills I added showed clunky voice command responses that required 10-15 seconds of listening to instructions that I could not interrupt. If skills are not well developed, long uninterruptable instructions are repeated.The current selection of skills is good, and has great potential for more to come.But Amazon should trim down the skills to an elite tiered skills that are well developed.",0.8,"positive"

3,"Patrick","January 5, 2017","Let’s take music out of the equation for now. The search engine is pretty bad for this device, OK Google is much better. Alexa when is the next season of the walking dead. “I couldn’t find the answer to your question”. Alexa what state is are code 818 in “I couldn’t find the answer to your question”. These are a few examples. Its novelty wears off pretty fast. It will read you news and weather and it’s fairly cumbersome to read a Kindle book. Can’t look up recipes I have in the Kindle library. To initiate a skill the exact words have to be spoken. I don’t know about you but once I get a few skills in my library, I can’t remember the exact words to use so I have to go to the Alexa app and lookup my skills to get the correct verbiage, again cumbersome. Music does OK but I have basically the same functions and programs on my smart TV so no big gain there. It’s a novelty for the most part. I see where it is usefulness for those with disabilities. I say this device is the beginning of a product line that will become more useful in the near future but as it stands now, it’s just OK. Definitely not a 5 star item in my world.",0.75,"positive"

5,"Justin R.","November 22, 2016","I own both this Echo Dot and the Amazon Echo, so I wanted to offer up my thoughts if anyone is wondering which one to get.If you're looking to see what all the fuss is about with voice activated stuff, I highly recommend the Echo Dot over the Amazon Echo. The only difference is a small, disappointing speaker that's not worth the additional $130 upcharge ($50 Dot vs. $180 Echo). You would be much better off hooking the Echo Dot to a better speaker system via the AUX output on the back. If you just want to ask Alexa simple things and not really play any music, you might even be fine without a speaker system. The Dot has a small built in speaker that amplifies Alexa's voice loud enough to hear.But, if you do want to hook up Spotify or Amazon Music and play it automatically through a speaker system, I highly recommend that. Setup is easy and you'll be able to call up custom playlists, full albums and more with ease. I've been really impressed at how good of a ""listener"" Alexa is.In conclusion, the Dot is pretty awesome and best paired with your existing home speaker system as opposed to buying the Amazon Echo unit by itself.",0.823529411764706,"positive"

I have had a hands on with regular echo and that was purchased by my grandmother and I had a full week with it and it was fantastic. I have now purchased an echo dot in white and it is just as good if not better. With the echo dot they basically cut off the speakers from the bottom. However this does not make this product perform worse than its bigger sister the echo. The fact that you can control your home with a simple command really shows that we are living in the future.Now the echo dot is excellent but it has a few flaws. 1.) The speakers are not very loud and they don't sound very good when turned up all the way. 2.) I don't like the glossy finish to much. This isn't like an iPhone 7 in jet black kind of smear but if you keep this is a place where everyone can see it it can be quite noticeable.

I upgraded to an Echo, which was up and running within five minutes of taking it out of the box.  I thought the Dot would be a useful addition. This evening I received the Echo Dot and quickly discovered that it had the same connection problems as the first one. My network can't find the Amazon-XXX network except once in 100 attempts.  When it finds the network it can't join it.  On the rare occasion when it joins the network, it can't complete the set up. I am willing to work with tech support to troubleshoot the problem, but there is no information in the published documentation or on line that tells me how to contact tech support.Additional information: Based on my interaction with Customer Service, I upgraded my review to four stars. It would merit five stars if Amazon included with the device printed instructions for contacting Customer Service.

I don't like that I have to pay for amazon prime in order for it to operate at its best. Like if I want to play a song since I don't have prime I have to direct it to my Pandora or other account of sorts.  Even if I did have prime (like people I know) it's hit or miss.  Half the time it only gives you samples.  I get a lot of ""I'm sorry.  I didn't understand the question you asked"".  If I want to ask a simple question I cannot just ask it and get an answer.  I have to tell it to ""go to google"" and find what I'm looking for also like you cannot ask followup questions after its response to a question.  After I saw the Google home and watched reviews of the two differences, I wish I would have bought that instead.  This one is nice but it's almost easier to use my phone most of the time.  Google home can do all the same things and better in some cases, it just doesn't have access to link up to some of the smart devices but I'm sure they are to come.

I can say without a doubt, the home controls, and the Harmony integration are fantastic. Sure, sometimes you get weird responses, but that's to be expected.I'm still waiting on full sonos integration. I did connect it to my Sonos, and it does work, but it requires so much interaction with the app anyway that it simply isn't worth it. Hopefull soon they'll get full integration going and that will no longer be necessary.The speaker actually isn't too bad. Sure, it's nowhere near as good quality sound as my Sonos speakers, and obviously not as good as the Echo either.

I immediately ordered two more.I keep one in our bedroom to turn everything off at night. One on my desk to tell me my schedule, remind me of meetings, add tasks to my to do list and control lights. And one downstairs to control everything.Siri is great, but you still need to pull out a device, press a button and say something.Alexa is just there, listening. Sometimes it activates accidentally, but that's not the end of the world.Having it be more open to developers (which I am) is great too. Most of the skills in the skills directory are crap, so being able to build (or find) my own is very helpful. That's not something you can do with Siri.Overall, I'm very happy with this.

Some questions/ tasks work better than others. The Alexa feature is great overall. I've learned that, for me, it is nice to provide weather updates, asking when my team is playing next, random facts, math, music, etc. However, the speaker on this is weak. I understand that for the price point, it's not necessarily supposed to compete with other bluetooth speakers straight up, but I was hoping it would at least double up as an alarm clock. Unfortunately, this probably wouldn't wake the lightest sleepers (which we are not!). I also know that it can be linked to bluetooth speakers, but I wasn't having any luck getting it to pair with the ones I've tried. Maybe I need to do more research into that, but I am still bummed nonetheless. My brother also received this product for Christmas and promptly returned it. I have confidence that Amazon probably made the other two versions better on the speaker output, but all in all, this is just relegated to a novelty item at this point for us.",0.785714285714286,"positive"

Not BAD mind you, just not great. As you can imagine the size difference alone between the two Echo products means that that sound quality of the Dot is nowhere near that of the full-size sibling (the Dot is tinny and slightly hollow).  I have also had far more recognition issues - not hearing me when I'm feet away - with the Dot whereas the full-size Echo was 60% successful hearing me from the same place from another room.  I have also found the Dot has far more connectivity issues when trying to connect for some basic commands or start an Audiobook.  What is it GOOD at however is being an addition to your nightstand.  It is small, it can function as an alarm, can be a bedside music player and has a nice sleep-timer feature as one would expect.  Bottom line: It can pretty much do everything that a full-size Echo can but in many cases not quite as well.  If this is your first Echo product I would suggest it's larger counterpart: you wont be disappointed.",0.5,"netural"

In other words I would love to wake up and play a song in the bedroom, then walk out into the great room and hear it. That leads to another issue. I would love to set an alarm to wake up to ,music, currently you can only do a sleep timer. Another issue is the HUE lighting interface with the HUB. Why can'tr I set the light to shut off at a specific time, or in a specific amount of time. ? It would be great to have it dim my light as I fall asleep then turn off the music.

We do have the nest thermostat and camera, but no lights.  The Dot has changed all of that.  Being able to put a few Dots around the house gives us Alexa where ever we could want  her.  Lights? well I recently found out that not all of the controllable lights are $50 each.  Actually they can be had for $10-15.  I am sure the sales will be big this holiday season also.  Call me lazy but being able to ask Alexa to turn on the bedroom lights without getting out of bed is wonderful!!  Even better, being able to shut the lights of after jumping under the covers is reason enough to start automating.  The Dot is small enough to be invisible on your bedroom furniture.  The sound of the speaker is better than most clock radio's, although you can plug in an expensive external speaker if you like.  By the way, Dot will serve as a wonderful alarm clock and weather station for starting out your day.  You a can buy 5 and get one free, Christmas shopping almost done.

The Dot not only works well at controlling appliances, but it also is a hoot for getting answers about other things. The weather, my upcoming schedule, the grocery list, who was Aaron Burr. She also tells jokes!It was very easy to set up (you'll need wifi and your wifi password). We paired ours with the TP-Link Smart Plugs and have since been learning about the many things that Alexa can do. My husband thought it was a waste of money (geez, what's wrong with plugging the mechanical timers on the lights?), but has warmed up to the whole idea tremendously. Our next purchase will be replacement wall switches that can link to Alexa to control the ceiling fans and lights, and most likely a thermostat as well.This would be a great gift to an older homeowner, especially someone with mobility issues, because it's all controlled by voice.",0.75,"positive"
2,"David","January 21, 2017","This review may change over time, but I am not impressed now.Echo is fairly dumb and does a poor job with contextual understanding.  Echo really is a voice control for home automation and not an active assistant.Echo is connected to the web.  I know Echo records every Echo command given and Amazon has full access to that content.  What I don't know if it records non-Echo commands, but I know it is always listening.  Privacy lost and you are more deeply embedded into the grid.The Google Amazon fight must stop.  Echo does not play with Google Music etc.Echo thinks my TV is talking to it.  Very often, without the word Alexa being said the Echo will start jabbering or playing a song while watching TV.  This is very annoying, but I have not looked into ways to fixing this yet.There is a lack of specificity when asking for a song or information.  Often we find that we ask for a song and get the wrong version or wrong song altogether.

By set up, I mean at bedtime I walked into the bedroom and told Alexa to dim the bedroom lights, arm the security system, turn down the thermostat, set my alarm for six am, and play meditation music. I woke in the middle of the night, and instead of fumbling for my phone, I just asked Alexa for the time. Then this morning, Alexa turned on the lights, told me the weather, what's on my calendar, and played some upbeat tunes while I got ready for work. I will get one more Dot for the kitchen/family room. The range is good, but if you have more than one story, you will need at least two. I also like that my security company will not let Alexa disarm the system. She can only arm it. The speaker quality is not terrible for this little disc, but an external speaker would help. It takes a little patience. Alexa does get smarter with use as it learns your voice and patterns (unlike Siri, which seems to be getting dumber). It's early, but I already see vast differences between the quality of Alexa and Siri. Lastly, I paired it with the Hue starter kit, so the Dot only cost about $41.

First off there are more differences between the two than just the speaker. I have no issues with the speaker on the Dot. It is loud and sounds great for its size. The issue on the Dot is the delay upon command, also loses Internet connection multiple times(my speed is 200mbps). I have the Dot hooked up to two smart light bulbs for each of my lamps and from time to time has trouble distinguishing between the two (even though they are both named bedroom 1 and 2). Now as far as the Echo (tall one) in my living room, I got it last Christmas and have it hooked up to one lamp. I have never had one issue. It responds to all commands instantly. Never lost Internet connection and works flawlessly. So if you are looking to buy Echo as you main device spend the extra money and buy the original(tall one) you will not be disappointed!!!

I knew it had the capability but never really considered it to be something we'd do on a regular basis but at least one a day we ask Alexa to open Pandora for us. I was worried that the sound wouldn't be too great since the biggest difference between the Dot and the original model is the speaker but it sounds great for the easy listening that we do.All around, for the price we paid, we couldn't be happier and will be ordering at least two more in the future for the bedroom and the kitchen.",0.777777777777778,"positive"

While you can sync Outlook to google, it doesn't work well with Exchange so if you're trying to work with your company email, it doesn't work well.  Also, Amazon took the time to program all kinds of Easter eggs into Echo (like answering how many pecks of pepper peter piper picked), but she doesn't understand basic requests like the amount of time it will take to get places based on maps and in spite of a great deal of voice training, still makes a lot of mistakes when interpreting requests.  The far field voice recognition only works about 70% of the time (I live in a 600 sq ft apartment), so I end up either shouting down the house or walking into the room where the dot lives to give the command in person.

My idea was to keep it in the car for bluetooth music and tether it to my phone for the Echo features (I own the Echo and Tap). The wifi setup is a bit clumsy, and irritating, but I got through it. When I got in my car, starting from cold, it reconnected once to the phone, but subsequent times it failed to reconnect. I went through the awful setup again with the same result: one reconnect then it never works again. Right now I have it just as a bluetooth player. It was a really great solution the few times it did work and I can only hope Amazon resolve the hotspot tethering issue in the future. A battery would be nice, so as not to cause a restart when you the start the engine.Update 12/17/16: I discovered that if I turn off the Personal Hotpot in the iPhone (iOS 10.1.1) and turn it on again the Dot will reconnect.

First i gotta say i do not own any time of bluetooth speakers so these are my first and for the most part just what i need; that been said I understand why this might not be the best option for someone who has plenty bluettoh speakers so if you have the budget go for the echo instead but honestly if you have a better pair of bluetooth speakers just connect them to this and you will get the same experience as the echo. I love that i dont have to get my phone and play something from it, i just ask alexa to do so. It has become my little P.A and it truly is a great device. What i mostly use this for is for my alarm, calendar, music and to- do lists.

Keep in mind, she will answer very basic questions and you have to ask her several times the same question but in a different format until she understands it. It's a cute interactive electronic and I'm sure as time goes by I'll get used to her but most of the time I could find the answer by using Google.

Sound quality is not great but more than acceptable for such a small speaker. My son certainly does not care about sound quality as I do.Another difference is that 2nd gen Echo Dot lowers volume when listening to the commands, while 1st gen keeps silent.I don't like its look very much though.

I believe I have personally sold about a dozen of them just by showing it to friends and family.I picked it up thinking my autistic, non-verbal daughter may find it entertaining and ""safe"" to talk to and so far I appear to have been right.  She asks Alexa for her ""news briefing"" every morning and takes turns with her sister asking for songs to play.  The echo does a phenomenal job of understanding her voice and Alexa's response is a warm and reassuring reward that makes her smile.  Both of my girls like playing ""Rock-Paper-Scissors"" with Alexa and asking the echo to help them with their homework.I was afraid that my daughter may become frustrated with the Echo's way of interacting with it (you have to say ""Alexa"" every time you want to engage it (no follow up questions) but the structure works for my daughter and she appreciates that short sentences work best (baby steps!)It is extremely easy to setup and looks great to boot.

But the sound from the Dot is excellent.  Maybe an audiophile would notice a difference, but I don't.  I find myself listening to a lot more music than I used to simply because it's so easy to instantly summon up a specific song or a long playback of many tunes.

Yes, the speaker is better on the 1st generation, but once I plugged this little guy up to our sound system I feel like I'm living in some movie from the future.  It's pretty fun to ask her random questions and have her tell us lame jokes.  The Flash Briefing is one of my favorite ""tricks"".  As a mom of two young kids, it's always a plus when you can get the low-down on current world events in a short amount of time.Of course, there's always a downside. On occasion Alexa will freeze up.  The blue light will continue to circle around and she has lost her connection a few times in the middle of telling me something or while playing music.  I don't think this is an internet issue because we have plenty of internet speed. Not sure what's she's up too.Overall, this is a pretty cool device.  It was pretty easy to set up and I was impressed by the number of ""tricks"" she has. Now if I can just get my kids to stop screaming, ""ALEXA!

Everything we have asked it to do it has done.So far the only problem we have incountered is it understanding what you are asking. And I don't believe it's the dots problem. It's the speed and the way you ask the question or the way you give a command. Once your echo recognizes your voice , and the way you give a command it works fine. I bought it for a Christmas gift for my wife who by the way is very technically challenged when it comes to stuff like this and she caught on right away.

I am not huge on sitting in front of my phone scrolling through apps to see what other people are doing with their lives.. i just don't care. I exist in place.. with that said.. i do like listening to music and getting general info when needed. I hate picking up my phone, tablet, or laptop just to do something quick like get a radio station or start a channel streaming to my blue tooth speaker. With the dot.. i can walk into the room, tell the thing to play whatever or give me an update and the speaker is rocking. I can come home now and toss my phone on the table without picking it up unless i get a call. The build of the device seems solid.. the internal speaker if fine for a simple answer, and the price is just awesome when you consider how it reduces the need to screw with a phone, tablet, or laptop for simple things. I used to think to myself.. was it not easier to push the power button on my boom box to get the radio on.. now having to use my phone, open an app, pair the speaker, play a channel/song it is a multi-step process.

Had my son not been here with his newer android phone the Dot would still be in the box.  Because none of my devices would operate the DOT I had to log onto my Amazon account on my son's phone. Fortunately he was here so I didn't have use a stranger's device (not recommended) or buy yet another android device just to use the Dot.  Since my son lives in Seattle and I don't, I will have to eventually buy a new device to take advantage of the more advanced capabilities of the Dot.It would also be nice if the dot worked with my Amazon Fire TV stick.

I've got the Dot in my bedroom and have started using it already for alarms, weather forecasts, the shopping list - basically, everything I would do with the Echo.  The Dot easily connects to a bluetooth speaker, so if the sound is important to you, that's an easy fix as well.  It is much smaller than I expected it to be - compared to the Echo, the Dot looks like a hockey puck!  Would highly recommend as an addition to the Echo family, but I wouldn't give up my original Echo, which has sound quality comparable to a Bose speaker.  I pre-ordered the Dot and got it the day after its release.UPDATE:  my Dot does not hear me as well as the full-size Echo - the alarm goes off in the morning and I practically have to scream at Dot to turn the alarm off - I ask in the morning for flash briefing and Dot tries to find me songs or doesn't understand my question.

The only real complaint I would have is that it can't coordinate at this point in time, I'm sure its coming, but right now can't change Philips Hue bulb colors. Alexa is a lot easier to communicate with than Siri is IMO. You don't have to ask precisely what you want and Alexa figures it out. For example in the Hue app my bedroom is ""My bedroom"" and if I say Alexa turn off the bedroom lights"" she'll do it. Whereas with Siri if I say that she won't know what to do. I have to say ""Hey Siri, turn off my bedroom lights"" so Alexa appears to be a bit better at recognizing regular human speech patterns. I will say you can ask Siri to do more things, at least currently, but Alexa seems smoother. Speakers are definitely not bad for such a small device, but seeing as I have a nice surround sound setup in my living room and a decent sound bar in my bedroom, the full size Echo was not necessary.

I have lots of appointments and things on there for the family and having a localized place that all could access was a nice idea.Unfortunately if I want it to remind me I need to add it.  with 7 ppl in our house and all of us having  Dr appts, school games, choir and Orchestra concerts, etc it's to much to add again to yet one more place.Lastly,  I added the ""Fortune cookie skill""  it is somewhat cute.. HOWEVER one of the fortunes it gave me said ""Fortune cookies taste like Sh*t"". now it did ""Bleep"" itself, but still my Boyfriends 7 yr old knew what it meant.Changed my reminder for a week from now to give me a chance to return it if I end up not wanting it.",0.846153846153846,"positive"

I already own a plethora of Amazon fire devices and have them in every room, which is how I play all of my content. But the Echo Dot cannot communicate with these, so I'm unable to say ""Alexa, play Metallica on my Livingroom FireTV"". No, that requires me to pick up the FireTV remote and press the button to talk to it's Alexa assistant.

Having utilized the full sized Echo for a bit before looking into the dot, I am very pleased with the capabilities of the Dot in comparison to the Echo.  Each has the same functionality, which while lacking in some places, is overall lightyears beyond the competition.  Biggest change is that the Dot does not have the built in speaker that the Echo has, and while that speaker is very good in terms of sound quality, this is not a major detriment.  It provides the Dot the ability to be a much smaller device, while still maintaining bluetooth capabilities to connect to any bluetooth enabled speaker by just saying ""Alexa, connect"" when the speaker is turned on (only caveat to this is that the speaker must have been synced to the Dot on one prior instance so it can be recognized, but that is required of any device to play through a speaker so no big issue).  Overall, great product, and very good for the price.",0.625,"positive"

You can turn the lights on and off through the Echo/Alexa, turn on the music, update shopping lists, set alarms, check your calendar, get a quick news report, and my favorite, check the weather.Also, this is quite affordable and time-saving (even better when there are sales) and I look forward to seeing how the Echo's capabilities will be expanded over time. You will have to do some in-home setup to customize your the Echo to your needs, which could become expensive depending on how many TP smart plugs you need. You will also need to hook it up to speakers to hear it.

For instance, being able to have a conversation and verbally program functions with Alexa (1 of the 3 Names you can choose to activate the A.I. interface). But hey, I'm not complaining.

I just spent time trying to find a work around and finally called Amazon customer service and was told that there is NO way to separate our lists!

My boyfriend has to pay a little more care to his enunciation to get Alexa to know what he's saying, but I'm sure if he did the voice training, the issues would go away. The skill selection is not bad, but still limited. I have been following some forums for the product and excited to maybe write something of my own for it. The highest volume setting isn't very loud, but works in the smaller setting it's intended for.In the morning, I ask Alexa to give me a rundown of the news, which includes NPR, BBC, local news, and the weather.

I can yell from the shower and she hears me all the way across the bathroom and master bedroom to change the station or change the volume. I also found some pretty funny Easter egg type things to ask Alexa and have been entertained.  I also added some apps in the Alexa app. If you don't have a speaker, get the full size. If you have a nice speaker (I have a UE Boom full size) then the Dot will be fine. I keep them connected to power and through a speaker cord. No big deal.

5,"Farhan K","October 24, 2016"," We've been the original Echo for close a year now and Alexa has become so entrenched in our daily lives now that there isn't a period of 4-6 hours that would go without us having to use Alexa for some reason or the other . We use Alexa for giving news updates, a voice activated jukebox to play our tunes on Spotify, set timers when I'm grilling/BBQ'ing and controlling our entire home's lights . It is definitely one of those things that you didn't you know needed until you actually own it and then cant do without it. And as we've gotten more used to it, we've finally decided that with the new Echo Dot,  Alexa can now live in our bedroom as well apart from our living roomHowever for new, first time users I must point out that overall we would describe our experience and relationship with Alexa as Love-Hate-Love. There are times when Alexa never ceases to amaze us with her speech intelligence and its uncanny ability to understand  what you want it to do (For Example ""Alexa, Bedroom Lights, On!""  or ""Alexa, Turn on the bedroom lights"" or ""Alexa, would you please turn on the bedroom lights"" all work  irrespective the figure or speech pattern you use) .  On the flip side of things , Alexa can be as intelligent and difficult as a toddler and just refuses to understand the most basic of commands/tasks. But I'd say , its miles better than any other Digital Assistant's we've used so for (Google Now, Siri & Cortanta) and like a child is evolving into something better every week with its frequent feature updates..Unboxing---------------Checkout my video for the unboxing , initial impressions and setup.Sound Quality & Using It---------------------------------The tiny speaker housed in the Dot is sufficient for most of its functions as a digital assistant such as reading news, setting reminders and home automation. The real advantage of the Echo Dot is that you can hook it up to your favorite  speaker  via aux cable or Bluetooth. The importance of this cannot be understated as we always felt our original Echo was not good enough as a music speaker. With the Echo this is no longer an issue. By itself the tiny speaker does sound very shallow and even Alexa's own voice sounds slightly different on it compared to the Lager Echo due to the lack of Bass and depth.- Another cool thing that I liked about the Echo Dot is that is is able to be powered by a regular Mirco USB Cable and a 2A phone charger/USB Port. So I dont have to use the supplied Power plug and instead I plug it in directly to my multi-port desktop charger that I use to charge my other devicesUpdated Processor & &Speech Recognition-----------------------------------------------------The 2nd generation has an updated and more powerful voice processor with ESP technology (Echo Spatial Perception) which gives it the ability to have the Alexa device closest to you respond in case multiple units hear your same command . In terms of overall speech recognition I could not see any noticeable difference in terms of the speed it which it processes commands or accuracy since they are still a function of the Alexa Software-Cloud platform. The ESP update is a software one which is now live across the 1st Gen devices as well. Check my video for it it actionCompared to the First Generation Echo Dot------------------------------------------------------- It is slightly shorter (1.3"" vs 1.5"") and lighter than the first gen unit- The volume ring has been done away with and replaced with physical buttons on the top- The speaker grille is now slat type holes rather than the tiny dot pattern perforation found on the original Echo or Echo Dot- About half the price of the 1st Gen model at $50  and DOES NOT require you to already own an Echo device to order it or place any limitations on the number of Dots you can order. . On a side note, I really do feel that the 1st Gen.Dot early adapters got the short end of the deal here and  could have done more for them to justify the price difference for a more expensive, less powerful 1st Gen unit.- Now comes in a choice of two colors, the original came only in black- Unlike the first Gen Dot, Does not come with an Aux cable to connect your speaker, you'll have to bring your own- For new owners who were on the fence of trying out the Echo/Alexa , the time and price couldn't be better !Using Two Alexa Devices in Simultaneously for Music-------------------------------------------------------------------You can use two Alexa (Echo/Dot) devices independently from each other in each room of your house i.e each device is also capable of playing its own music independently but the only thing is that you can use one streaming service on a single device at a time for example if you are streaming on Spotify in your living room , you cant use the same Spotify account to stream different music in your bedroom . You can choose another service such as Pandora or Prime music . While using the same music service (eg Spotify) it does transfer seamlessly from one room to the other at the same point- I am also currently using the 30-Day Trial fo Amazon Music Unlimited Echo Plan , and it is currently allowing me stream music on both my Echo devices in each room independently using Amazon's service. I will update this section if it continues to allow me to do so after the trial period coverts into paid subscriptionCompared to Other Smart Home Assistants------------------------------------------------------Compared to the other major entry in this segment -The  Google Home which is due to be released on 4th Nov (at the time of this review) offers better hardware, a much deeper integration in the Google EcoSystem (Gmail, Calendar etc) and offers Google Assistant which offers better predictive help like its time to leave for the Airport (from scanning your Gmail) etc. Where it seriously lacks is the amount of 3rd party support , Home automation integration it offers at launch compared to Alexa which has a two year lead in this game. It must be noted that Alexa too was was similarly bare boned at launch.Final Thoughts-------------------Whether you are look for the absolute best Home assistant available at the moment or just looking to dipping your fingers and testing out the home digital , connected smart home thing - WITHOUT breaking the bank, you cant just go wrong with the Echo Dot at 50 bucks. Amazon has clearly thrown the Gauntlet here - Your move Google/Apple",0.767441860465116,"positive"

I've installed different skills, like Chuck Norris facts, jokes, etc, I've connected it to my Amazon Prime account and even set up a playlist that the Dot can play while I'm working in the office. Lately, though, the Dot will start playing a song from my playlist, but then stop playing in the middle of the song. Even though she's connected to the Wi-Fi service, and acknowledges that she is connected, she won't play any of my music on Amazon Prime. She's never had a problem playing this before, but in the past week, she's been having major difficulties. I've followed the advice of one Echo Dot user who gave the simple advise of unplugging it and then plugging it back in again, which I did. The Dot reset, and played most of one song before it stopped playing music again. I really don't know what to do, and for this reason, I've grown to resent the Dot. :(",0.5,"netural"

I connected the dot to my Honeywell thermostat and Echo would change the temperature when asked with no issues. Adding items to my Alexia shopping list app worked flawlessly and setting a timer or alarm worked with no problems.The issues that I had were, when I asked simple questions that I normally would search on Google, she would consistently say ""Sorry, I couldn't find the answer to your question"" I just gave up and used my iPhone to find out the answer since it was much quicker.

3,"WayneWireless","December 28, 2016","We were excited to receive our Dot, and set it up right away. Maybe we expected too much. Are you accustomed to Google speaking answers and descriptions to just about every question? Then you will most likely find that Alexa is cool and can be entertaining, but her knowledge base is very limited. And, Amazon has a lot of work to do on reliable voice recognition, never mind natural VR.Ask for a simple, well-known recipe, and it's confused. Ask for pizza in my city of Lancaster, and no matter how you word it, Alexa keeps giving just one location 9 miles away.Today is Dec. 28. I asked if the Buffalo Bills fired Rex Ryan, or if the Bills fired their head coach, and if the Bills have a new coach. No answer was correct. Amazon could not understand Fireworks for New Year's Eve.If in fact Echo and Dot (each of which has the exact same artificial intelligence) are equipped with natural learning, then each will be awesome in the future.

3,"Evan","December 29, 2016","It's cheaper than the echo so I can afford to have one in multiple rooms. The speaker does the job but isn't great. I can't really here it over the dishwasher when it's running. Biggest draw back is that each unit is independent so they don't communicate with each other. So if I play music on one, none of the other dots or echo's play. Also it is nearly impossible to look up individual episodes of podcasts. The voice control works really well, but the mobile controls absolutely suck! You are pretty much limited to pause/play and volume controls. There is no search function for individual podcasts which is plain stupid. Also the Alexa app is brutally slow and there is no search function for the ""skills."" Which doesn't really matter because the skills that are available are pretty much useless.Overall I do like it. It's cool tech and it does the job, but serious upgrades are need mostly with the software if they want to compete with Google.",0.625,"positive"

That cost a star.Otherwise, the device is great.  I wanted it to travel with and use with a stereo at home as the original unit has no headphone jack.

3,"BethanyLiz","November 13, 2016",". I had the first generation DOT and over time, it just stopped recognizing my voice commands unless I screamed at it. I worked with customer support and for several weeks we factory reset it twice (no small thing as you have to reset your WIFI, reset skills and do the voice training all over again). It also stopped recognizing my Oonz bluetooth speaker. Finally, customer service sent me the new DOT as a replacement. For a time (one or two weeks) the new device worked great.However, I'm having the same voice recognition issue. I'm having to practically stand over it and scream at it. It does however recognize my bluetooth speaker but for how long, who knows? I really like the echo as it has great potential. i like the new Amazon music service, the ability to set multiple timers and manage my Phillips Hue lights, ask for the weather forecast and time.

Then all the other things it can do just make it a cool device.  I will eventually purchase some wifi enabled smart plugs and really see what it can do.  For $50 ($40 when on sale) you can't go wrong.  Only improvement I would suggest is adding a backup battery in case of power loss.  Alexa told me that she does not have a battery (yes I asked her).UPDATE: Two small frustrations that I have noticed lately.  1) I use it as an alarm clock and it has a hard time hearing my voice in the morning when I try to set it to snooze.  2) When attempting to cancel my alarm, with more than one alarm set, it talks through all that want to be cancelled.  Problem is that I am usually in the cycle with the alarm I want off.  Also, at 5:30 AM going through all alarms is kind of annoying.

4,"Shea Storer","January 5, 2017","Good needs to get better. Its just so dumb. It can do so much but it can not understand anything that isn't exactly how it wants it. It also needs to learn to tie what you are asking together. For instance if you ask it something it will not get it, you ask it another way it still doesn't understand. Between multiple questions it should tie together you are asking about something specific. Each request is independent from any other request except with music. Has potential barley a 4 star rating could make it to 5. However sometimes the horrible bing results make it a 2. I would prefer to choose my search results and change them to more accurate info on google. At one point I was asking it what happened in 2007 and it told me the Vietnam war and Tienanmen square. I complained and it was fixed. However I have seen other poor to inaccurate information.

The Echo Dot brings a new level of hands-free voice control to our home which has definitely made multi-tasking much easier along with making it easier to listen to music!We do not have a speaker system set up to the Echo Dot, but find that the volume is enough that we can hear it throughout whichever room we are in. We haven't even had to turn it up from the original volume of the device -- only down when it's late.Only issue we've run into is the Echo Dot in the living room sits by the TV, and occasionally Alexa thinks the TV is summoning it.

The main reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of voice memos.

I think of the Echo Dot as a way to quickly get the weather if my phone isn't handy and it is a novelty for guests or grand kids, but its best use seems to be in providing trivial pursuit type of information- nice to know, but not really useful.  I know, it is only as good as the questions asked, but my experience has been that asking specific questions often gets you the 'Sorry, I can't find the answer to the question I heard"" response.It is a fun toy, but I wouldn't bet my term paper on Alexa's information.The range of the unit is very good.  Our house is large and Alexa can pick up a question from quite a distance.

5,"Rafael Ivan Soto","December 6, 2016","Amazing! I have an accent (1st language is Spanish) and Alexa adjusted to it in no time. I paired it with my Amazon tap for better sounds or to listen to it around the house. It is of great assistance. Every morning, Alexa wakes me up and have her give me a news flash and weather report, while I am changing. Then, I play some tunes while having my coffee and getting ready. At night, it plays relaxing sounds to help unwind before going to bed.  Another great feature, it is the to do list and shopping list. Everytyime, I am at the house and need something, I just say it and tell her to add it. Now, you don't to scream or be close to Alexa. The Echo dot works even when you speak in normal voice and not facing it. Honestly, it is a great tool and a purchase, you won't regret. Not a fab.

4,"gonzo","October 24, 2016","I would have given it 5 but Amazon installed a cheaper DAC in order to save $1.50 a dot. For those who don't know what a dac is it's a Digital to Analog Converter. It only comes into play if you use the 3.5mm jack to output to a speaker or receiver. I have one dot connected to my receiver this way on order to get higher quality audio compared to Bluetooth so it's a bit disappointing. The remote isn't a plot it's very useful in certain circumstances. I do a lot of work outside in the yard ,also grill a good bit. The door is great at pairing with my ue boom 2 and since the dot is inside the remote is a very convenient way to control it from outside. It has microphone control,skip ahead,back ,volume controls and play/pause. Much easier than using a phone. Also I have the remote paired with the dot I have plugged into my receiver in my entertainment system so if I'm playing music loud in the house it's better to use the remote rather than yell across the room.",0.75,"positive"

I have them spread throughout my house and they have already become a regular part of my routine. They're connected to all of my home automation devices and that has already expanded to include some new devices. While it doesn't compare to the overall sound quality of the full size Echo, the dot is capable of putting out more than enough noise to jam to music or to hear a lovely story from. My wife and I laughed hysterically when we asked Alexa to sing us a song. What a fun easter egg! The more I use the dot the more I find the device to be more and more functional.Support is great for the dot with peripheral options available from big and small brands alike.

I love the fact that I can connect her using bluetooth to my iPhone and use the music on my iTunes account through that and listen to my music. Even though Prime Music has got some really great music on it sometimes it doesn't have song that I want so I can go to Apple and sometimes Apple doesn't have it so I'm going to Prime Music.

I thought, for instance, I could control the Fire TV (for instance tell it to play something on it), but you can’t do that.2. The device gets disconnected from the internet frequently in an area of the house I have good reception in and never had any problems.3. Related or unrelated to it, TuneIn Radio barely works (at least with my stations) from the dot, but if I put my phone at the same place and play from it, it works perfect.4.

It seems like the software can only handle very simple questions and commands at this point. ""What time is it?  How many ounces in a pound? What is the weather forecast?  Play a song from Adele.  Order more paper towels. Etc.""  Once the glow of this cool new device wears off (within a few days of purchase), I found I had very little use for it.

Secondly, I wanted something that I can easily set up and use in my office without having to fiddle with Bluetooth devices or my phone.The Dot is perfect! It is compact enough that it doesn't take up a lot of space on the desk. Additionally, the speaker is adequate, although not as good as the one on the Echo. It's actually just right for the small work space, and the sound is much better than what emits from my laptop. I mainly use it for music and getting information quickly and reliably.If you have a ""smart"" home, then this is the perfect addition, as well.

If you have prime its great, but make sure you turn off automatic ordering because you CAN buy things accidentally.  I am also disappointed that while she will connect with 2 way wifi speakers, she will not extend to those external microphones the same way Siri will.

4,"CherAmi","November 4, 2016","Pros: answers questions quickly and accurately. Home automation works great. I use it to control my phillips hue lights, set timers, alarms, get conversions of measurements while cooking. Very handy.Cons: the only time the echo dot seems to not hear me, is when I'm playing music from it, or when I have an alarm set for it that goes off. There have been scenarios where I set a wake alarm, then try to verbally tell echo to stop, but the wake word doesn't work and so she doesn't respond. I assume the alarm noise or music drowns out my voice. And so I end up using the phone app to kill the alarm.Not game breaking as I can work around that. Conclusion: Overall very happy with it. If you are looking to automate your home, or finding yourself googling things frequently, what felt initially like a neat gimic soon became something I realized made a lot of things more convenient for me the more I used it.

I bought two of the Echo Dots, and put one in the bedroom and one in the basement. I primarily use these to do voice commands to WeMo switches, although we do find ourselves playing music over them as well, and it doesn't sound too bad... basically like any other small Bluetooth speaker you've ever used, except way smarter.The only issue I've had is that I couldn't get these to stay connected to wifi when they were connecting via my wifi range extender. As soon as I'd unplug the range extender, they'd work... so that's probably more of an issue with the range extender than these units, but not sure. I just renamed my extended range network and sync'd these to the primary wifi network off my main router, and they're rock solid.",0.625,"positive"

I am a big electronics guy and have my old yamaha receiver and good old school bose speaker set up and this blew me away. Being able to have it play music without the pain of finding my phone and letting it die slowly just to listen to music is worth it alone. Not to mention the crazy amount of skills and features. I have a smart tv but no smart hub. I am looking into buying one and will update this when I do. As for its quality that is another area where I was blown away but what do you expect from amazon!! Great quality and unsurpassed usefulness. It even tells my baby boy stories! He doesn't understand what or who is talking but he finds it entertaining!

We do not get search results when asking questions about half of the time.Flaw 2: Adding new accountsWhen adding a new account, the device loses the skills that you have enabled.  Presently, at the time of this review there is not a way to bulk enable skills from your skills library.Flaw 3:  It cuts out semi-frequently when giving results to a question and even a few times when being asked to play a song.

We ask it to turn off the lights using a wink hub, lights stay on and dot replies OK or the lights instantly go off, then the dot takes 2 to 3 minutes to respond OK. Ask it to tell us a joke, it tells the joke, but stops before giving the punch line. We have a full size echo that works fine, and we have tried moving the dot next to the echo to see if it was having issues with the wifi range, no change. Reset to factory defaults and setup from scratch, no change. We finally contacted tech support, who where useless. Bounced us around to 4 different techs in less then 5 minutes, where hung up on then finally told the case would be escalated to tier 2 support.

Setting alarms for the morning, checking the weather, and random fun other questions you can ask her - it's all so great. I also have it connected to my Phillips Hue bulbs (pretty straight forward, just needed a Phillips Hue online account and access to the bridge one time) and that's really handy as well. Way easier than taking out my phone and the Hue app.The speaker is surprisingly good. As a speaker buff myself, I would never choose this to listen to music for extended periods of time, but it is definitely loud enough for the whole room.

I have, however, been using it to play music constantly from Amazon Music and I am thrilled with it. I started adding songs to My Music in Amazon Music, but I love to just ask Alexa for a specific artist I love. She shuffles it up, plays my songs, skips when there is a song I don't like, pauses, resumes, adjusts volume levels...It's great! If the volume is up too high, though, she does have trouble hearing me from another room (I have a very small house so I am never far away from it). But if I move closer or raise my voice a little, she gets it. I bought one for my father for Christmas and I can't wait to see if he loves it as much as I do.

But more often than not if you try to ask a more complex question it will not find the answer for it. We, my fiance and I, have found it more difficult to use the Echo Dot for actual use outside of playing music or finding how cold / warm it is outside. I am not sure if it is a problem with the BING browser that it is associated with or if it is something else, or just not recognizing the speech clearly enough. We have also have had a somewhat mixed result of the fact that the Dot will not always recognize our voices, even when the TV is on quietly. We will have to mute completely for it to fully recognize our voices. I do like it overall, it is a great concept, but I just wish that it was a bit more ""complete""",0.6,"positive"

I already had a really nice bluetooth speaker to use with it so I didn't feel the need to spend the extra money on the full size Amazon Echo.  My 16 year old daughter also liked it a lot so I recommended that she get the portable ""Tap"" which I feel was a partial mistake since you have to push a button on the ""Tap"" before it will respond.  The ""Dot"" on the other hand answers immediately to a simple voice command without having to push a button and that's exactly the way it should be.  It recognizes many voices just fine from a man to a woman to our teenagers.  It's also quick to respond with the music to play that was requested.  I've been seriously thinking about buying a few more Dot's but, I don't need a full six pack of them before I get some kind of discount.

Should be able to select which search engine to use.  BING is really slow.  We also got a GOOGLE HOME for Xmas and it is noticeably faster.  The echo with BING search engine is like a dial up connection while the GOOGLE HOME is instant.Aside from the speed, both do basically the same thing.  Although the GOOGLE HOME was rushed to market for the holiday rush it is short on being able to do as many tasks as the ECHO.  Also the echo has the ability to blue tooth speakers or hard wire speakers which is a real plus.I am sure down the road the GOOGLE home will be updating the software to be able to handle a lot of the services the ECHO can already.The speed of the ECHO DOT though is the reason I am giving it 3 out of 5",0.545454545454545,"positive"

My aunt loves using it for Pandora, paired to a bluetooth speaker. My uncle thought it was hilarious you can ask her how to make cocktails (and can add the missing ingredients to your shopping list). I like that I can call from bed to change the temperature on my Nest thermostat or switch my Philips Hue lights. My co-worker likes asking for recipes and setting timers. My sister has Alexa settle trivia debates (it turns out -40 is the same temperature in centigrade and fahrenheit).It does so much, you find new features all the time. Whether it's giving stock prices based on ticker symbols, or telling you how many teaspoons are in a half cup when you can't find a measuring cup, Alexa can handle it faster than you can unlock your phone.",1,"positive"

Yes it dose need some setting up with a phone or tab. once done , they can listen to…really what cant they listen to, intune, Pandora, auditable, then then they can make phone calls with the third party app, and control the lights with wemo plugins, and control the light with hue . so yes some times alexa cant hear you, or even understand you which is only about 3% to 5% of the time, which is not bad with how new this tect is.

It is enabled in the app. I ask Alexa to buy something. It finds it in the order history and asks ""Would you like to buy it now?"" I answer very clearly ""yes"". Alexa repeats ""Would you like to buy it now?"" I repeat ""Yes"" however Alexa proceeds to tell that it cannot tell if I want to buy the item. I tried this 5 times and also tried other answers such as ""I do"", ""Buy it"" but nothing works. This would be huge deal for someone who was actually planning to use Alexa to make purchases on Amazon. For me it is not the primary use case so taking off 2 stars only.I hope Amazon will fix this asap!",1,"positive"

I've used other voice command modules and this one is reasonably accurate.  I rarely have to repeat things.  The trick with integrating this with a home automation system is to name your devices and groups with things that are very easy to say and very short and distinct, it picks up numbers pretty well (i.e. ""Group 2"" instead of something overly wordy).It's a bummer Google won't integrate with it because they're pushing their own platform, but this works well enough and Amazon seems like they're improving quickly.

I'm currently listening to the NPR 'Democracy Now' podcast from today via TuneIn.  I've enabled BBC, NPR, weather, and other 'news' in my NewsFlash.  I've plugged my computer speakers into the aux plug in the Dot, so I can listen while at my computer.  Later, I'll move the Dot to bedroom and plug her in there.  Someday, I'll get another one, but for now, I'm loving having just one!!  Easy set up.  I can see her on my iPhone, my Kindle and via Amazon desktop.  All too fun.

I'm really glad I did. We've only been using Alexa and the dot for 2 days but I feel like I've already gotten my $$ worth out of her. We didn't have a radio hooked up in our house, I know right, get with the times. For just the music alone it's worth the buy! I love that she's able to hear me no matter what room I'm in on the floor of the house we have her in. She's understood what I've asked every single time. I love the ability to get the latest news, weather, and more in an instant. I love that I'm able to set alarms, reminders, and even order via the dot. (Although I've not done this yet, I did set a passcode. It worried me that my toddler could purchase things if he wanted!) Which brings me to the fact that she even understands my 4-year old. He's asked her to play some of his favorite songs and she does, right away. I am an android user and I thought ""I don't need this, we have google and it does everything this alexa does!"" Which is true, but I am so glad we have this now. I'm not sure if I would have preferred one of the bigger models or not, but this has great sound and works very well. My only regret is that I didn't buy one for every floor of my house.

3,"John","December 18, 2016","I lurched two of these and a Bose Bluetooth speaker from QVC. I like the concept but it lacks a few freatures/ capabilities I would have expected. 1. There is no way to schedule and event. For example play "" Happy Birthday at 8 AM tomorrow"". 2. There is no keep alive between the echo an the Bluetooth speaker. As a result the Bluetooth device drops off after an hour or so. You must ask Alexa to reconnect the Bluetooth after an inactivity period. 3.  Finally it does not have skills to connect to Hive home automation products if you live in the US. It seems like only the UK has this option. My comment 1. Is the most discouraging. This functionality seems to be a an obvious oversight. One last thought is the skills to Ale a interface. You must reference the skill name to use each skill.

For example, I ask Alexa ""What's the forecast today"" and she gives me a detailed forecast, even better than Siri. However, I do find that she routinely doesn't have the answer I'm looking for if I ask a general question.The setup wasn't as easy as I thought it would be. Luckily I'm pretty good with tech items and when the setup didn't go as planned I could troubleshoot it. Had someone else in my family be attempting the pairing to the wifi, it would have needed a support phone call — because it just wasn't working properly.For $50 — this thing is a no brainer if you don't mind talking to devices. It's worth it to me just to say ""Alexa, play some dinner music"".",1,"positive"
5,"Deborah Boone","January 17, 2017","I can't claim to be a super user yet but so far I'm having a blast with the new echo dot.  Often times while watching a movie or show, I have to ask for the one IPad we have to inquire on other roles an actor played or their age, etc.  I could use my phone but that would require reading glasses.  Now I can ask Alexa.  I can get the forecast for my area, calorie count for various items, and even inquire on the status of my recent Amazon package.  I couldn't justify a second IPad for such inquiries so this was a great find.  The internal speaker works for what I need so no need for us to hook up to another speaker.  Oh, and I am able to play Amazon Prime music which is nice when I'm working in the kitchen.I wasn't sure if this base model would be the way to go instead of the pricier Echo but so far so good.",0.833333333333333,"positive"

3,"Kay Linebrink","January 20, 2017","A cute toy. Sad that it was ordered for Christmas and it was received on December 28. That took most of the fun out of it. It really does not have much value as a work tool. Actually it has very limited use as a toy also. Without a computer of some sort, you won't be able to look up how to control it and to find the apps and skills that can be installed on your account. If you are looking to get one, make sure you try the inexpensive ""Dot"" first. Ours has already lost its luster as a toy and would need several hundreds of dollars of add ons to revive much interest in it. I would have given it a little lower rating except it came as advertised  and I was ready for the limited usefulness it has. It was a stocking stuffer after all, it didn't need to be more than a novelty The real presents were under the tree!",0.666666666666667,"positive"
5,"Carol G.","December 9, 2016","Got my Dot three days ago and can only say that I'm just having too much fun with it.  Within two hours I had it hooked up to my Bowers and Wilkins speaker(I opted to use a cable rather than Bluetooth in this application) and had it controlling my family room lamp via a TP-link lightbulb and my Christmas tree lights with a TP-link plug. The whole setup is amazingly quick and simple as long as you follow the instructions given in the Alexa app and the Kasa app which controls the TP- link devices. And no hub needed with the TP-link devices ... It doesn't get any easier!By the time the afternoon was over, I'd already ordered more Dots, plugs and light bulbs for Christmas gifts ... And yep, another for me.  Received them late yesterday, and now have my second one installed in the bedroom blue toothed to a small speaker/lamp combo.  Frankly, the sound quality of the Echo Dot is good enough for bedside by itself, but I wanted to see if pairing would be a hassle.  Nope ... Another easy installation.Lots of useful skills available for the Dot, but also a lot of junk, too.  Living alone, elderly, and with an iffy health status, 'Ask My Buddy' was of particular interest.  Upon running a test after setup, my son and two friends were notified by text, email and phone that they should check on me because I'd triggered an alert.  Superb!  It isn't going to help if I can't speak to trigger Alexa, but there are much higher odds that I'll trip over one of my 100# dogs in the middle of the night and break something which may prevent me from getting to a phone.  But Alexa's hearing is quite good so she'll likely respond if I yell at her.I haven't as yet been able to stump her on a music genre, but she hasn't been able to locate one or two rather obscure songs I've asked for.  She's also so friendly and poltite when carrying out a task that I find myself saying 'thank you' as if she was real.  In all, Amazon did a great job with this little jewel.  Love it, and will be buying a couple more to cover the rest of the house.",0.722222222222222,"positive"

When I disconnect Alexa from the Bluetooth, Alexa automatically reattaches to it in seconds.  I did a workaround by unplugging the Bluetooth receiver when I'm not using it. This seems to do the trick. However it would be nice when I tell Alexa to disconnect if I could totally disable Bluetooth in the Echo.

If you want to use it to control other devices in your home, you have to purchase not only special wireless enabled light bulbs and switches to control these devices (which are VERY expensive at the moment) you also have to purchase a separate bridge to connect the devices to the Alexa app.So, if you want this little gadget to do all of the things as advertised, you are easily looking at spending another $200-$300 depending on how many things in your home you want her to control.",0.75,"positive"

I'd  love a feature of ""streaming/playing"" the same songs simultaneously throughout all my echos yet I'm sure this is something Amazon is working on. A small CON: Echo Dot has a delay in understanding commands. Although they are the exact verbiage & commands I give Alexa - Echo Dot has a problem understanding/delay in understanding the commands. Upon my asking a kiosk rep about this delay - they gave me a card w/tel. # for Customer Service. The number belongs to Kindle Customer Service so don't bother calling.

4,"EMOlson","November 12, 2016","My big problem with the Echo was that there was no way to connect to SONOS.  (I took off two stars for that.)The new DOT has the same issue, but I am only taking off one star.  The reason for that being when you Jerry-rig a connection using a BT reciever you loose the Echo or Dot speaker, which is a bigger deal for the Echo because you have paid $120 more for that speaker.So you can Jerry-rig a connection...  You have to buy a Bluetooth receiver, pair it to the Dot, connect it to the line-in on a Sonos Play, and then swithc your Sonos to ""line-in"".  Problem solved? ....Well, ""Yes"" and ""No""!There are still two major problems.  The first is that linking other Sonos zones doesn't work that well (Sonos is great but not designed for live streaming).  Which leads to the second issue (which is a minus 1 star for DOT); if one wants to hear Sonos in multiple rooms you have to link your zone to another input or zone (bypassing the DOT).  The problem here is that the DOT is still sending it's sound to the Play unit which is no longer listening.  Your Alexa is mute when connected to BT!The easy solution is to tell Alexa ""disconnect bluetooth""...  the problem is that the DOT immediately reconnects to bluetooth because BT receiver's are designed to auto-reconnect to previously paired devices.  This means you have to either ""forget"" the connection or unplug the BT receiver...... What a pain!TO THE DOT ENGINEERING TEAM: come on guys, you are getting so close!  First and best solution: GIVE US A SONOS SKILL.  I""LL GIVE YOU SIX STARS....  Short of that us a firmware upgrade for both Echo and Dot that allows us 1) the option to keep the speaker on when paired to BT and 2) to completely control DOT's BT by voice.... Disable the auto-reconnect feature in the DOT, it is not needed.  Do that and I will change to five stars.",0.470588235294118,"negative"

What chinese place should I try tonight? and so on) She is really good about facts and stats. Checking the Seahawks schedule, checking the weather and so on. I plan to expand my smart home with a few LifX bulbs and Lifx Z strips but havent got to that yet. I hope they come up with a update for Alexa to better improve her conversations.

They should give it more personality and change up the way she answers questions when she didn't know the answer. They should make it so that you can have followup questions like a normal conversation. Plus, it cannot answer alot of question. Hopefully, they can improve this area. Also, it doesn't work well in a noisy environments. You have to speak very loud,  even then, it doesn't understand you at times.Alexa, though, works well when ambient noise is at a minimum. The another thing that does well is voice commands in home automation. I have a home theater and implemented this along with Harmony Hub, Tplink, and Lutron Caseta dimmers.

You'd figure something like this would be able to, but instead you have to go into the settings app for this and other things. There are other questions as well where it fails to understand what you're asking in ways that Google Now on Android phones seems to have no problems understanding.

5,"KEN RUDA II","October 25, 2016","I love the Echo Dot! It works great! I'm using my Amazon Echo Dot (2nd Generation) to stream special piano playing encoded software CD albums that I uploaded to my Amazon Cloud Music Library Account. This music is streamed from the cloud via my Amazon Echo Dot which output is wirelessly connected to an attached Bluetooth receiver attached to the OMNI-IN L&R RCA inputs on the I/O center of my Yamaha Disklavier Mark IV Player Grand Piano. The special Disklavier-encoded music (signal) will actually cause the keys and petals to play music on my player grand piano. Unlike the Amazon Echo the Amazon Echo Dot can redirect its output via Bluetooth. Which is so much better than running an unsightly audio cable across the room from the Echo Dot to my piano. With this setup I can now control the playback of any song or album that I have uploaded to my Amazon online music library with a simple voice request to Alexa!Want to play a certain song in your library. Ask Alexa by name:""Alexa, Play THE STAR-SPANGLED BANNER'""Want to play all songs on a particular album in random order then say shuffle instead of play:""Alexa, Shuffle Album ISN'T IT ROMANTIC""The Echo Dot will quickly locate the album in my Amazon Music Library and stream it to my piano! It's fast and it works fantastic for me!I can also as Alexa to Pause, Stop, Next Song, Repeat Song, and more.Ever wonder what the name or artist of the current song playing? Just say, ""Alexa, What is this song?"" And she will not only tell you the title and but the artist and other information attached to the song's tags you entered when you uploaded the music.This system works amazingly - right out of the box. If you have another older model of the Yamaha Disklavier with CD capability this solution will likely work for you, too!  Just rip your current pianosoft plus audio CD's to 320-kbps MP3 files and upload them to your Amazon Cloud Music Account.You'll need to set & keep the volume level on the Echo Dot to 10 since the analog-MIDI signal needs to be strong.  I notice problems with notes dropping out and not being played is it's set below level 4.  Just just the Disklavier Volume Level to control it.Someday maybe someone will write an Alexa SKILL that can control the Disklavier Volume! I'm hoping one will come out that will let me set the Echo to DISKLAVIER MODE... Like: ""Alexa, Set Disklavier Mode"" which will automatically limit the songs only you your Disklavier Albums and and redirected the Echo Dot's output to the piano.  Because now if I get tongue-tied and say the wrong name of the song it will play a song from the Amazon Prime Music Store - which will MOT play the keys on your piano but will play the audio on your piano's speakers - which is okay, but with the piano part which is boring in my opinion.However, if you can play the piano - with your hands - it might be fun to play along with your favorite song! Imagine playing along with a recording of your favorite Orchestra.Enjoy your Yamaha Disklavier Piano even more... Get the Echo Dot today!",0.724137931034483,"positive"

No RMA, no label, just ""try running setup on another network"".  Duh, it's dead, Jim. Actually not quite - it receives power and lights the little yellow LED. Never finishes (or starts?) booting. No light ring activity. No voice greeting. No log entries suggesting she heard me but couldn't answer.

It won't hear me at all if I am lying in bed.  Kind of the point here is that I don't want to have to yell in my bedroom as I am in an apartment.

Even though the app asks for permission to use location services on the device, it does not appear to use them.

I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend and basically every single question he has asked it (and me) has been a ""hmm I don't know what you are asking). It plays music and tells weather ok but I have an ipod/pandora for music and can get weather easily. i wanted interaction, asking ""google"" questions on the fly while watching a show and wondering about a fact or person...it never has an answer.. News is useless, basically pre-recorded junk that doesn't update for 24 hours or more at a time. I'm surprised so many people rate it so high. I was looking for something much more interactive. Is google home or the other Echo better? This is a waste of money to me as I already have pandora and a bluetooth speaker, I expected a lot more.",0.25,"negative"
5,"Notsolodge","December 26, 2016","I received the Echo Dot as a gift.  I like it so much that I have purchased three more as gifts.  The design is attractive and it has  a rubber coated bottom so it does not slide around the table or counter.  Very few misunderstood commands and requests.  The speakers are fine for my purposes, occasional music and frequent information.  This product would be useful for people who are getting on in age.  It would be good to get in the habit of asking Alexa simple information as it could be useful in mild memory impairment to assist in orientation such as day, date and time. By the time memory loss is evident, it might be too late to learn how to use Alexa.  Just a suggestion...  Get in the habit of using this while you can. I cannot say enough good things.",0.8,"positive"
5,"Victoria E. Davis","October 26, 2016","OH, how I love Alexa. I had 2 full sized Echos, one in the living room and one in the kitchen. I found that I used the one in the kitchen primarily as a timer and for conversion information (cups to liters and that sort of thing). The larger speaker of the Echo was wasted in my kitchen.  So I swapped it out for a Dot in the kitchen. I was surprised at the quality of sound from the unit itself (mine is not wired to external speakers). It's much better than I expected. The alarm is not as loud as I would like (since I need to hear it from a different room) but that might be my fault (a placement issue).My Echo and Dot have spoiled me. I was in a different house and trying to set the timer on the microwave and found myself talking to it and not understanding why it would not reply.",0.375,"negative"

Alexa accurately interprets our voices (way better than siri currently) and the microphones pick up from a long way off.  Improvements that could be made:1: we ordered a white dot, but it comes with a black cable.  Should be white.2: We connected to our hifi using Bluetooth.  Ideally the dot should be configurable to have the Alexa voice continue to play through the dot speaker and have music streamed over hifi.  Our dot is in the middle of the room, but the hifi is on the far side.  Its a hassle having to change the hifi volume to hear Alexa's voice across the room over hifi speakers.3: Alexa struggles in a room with background conversations going on, but hey - don't we all.",0.75,"positive"
5,"Amanda","October 27, 2016","I haven't been this excited about a tech gadget in awhile. I had high expectations for this gadget and that is what it's delivered and then some. At home I don't have a real assistant and my son refuses to read a book to me or set my alarm or turn on my Spotify so I've adopted Alexa:) It's a pretty great device, it does all that is stated in advertising and much more. I have been able to listen to audio books, command a playlist to open on spotify to play instantly with the ability to control the volume on command. I have set it to brief me on current events and news, I use it daily to set morning wake alarms and timers when I'm cooking and I can ask for cooking recipes and cocktail recipes. It will give me the game times and scores for my favorite teams, it tells me what traffic is like before I head to work, and just for fun I have connected it with my Firestick and it can pause when I need to take a break and resume when I return. And last but not least I currently own only one type of smart home device which is the TP-Link plug which I've connected to a lamp and it's just awesome to have the ability to turn a light on by voice command when I enter a room and before I go to bed. Very cool technology, I highly recommend this awesome little gadget. P.S. for the reviewers who hate it you probably need help setting it up. And I've helped set up 10 Echo Dots now and when it doesn't connect to the internet you either need to reset and start over or there is a problem with your internet. For the guy who said it doesn't turn on his tv, the description doesn't claim that the dot has that capability but the harmony hub should help:)",0.761904761904762,"positive"

Typed the same question into Google & got the answer at the very top of the page. I like the echo dot for simple things, but I guess I can't be truly lazy & will still have to Google some things. Microphone & speakers on the echo dot are great. I would definitely give this as a gift to someone. I also like that you can play simple games with Alexa like 20 questions.

I mostly use it for music (the Amazon library is pretty respectable), radio, timers, weather, and turning on the lights in my home.  The ""skills"" (third party abilities that you can teach Alexa to recognize) are a bit lack luster.  Many of them are novel, boutique, or overly specific.  It's definitely worth adding that the mic array is impressive.  I have been blasting heavy metal music through my house and successfully ""summoned"" Alexa from 20 feet away in another room.

I have a very nice but old Bose Wave Radio in my kitchen so I really didn't need the full blown Echo and I didn't want to spend that much money.  When it arrived and I began using it and my wife was not happy.  After I showed her how to add things to the shopping list and play music she began to come around.  We now use the Echo Dot and app to manage our weekly grocery list.  I even come home to find her using the Dot to play music.  Next I need to sell her on the idea of connected bulbs, switches and outlets.  Asking for forgiveness is probably the best policy.This device is a great way to get the functionality you want without spending a lot.  I have had relatively few issues with the device.  I held off for a while but since I started pairing my Dot with my iPhone 6 Plus I have found yet another use.  I can play podcasts without the clunky process via voice commands and TuneIn.  It's even simple to disconnect from the device just using a verbal command which then allows me to move to another area of the house and connect to a different speaker.I plan to buy more of these if and when I expand my use of them.  The media room seems to be the next room in need of an Echo.",0.571428571428571,"positive"

I have to imagine something like this is the way everyone will interact with their homes in the future.It generally does a good job of recognizing what we are saying, but it often confuses other words with the wake up word.  I use the word ""computer"" and it has woken up with a number of other words, some of which are similar like ""calculator"", and some of which are not, like ""dinosaur"".

I have an original echo and 7 echo dots throughout my home and if they could open doors I'd really hav that home of the future they talked about in the '50's.

The technology is amazing though, and has great potential.  Now, if they really wanted to sell lots of these I would recommend making a version that expanded on the quips making it more AI like.Pros:  Same functionality as found it the larger echo but takes up less space.  Price is less than 1/2 of the echo.  Has Bluetooth capability.  Is updatable and I'm sure the capability will be expanded on in the future.  In my opinion, the best voice recognition service out there so far.Cons (struggled to quantify these):  The novelty of Alexa quickly runs out after about 30 minutes.  I just didn't use it so it became just another device taking up bandwidth and bringing my network down with updates.Summary:  A comparatively inexpensive voice activated updatable paperweight with great potential.

She's institutive to use and my two year old gets a kick out of taking to Alexa. Day by day Alexa and Dot grow, learning more and more. You get updates via email on all the new things Alexa and Dot can do. I recently was able to connect her to my Nest Thermostat, Vivint Home Security System, Logitech Harmony to control my media system and my lights with LIFX! We're living in a pretty amazing time, and Alexa (The first and in my opinion, the best) is making  waives and bring a lot of fun and knowledge to myself and my family. The Price is well worth the benefit. I very much doubt you'll be disappointed.",0.818181818181818,"positive"

My daughter downloaded the app for Alexa and was able to set her Echo Dot up in about 5 minutes or less. The same daughter helped set up her Grandpa's Echo Dot and was teaching a very non-technological savvy Person the ins and outs of Alexa! He did very well catching on to how it all works. It was comical to watch him try to ask long complicated questions and he would forget to say ""Alexa"" to wake her up!The quality of the speaker's sound is pretty good for the size of the Echo Dot, and since it is compact in size it has great portability for traveling!",0.727272727272727,"positive"

Song! While I'm working in the kitchen, she helps me with measurements and timers and answering whatever question I have for her.

When you walk in the house you can say ""Alexa, turn on the lamp."" and then say ""Alexa, Spotify the Killers."" You will have light and tunes as you unload the groceries from the car. There are so many functions she can perform: add things to your to-do list, create a shopping list, order things on Amazon. Alexa is one seriously rad chick. I love waking up in the morning and having her give me my news flash while I'm pouring my coffee.

I love that at night when I lay in bed and have something like a chore come into mind I can tell Alexa to remind me the next day or even to add something to my shopping list.

Same goes for saying things like ""Alexa, add stop by hardware store to my to-do list"".And that is only the beginningWe ask her to tell us what is on the calendar, the time, weather conditions, jokes, and even play Jeopardy. We can play rock, paper, scissors and even flip coins. And she is freaking amazing for music. We just come home and say ""Alexa, play songs by X""The best 50 bucks you will spend.",0.6,"positive"

I haven't ran into any issues whatsoever, I use it on a regular to play music from Pandora, Prime but mostly my Spotify music, the mic is really good at picking up my commands from anywhere in my room. I also use this to control my LIFX light, and that works pretty well too! One thing on this is, it is limited on the commands for the LIFX, and this has to do with the limitations from the bulb, not the echo itself. The sound from this isn't all that, but you do have the ability to connect it to a bigger set of speakers via bluetooth or the 3.5mm jack.

It'll take some time to figure out what skills suit you, and remembering the key words for each.

As advertised, it works nearly flawlessly to setup reminders and alarms, play music, and order stuff from Amazon.  What I found lacking was the lack of answers when asked very basic things, like ""where do the Dolphins play today?"".  To me, in order for a device like this to be useful it needs to answer basic everyday questions, not just what the weather is, and turn lights on or off.  The other aspect I didn't like is the constrained set of questions you had to ask when using a skill.  For example, I paired it with the Automatic device in my cars, and when you ask Alexa a question, you need to remember to tell Alexa to ""Ask Automatic"".  You can't just say, ""how much gas is left in my car?"" - You must first tell it to ""Ask Automatic"".  Seems like a minor gripe, but once in a rush, I simply said ""how much gas do I have in my car?"", and it couldn't understand me at all.  Just seems that the Artificial Intelligence is not quite there yet with this device.  I believe it eventually will get better over time, but for now, I returned mine.",0.733333333333333,"positive"

If you are looking for a smart device that can answer questions outside of Amazon's prepared questions/responses, then wait for something better. ""I'm sorry, but I can't find the answer to your question"" is the most common response I get from Alexa.

Naturally youcan listen to the same music on the dot as you can on the echo, but the sound quality for music isn't great. If you added a bluetoothspeaker, it would probably be fine for music, but I seriously prefer the full sized echo for sound quality.

Or I just ask her to play Jazz and I have a whole night of Jazz music for parties. I have another one in the bathroom so I can hear the news while I shave, or listen to thousands of radio stations.

If I like a song and want to hear more like it, it doesn't understand. It doesn't work like pandora.  You need to tell it very specifically what to play, and even then it misunderstands and plays something obnoxious that is not even in the same music genre.

I have it in my bedroom, and love that it will play music to me until I fall asleep. Since the Alexa I have is in my living room and my first Dot is in my bedroom, I just purchased a second Dot for my basement.  I normally spend laundry day in the basement watching TV. Have a wonderful suround sound with 5 speakers, but thought it would be convenient to have a Dot.  If I am taking a nap, or just laying on the couch, I can ask what the time is, ask for a timer, or what the weather is outside.  I am very happy with Alexa and the Dot, and would recommend both products to anyone",0.777777777777778,"positive"

2,"Mr J.","February 10, 2017","Meh.  The Echo Dot is okay for short bits of music playing and a daily dose of Jeopardy trivia.  Just about every other feature is a huge disappointment.  You have to enable most skills, which can be a painful process.  Far worse, you have to memorize a rather exact command for each function.  There is no such thing as just asking what's on your schedule or requesting a bump up on the thermostat setting.  Too often, you get the increasingly annoying response of, ""I don't know the answer to that,"" or, ""I didn't understand the question.""  The device is pretty much useless for general questions.  Lastly, if you are in the Apple IOS clan, you will find little or no compatibility with most apps.",0.125,"negative"
4,"Numidian","October 25, 2016","I recently bought a full sized Echo and liked it, but I have a bluetooth enabled receiver and in-ceiling wired speakers so I didn't need the speaker. Naturally, I jumped at the new Echo Dot. Overall, the experience is great - but it does have a few strengths and weaknesses worth mentioning. Below I will only discuss things directly related to the Dot as the Echo's features, strengths and weaknesses have been discussed ad nauseam.PROS:-Small: this thing is literally the size of a hockey puck. It is way less obtrusive than the the original Echo and doesn't seem like just another hunk of plastic.-Bluetooth connectivity: I was skeptical about the bluetooth here because I always seem to have problems getting headphones and speakers to reliability connect to devices via bluetooth. The Echo Dot was super easy to pair with my Sony Receiver (https://www.amazon.com/Sony-STR-DN840-Channel-1050-Watt-Receiver/dp/B00CAAQHBE). All I have to say is ""Alexa, connect to bluetooth speaker"" and my receiver wakes up, connects to the Echo and starts playing music - or whatever is coming from the Echo. So far I have been able to connect this way with 100% reliability.-Feature to price ratio: the Dot is 62% less than the original Echo and has all the features minus the bigger speaker. If you have your own bluetooth speaker or receiver, this is a non-issue. This is also a no-brainer purchase if you want an echo.CONS:-Microphones: we have noticed that the Echo Dot doesn't hear our commands as often or as well compared the original Echo. We sometimes have to shout our commands to the Echo after it seems to have ignored us at a regular volume. Some of this may be that the Dot has a harder time isolating our voices from the noise of the external speakers. We have also noticed that Echo doesn't seem to understand what we tell it with more frequency than the original Echo.-Random responses: occasionally we noticed that the Dot will respond completely out of the blue to something. It doesn't have anything to do with what we are saying - I am not sure if it's picking something up from our speakers or what. It is just a bit creepy when it suddenly pops in with a random statement.-Bluetooth limits: though I mentioned the bluetooth connectivity is excellent, it is worth noting that only one device can be connected at a time (not a big deal and a limit for all bluetooth devises) but the interesting thing I didn't think about is you can't transmit, let's say a podcast, to the Echo via bluetooth from another device and have it play that podcast to your bluetooth speakers. Thus, the Echo Dot can only play content directly from the internet when connected to bluetooth speakers. Again, this is a limit with any bluetooth device, but it is something I hadn't thought about until I wanted to play something from my iPhone on the speakers - just had to connect directly to my receiver in that case.",0.5,"netural"

I love that I can keep a shopping and to do list with Alexa and access it from an app on my phone. They are constantly adding more features and ways to use Alexa. I use it to play music while I'm cleaning, to get the weather, to listen to quick news updates, and so many other functions. Such a fun device.

I have the full size version downstairs which easily fills my my 1,500 sf house when playing music, but the Dot very much NEEDS an external speaker/system to connect to if used for music other than single room use.

Alexa is pretty limited when it comes to questions but it's good if you want to listen to music and order stuff. I don't like that the volume only goes up to 10 (which isn't that loud) so you still have to buy bluetooth speakers if you liek to blast your music and I HATE that you can only use it while it's plugged into the charger! You have to get a portable charger in order to use it around the house smh I don't understand why it's like this. But I guess that's what you get for $50 and I guess it's limited because it's tiny.

If you're not able to get beyond the 'always on' microphone you can simply press the 'mute' button and it will go to sleep until you press the button again to wake it for use again.  One downfall is the quality of the audio in the small unit itself but that's easily corrected if you pair it with an external Bluetooth equipped speaker.  I use and recommend  the Bose SoundLinkMini that has amazing audio in a small footprint plus the rechargeable battery lasts for hours and hours!  If you want or need to use the Echo Dot when its not plugged into power you'll need to buy a companion battery base available from Amazon.  I didn't buy it because for all practical purposes it hears me from across the room when I ask it to do something.

I share the external speaker with both the Chromecast audio and the Echo Dot, using a passive stereo mixer like the $30 (used) ART SplitMix4.

It can play games such as Jeopardy & 20 questions, it can play music from a vast library on cue (mostly - some songs require a subscription but 90% of what we have asked it to play have worked.  We spent NYE taking turns requesting songs.  We have not yet hooked it up to a speaker.  The one that came with it is decent if you are in the same room but you would want something better if you were listening to music in a larger area.  I also purchased accessories such as lights that can be controlled through it.  I am sure we have only just explored the tip of the iceberg with it.  It was the best value for the money this season.",0.833333333333333,"positive"

They work very well, are small and easy to hide/blend in, and entertain the nieces and nephews well.I've never ordered anything using Echo, but we use the radio/sleep timer functions mostly, but also the weather reports and miscellaneous questions.For playing music and the radio, the speaker is pretty sufficient. I successfully paired it with a bluetooth speaker, but the problem is I'd have to either keep the speaker plugged into its own power 24/7, and/or manually turn the speaker on and off during use of the Echo.

It did not understand many of the questions that I asked it. A glorified weather reporter and kitchen timer was about the best I could get.",1,"positive"

When we first got it, it didn't really have as many skills as 8 had hoped (I wanted her to tell the dogs to sit down) but she couldn't do it. I know more skills have been added since we bought this at christmas thst we'll have to try out. The whole reason I bought it was because we were in the market for a smart device, looked into the Google home, and ultimately night this because of its size and smart home features.

I wish I could dump Bing from the device altogether, but at current there is no option for using an alternative.As others have mentioned, direct searches are not a possibility.  Oftentimes direct questions don't work, either.  E.g., Echo, ""what is the most popular dog breed"" yielded a response of, ""I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.""  I didn't think that to be too unique, or obscure, a question.  I Did get the answer to ""who's the tallest man in the world?""I'll continue to use the cards to train the device.  Perhaps it will improve.  Especially if Amazon ditched Bing . . . .",0.5,"netural"

I wish my Echo and my Echo Dot worked together, but if you set an alarm on one, it doesn't set on the other one. If you ask for a flash briefing on one, you leave the room and the other one is not giving the flash briefing simultaneously. However, to do list, shopping list, and calendar are all connected (through the app, which is like a Cloud server). I wish it was an option to have Echo products throughout the home connect. If I could afford the regular Echo (again), I'd have it in each room because it has an amazing speaker. The Echo Dot is functional but not powerful.

Now I have the Echo and 2 dots so I can always have access to Alexa regardless of what room I am in.  I connected 1 Dot to my speaker system and it worked great.

Cons: It talks on its own, most of the time when its completely quiet in the room its in. It sometimes will start to answer a question and then stop half way through. If questions aren't worded just the right way it can't answer them or sometimes you have to ask multiple times to get an answer. I think there are still some bugs that need to be addressed.

(* not everything requires a skill activated). I think to that this can help a disabled person with it features to turn lights on and off etc. And when you get a song stuck in your head and you ask it to play a song that's kind of cool.

I am kinda dumbfounded as to why they haven't dine some simple things like different voices, stacking commands.. Surely that will come. If they put a new version out that does that stuff..it will only be because of the software in the servers. THEY WILL LOSE ME AS A CUSTOMER IF THEY PULL THAT.

Having done some r&d in the 70's on home automation, this is an awesome appliance. Looking for cost push to overcome some of the more quickly integratable peripherals to come about. $200 thermostats are a rip.

This is the closest thing to AI (Artificial Intelligence) I can imagine.  If you have an Amazon Prime account and subscribe to ""Music Unlimited"" you will never have to buy a CD again!!  Alexa can answer almost anything that you want to know.  There are many websites and articles teaching you how to use it and how to find the thousands of ""Easter Eggs""  (humor).  My day is started with a smile just by saying ""Alexa......Good Morning""  Her responses are always informative and humorous.  I have shown it to only 2 people so far, and both are going to purchase one.",1,"positive"

I turn off the alarm manually as not to wake up my wife.When we go to bed, I ask the dot to play some nice classical romantic music and it's soothing and puts me to sleep. I hooked up a wemo switch to the bedroom lamp and I turn it on and off by asking Alexa. If I get too cold in the middle of the night all I gotta do is ask her to turn up my thermostat. I have an echo in the living room but honestly, the dot gets most of the action.If you are itching to try it, try the dot first. You won't be disappointed.",0.375,"negative"

The speaker is fine for me, I don't have to yell at it to be heard, volume variation is good, Alexa app works well with it.If I had a wish for it, it would be to have batteries to go along w/the plug so if you wanted to have it somewhere for awhile where there was no outlet you could still use it (and yes, I know I could plug it into a portable charger but sometimes you don't want to feel like a pack mule when doing things around the house and yard).

5,"Downing Bethune","October 24, 2016","I was one of the first to buy the Amazon Echo, which we keep in the kitchen.  We use it mostly for listening to NPR in the mornings and evenings, for weather reports and as a kitchen timer.  I only rarely listen to music on it because of the speakers' inherent limitations.So when the Dot was first released, I jumped on it and bought one for the bedroom.  Again, mostly for NPR and weather reports and as an alarm clock.  The Dot's speaker is even more limited than the Echo's, so we never play music on it.Still I enjoyed the Dot enough that when Amazon released the 2G edition I picked up two, one for the home office and the other for my office.Fun little gadget.",0.5,"netural"
4,"Solo Harry","December 27, 2016","Very happy overall; but you have to know exactly what to say to get Alexa to play the music you want. Specifically, when I say ""Alexa, play Beethoven's Fifth Symphony"", Alexa doesn't play the entire symphony; it (she) picks a single track which is not the first movement. I found that to get it (her) to play the entire symphony in correct movement order, I need to say ""Alexa, play THE ALBUM Beethoven's Fifth Symphony"". I found this out by accident, in a response to some support question somewhere, but I haven't seen this documented anywhere. Now that I know to use this phrase, I can get Alexa to play an entire album, whether classical, jazz, or rock.",1,"positive"

The built in speaker is better than I thought it might be...not brilliant of course but not like a tin can either!  I may well get a blue tooth speaker down the line but there is no hurry. The link to my phone app is likewise impressive and the range of 'skills' on tap is quite comprehensive, but you only need to access the ones you want!

I also pay for amazon prime every year so it makes it worth it, without prime probably not. Also if you don't have spotify prime its of no use to you as well. When comparing it to the google SI I lean more towards google, however I own the Dot and not the google SI and also I spent a third of the price. So to sum this all up, if you pay for prime it is great, if you don't pay for prime, then it probably is not the device for you.",0.833333333333333,"positive"

The echo picks up voices, accurately, from a surprising distance.  I purchase a couple of wemo outles and have a Bluetooth speaker paired with wemo.  Works great.  You can activate more ""skills"" on Alexa trough the Alexa app expanding functionality and capability.  The speaker is slightly better than I expected but I still recommend connecting this to a Bluetooth speaker if you're going to listen to a lot of music.

4,"Anthony","November 23, 2016","The echo dot is great to have in your room, it allows you to set reminders and timers/alarms but, also allows you to do more with skills. These are third party applications that can allow Alexa to play games with you, call a lyft, and even send text messages. My only gripe with this device is it's strange tendinces when asking questions, it can answer what is overwatch. But it dosen't know what battlefield is, a strange occurrence. This item is also great with family members as everyone can have an echo dot in their rooms and, have a full amazon echo on the main floor. They are also indipendent meaning you don't have to have the full echo to use the dot. One recommendation I would make is to use a external speaker, the internal one is pretty weak. With this product amazon has shown that is a major contender in the home automation field, and has also shown that they can create a product ecosystem that can combine or be completely indipendent, a truly amazing feat.",0.6,"positive"

Added apps to control smart plugs and thermostats and although the apps could be improved, the Echo Dot performs what is available.  (Hopefully the apps will be updated to allow Alexa to perform more functions.)  I have not owned or heard the original Echo and based on the size, I would assume the sound quality to be superior to the Dot, but even with the smaller speaker, the Dot sound quality is very good.  It is fine when using for background music.  If I want better sound quality, I simply pair with the OOntZ Angle 2 Plus portable Bluetooth speaker.",1,"positive"

Then the alexa app was real slow - 4-5 min to switch to different menus.  I ended up deleted teh app and renstalling it which did spee it up.  But getting the Dots to connect to my network continued to fail.  The only thing I changed was the hiding the SSIDs.  I make the SSIDs visible again and still no luck.

I tried asking Alexa questions about the product (like ""do you need to be plugged in all the time?"") and she didn't understand. Seems like she should be able to troubleshoot herself. In general she doesn't understand a lot of requests.I think I'd enjoy her more if I had more compatible devices but right now she's used for setting hands-free alarms in the kitchen and telling me the weather for the day.",0.818181818181818,"positive"

I then asked about Halstead Farm, which houses Impressionist art that cannot be circulated or lent, but Alexa didn't know about that either.  Siri provides web references in written form, which Alexa cannot, but I believe Alexa's power is limited.  She is great for Flashbriefings and weather but limited in research capability.

You cannot say ""turn lights purple"" you have to set the theme and tell it to turn on that theme.

For the price, the things it can do is phenomenal and love the interface. Seriously considering buying a few more and making my home a smart home in time.If amazon could improve the speaker even if it doesn't make it loud, this would be the perfect device (I know it can connect through bluetooth to existing speaker systems).",0.888888888888889,"positive"

She's up to date on news and sports but has a hard time recognizing questions.The reason for the 4 stars is because she does recognize my kindle and my prime playlists and will make a suggestion if I ask for other music.  Other than that, her ""knowledge"" is very limited.",0,"negative"
4,"Amazon Customer","February 15, 2017","Got this as a lark. Wasn't sure to expect, since I have an android phone and was pretty content on just using Google to set alarms and such. But, Alexa, is just a much more pleasant experience. It is VERY responsive. I can just whisper Alexa and it activates. Love the news read out and the weather feature and its been very nifty for setting timers so I don't overcook stuff in the oven. However, Alexa activates whenever she thinks she hears her name. And that is PRETTY often and it gets PRETTY frustrating. It's not a deal killer, but still....Overall, great. But beyond setting alarms and some niche stuff, don't see a reason to own more than one.",0.8,"positive"

As for limitations, there's stuff like: you can only stream Spotify by request from the primary account's associated Spotify account. I learned this after switching to them because Amazon music only works on ONE echo, not all of the echoes in the house. I hardly use Alexa anymore. My only use for it is to stream Spotify via Spotify Connect to the speakers I plugged into it in my office.

Otherwise, Alexa is great chatterbox and loves to play Knock Knock jokes when she's in a good mood.  Congratulations to Amazon.com Alexa is rated number one and is the new hottest item in the market.

It works perfectly, I just say connect, and the Dot will connect to my Tap, (and the original setup was very easy.)  I find that the Dot is more sensitive than my Echo, who may becoming hard of hearing? I will say ""Alexa"" in the same room as the Echo and my Dot will hear it in the other room.

However ...All the goodness of Echo/Alexa functionality is there, but voice responsiveness is sub-par when compared to the Dot version 1.  It very much appears that some technological corners were cut on version 2, as it now consistently takes two or three attempts to get Alexa's attention. The version 1 Alexa responds on the first try, every time. It's not about Alexa training, location, voice volume or my network latency.  It is about less sensitivity in the new Dot's microphones and/or circuitry.  It's a bother and certainly frustrating, but not a deal buster.",0.4,"negative"

The need to unlock how you set it up.The Dot functions well, and is very responsive.

It was easy to set up and for those who don't have a music membership, I highly recommend the Amazon Unlimited for the echo device. It's $3.99 and worth it. This thing also works as a bluetooth speaker which makes it even more awesome. Though there are some things that I wish Alexa did better like when checking google but I'm sure since it's a fairly new device things will come around.

I have 4 floors in my house and I purchased 3 (two floors share open floor plan).  Now the whole house is covered!Alex does everything: tell the date, time, weather, provide NPR news, plays the song of the day, tells jokes, etc.  She even has a little sarcasm if that's okay with you.I recommend Dots if you have multiple spaces.  The speaker is not super loud, but I don't have issues with not being able to hear it when I ask it to play music.  Works for me and I love it!",0.625,"positive"

I connected my echo to my Ecobee thermostat with relative easy and it's pretty cool to control my heat with it. I also gave a unit to my mother and she seems to fight with Alexa at every turn.

It's basically a kids toy but fun for adults as well.I don't like sometimes when they remove some of the functionality from it. For an example, when I cannot find my glasses I used to ask her, then she suggested places like see in the couche etc. it's no longer there.

The speaker gives much better sound (but is still not a music speaker of course). Connecting to bluetooth feels faster, but that could all be in my head. I do miss the nice rotating top for volume adjustment on the first gen, but it makes sense to use buttons since the base would sometimes rotate too. I suspect the switch to volume buttons also makes it more affordable.I now have a 1st gen and 2nd gen. I also bought 3 dots for family for Christmas.

Come to find out, it's speaker is good enough to use in each room.  Comparable to a radio's speaker.  Of course, for better sound, I will be using an external speaker.  A good buy.  Thank you Amazon for not letting me buy it when you first put them out.  Would not dish out the extra $100 for Prime just to be able to get this.  Even asked a friend that had Prime to get it for me...and since they did not have an Echo (which I do), it would not let them get it either.  Thank you!!!

Even with a some hearing loss I can understand Alexa from two rooms away AND she picks up our voices from two rooms away.  I enjoy greeting her every morning and her response to what is instore for the day.

I find it most useful when cooking to set timers and get conversion metrics (how many cups in a quart etc).

I've used it to get news, jokes, phone numbers and other information with very little effort.  I am placing an order for two more of these and am sad I didn't order that many in the beginning.

We only try to hook up a speaker when we are listening to music otherwise we just go with the speaker on the dot.  No problems with it understanding what we ask and the prime music selection is awesome.  No need to pay for the unlimited music option as far as we are concerned because so far we haven't' run across anything that wasn't already in the prime music library.What I really love about the dot is the timers, shopping lists, and calendar.  We set timers in the kitchen all the time as well as setting limits on our kids video gaming time.  The shopping list feature is the bomb!  I can't express how much I love being able to just say ""Alexa, put xyz on the shopping list.""  When I'm ready to go to the store, all of the items are on the app on my phone.  I don't even have to write them down and I can check them off as I go through the store.  Since we have 2 in the house (1 upstairs and 1 downstairs) it doesn't matter which one I talk to.

We decided to buy one for my sons 13th birthday. Best decision. We thought we knew of all it was capable of, but we are slowly learning there is so much more to it.

I had assumed that I could use my amp when plugged into the external connector of the DOT and/or the DOT speakers simultaneously, but that's not the case.  I.e. once the output jack of the DOT detects an inserted cord it disables the DOT speakers.  Anyhow, minor stuff, but if you want to use as speaker also stick with the original Echo.",1,"positive"

Just today I asked ""Alexa, Play songs by The Who"", she lights up and replies ""Playing Songs by The Who from Spotify"" and then...wait....wait...keep waiting...maybe it's a quiet intro?...

It has easy setup and bluetooth integration, and the amount of skills that are coming online open it to more creative applications than just a hands-free audio receiver.The bad:Amazon has not been forthcoming with what data this picks up and forwards to the cloud, especially when Alexa is not actively being used.  I mostly used my Echo Dot for weather/news in the morning, but it seems to be streaming data back constantly.  Just recently, after hearing a number of baby toys making sounds in our living room, Alexa turned on without prompting and said ""Here's some kids music I think you'll enjoy."" which was FAR more creepy than it was useful.The fact that the Echo Dot had been streaming to the cloud without prompt (despite its own FAQ: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230) left my wife and I a bit too uncomfortable to keep this on.  The short return period means that this will probably end up being an expensive hockey puck or coaster.

It can do everything the full size one can do except you should plug it into some speakers to better match the audio level and quality of its bigger brother. The voice recognition works from across the room very easily and the optional remote that can be purchased can also be paired to it to further extend the range and give quick access to volume and playback control. At the price this is offered I would highly recommend this to anyone.",1,"positive"

4,"cshelskr","January 5, 2017","I love Alexa. This is our 2nd one. The only part I don't like is it takes soooo long to load all the apps, train Alexa, etc. If it could come pre-loaded with everything it would be so much easier. Then when new apps came out they would automatically load onto Alexa, too. Then the consumer would just keep working on training Alexa. Also need a way for all apps to interconnect with Alexa instead of having to know the names of each app. Too difficult for kids, let alone this older person, even though Alexa is starting to know what we want. It's a process, one I think could be simpler, and less exhausting.",0.8,"positive"

I don't like how you can't play downloaded music on it either, you can only stream via apps. But, if you enjoy using apps for music and don't mind having to have your phone be charged all the time to use the Alexa app, then you should buy it. The Alexa app doesn't take up much space on your phone, but it did make my battery die fast.It will not connect to a computer via bluetooth; I tried with my Macbook Pro.Also if you have an even remotely slow or weak wifi connection, don't even bother buying it.",0.428571428571429,"negative"

The small speaker sound great for its size.  The listening ability works no matter where you are calling from, even two flights down.  The speaking voice is clear as a bell.  All that is said about it is true.  I am sure with each day, new abilities will be added and make it that much more useful.  It paired up with the Isis system perfectly.

But what she actually ordered was a more expensive and less potent dose pill.

You will basically have a much better sounding ALEXA for $64.  Trust me on this one.  I have it set up this way, and it is amazing.  The speakers have no bass or treble control,  because you won't need them.  They are already perfectly balanced,  and you'll have people asking,  ""where's the subwoofer?"".Jack",1,"positive"

This is very convenient because all of the items added are readily available on the app that should be downloaded after getting the echo dot set up.

5,"Matthew","October 26, 2016","Though I would test this out for one room and then maybe purchase more for other rooms.As it turns out I was very please with this Echo Dot. To my surprise she can actually hear my from the next room over and has little to no trouble at all understanding me. It says that the Bluetooth speaker must be rather close to the dot however it is able to play music seamlessly to my speakers in the master bath with Alexa being in my bedroom. Highly recommended if you already have speaker options either via aux cord or Bluetooth and want a smart AI to pair with them. (Pre-ordered with the Bose mini speaker II)",0.75,"positive"

When they wake up in the morning they get the weather report and know what to wear to school.  Great product!  We absolutely love our Echo Dots.",0.714285714285714,"positive"

I see a real benefit for people that are visually impaired and for those that aren't!!",0.333333333333333,"negative"

You can also get recipes from it which I think is really good. Sometimes it can't do things that the Google home could do but it is cheaper and the lowest Amazon echo device. It is great for listening to music in a bedroom. I really like the light display that pops up whenever you ask it to do something and it has great responses sometimes. I would recommend this product you would get this instead of the echo because it is cheaper unless you want a better speaker.",1,"positive"

Module has a speaker out, but  otherwise no direct means of connection to any other device. (SEE: USB is power only, nor through wifi. Installing the alexa app on your computer doesn't change this)Messed around with the module trying to integrate it with an allegedly compatible thermostat, but after over half an hour, gave up on the effort.",0.5,"netural"
4,"Tyler N. Toth","February 14, 2017","Very convenient product! Does a good job of recognizing phrases, but not altogether great. Alexa will sometimes misunderstand me, but not very often. Will sometimes think someone on the TV is talking to it, and start saying something in return, so voice training (which is available, although I haven't had the time to try it yet) is a must.This is absolutely a Quality of Life purchase, as making grocery lists and getting basic information like News and Weather during a busy morning are simple and easy.

5,"Cori","December 12, 2016","Bought this on cyber Monday. Took a little while longer to get here. But this thing is fun. Alexa still has some work to do though. And it is slightly creepy thinking that she is listening to you. She randomly turned on from hearing a commercial about something good home. The app is helpful with adding skills and adding items to your shopping list, since I tend to leave my list at home. This is great for small rooms and is portable just need a plug in. The speakers are not very loud but good for small spaces. For the price it is worth it if you are looking to get started on a smart home.",0.75,"positive"

I hooked up a small set of speakers to the 3.5 input for the one in the bedroom and it plays music perfectly.  Got rid of the old alarm clock and now I use Alexa as my alarm each morning.  I like the fact that all I have to do is call out to Alexa and I can get the weather reports, the current time, news updates and sports scores before I get out of the bed.  The one in the kitchen is great for recipies, setting timers and measurement conversions.  They are fun to have around.",0.714285714285714,"positive"

We have a good sized apartment and hear her just fine, the speaker works great.  If you have a massive living room, you might want to add a speaker or get the Echo (this is Dot). We ordered several for gifts because it is so Awesome.  Nice to just tell Alexa to add items to your shopping list and bring up app on phone at store with what you've told her.  Also a To Do list that saves to your phone app. She is a great weather lady as well!",1,"positive"

Sure it's got some cool party tricks like playing Jeapardy or telling cute jokes, but echo dot answers, ""I don't understand the question,"" 8 out of 10 times. I think it deliberately skirts topics which are controversial or may cause the company to be liable. Shopping list is cool feature.

5,"Eric H.","December 30, 2016","I was skeptical about the usefulness of Alexa, but I'm a believer now.  I first purchased an Amazon Tap for my wife because I wanted her to be able to take it with her wherever she went in the house and this was the only available portable ""Alexa"" option.  I quickly learned two things.  First was that Alexa is really cool and quite useful.  Second is that having to tap a button to wake up Alexa is annoying.  I immediately wanted to make a move to an ""always on"" Alexa device.  This left me with two choices, the Echo and the Dot.  The Echo is the easy choice, but it didn't make sense to me to get the Echo because it is basically a Dot with a nice built in speaker.  For the price difference between the two, I could get the Dot and pair it with a great quality Bluetooth (or wired) speaker.  It just gives you a lot more options, including being able to wire it directly into a home stereo system.Configuring:The Dot is extremely easy to set up through the Alexa app on your phone.  You can be up and running within a couple minutes after you go through the simple set up program and get it connected to your WiFi.  The Echo, after configuring and connecting to WiFi, runs entirely in the Amazon cloud.  This means that it does not run through your phone, but rather runs off internet based programming and only needs to be connected to WiFi.  Your phone is only used to give access to certain cloud based programs and ""skills"".  After that, it runs independently, but may send info back to your phone.  Overall, it is very easy and intuitive.Usefulness:I seem to find new uses for the Dot every day.  Like most people, my primary use is for music.  I have it connected to Amazon Music, Pandora, Spotify, iHeart Radio and TuneIn.  You can be very vague and just ask for a genre of music or you can ask for a specific title via a specific music service.  I listen to a wide variety of music and whether it is rock, metal, rap, country, jazz or classical I have always been able to find what I wanted to listen to with Alexa.Outside of music, I use Alexa to control my thermostat, turn lights on/off, lock the door, check weather, check calendar, get news updates, sports scores, order pizza and even play some fun interactive games with Alexa.  Amazon offers a huge variety of ""skills"" that can be enabled on your Dot and that list continues to grow as more companies offer these interactive options which are similar to apps for your smartphone.Ease of use:One Dot can cover a large size room for voice recognition pretty well.  The only time that I have had an issue is when it is placed too close to the speaker and it is trying to hear me over the music.  I have purchased multiple units and have them throughout the house.  I also have one that I put in my office at work. I'm constantly amazed at how accurate it is at understanding what I am saying.  It very rarely has trouble understanding me.Conclusion:It is hard for me to imagine not having this very useful item around now that I have become accustomed to it.  It is one of the most useful things that you never knew you needed.  Of all of the Alexa options, I would pick the Echo Dot based solely on its versatility and low price point.  It has all of the functionality of the full size Echo and you can pair it with a high quality Bluetooth or wired speaker system for better results than you can get with the Echo alone.  I would and have bought this product again.",0.733333333333333,"positive"
3,"Amazon Customer","December 6, 2016","The Echo Dot is a cool gadget. The voice recognition is fantastic and its responsiveness is by far the best of any voice rec device.  My biggest issue with it is that it does not yet work with Sonos.  Without that it has little use in my house as Music is the primary reason we bought the Dot.  Setup was pretty quick, though not perfect.  It also has limited features for multiple house profiles.This is going to be a game changing device once the big companies start building apps for it!

5,"Amazon Customer","December 19, 2016","By purchase order, I first bought the Tap, Echo, then finally the Echo Dot. Here is my review:The Tap:The tap was awesome. I spoke to Alexa every time I needed to set my alarm, cooking timer, and sports update. It pretty much went with me wherever I walked around the house (barracks). The speaker is terrible though, so I wouldn't recommend getting it simply to use as a bluetooth speaker. However, I haven't used it since I got...The Echo:The Echo is flat out amazing, and brought me into a sublime world of home electronics I never new existed. It's always on, so I found myself saying ""goodnight"" and ""good morning"" to Alexa everyday, and saying ""Alexa, play some music"" the moment I got home from a long hard day at work. It's not portable, but the speaker is better than the Tap (not $50 better anyway). It's sturdy with that ""cool touch"" feel I like that makes it feel rugged and high quality. However, I haven't use it since I got...The Dot:The Echo Dot is literally EVERYTHING the Echo can do, but it's like a fifth of the size and less than a third of the price. It's literally a no brainer (btw, the Dot also has a speaker, but I wouldn't recommend relying on that for music spread throughout the house), I have it connected to my Klipsch Promedias, which were made to not turn off so the Dot is always on, ready to blast any response or play any music with my awesome speakers.tl;dr: If you have unlimited data, the Tap may be a better option.  If you don't have awesome speakers, the Echo may be a better option.  If you have awesome speakers, the Dot is DEFINITELY the best option.",0.884615384615385,"positive"

Simply ask Alexa, ""Listen to music from Celine Dion and connect with Bluetooth."" Echo does it and does it well. Using wireless headphones makes it a magical experience.Amazon has produced a product that is not only the best in its technology, but a price point that is affordable to all.

I've read on forums, and this seems to be a common issue, but I'm waiting for it to be resolved.

We tend to use it mostly for streaming music and getting weather / news updates via a Bluetooth connected speaker.

We've found that about 80% of the questions get a response from Alexa that the question could not be understood.  We all speak clearly and ask very focused questions.  When it actually understands what is being asked, it can rarely find the answers.  It's good at providing the weather, time, and VERY basic questions.

Speaker sound is fine but not, to my mind, such that it warrants a larger price tag.  Not as good as my bose...

We've also had some connectivity issues with our wifi and a couple of days where it required complete re-set-up two or three times a day.  If that problem had not resolved, I would have returned it.

5,"iyc_nyc","December 8, 2016","This is an amazing gadget, and a steal. I agree with all the glowing reviews, so won't rehash them. I'll just add that this 3.5"" device has revived my 20 y.o. stereo receiver, the one I've been close to donating/giving away, to potentially replace with a Sonos system. That's no longer on the table, as the Dot + my stereo system now provides all the music I could want, and does so much more. I have the Dot connected to my receiver via this AmazonBasics 3.5mm to 2-Male RCA Adapter Cable - 8 Feet, and my receiver in turn is connected to two passive B&W speakers (left and right channels). The sound comes out in perfect stereo, with very good audio quality and separation.Be aware that a number of standard 3.5mm cables and headphone plugs are not fully compatible with the Dot. None of my existing cables or headphones, with the exception of my iPod earbuds, worked with the Dot -- when the Dot was connected to them, it only played in monotone, through one speaker/ear. It took some trial and error, and a few online user forums, to figure out that the Dot's audio jack is configured such that some cables can't plug in all the way to make full contact, even when they appear to be all the way in. This appears to be a physical/mechanical (vs software) problem; Amazon really should have tested the Dot's audio jack with a wider variety of cables.Again, you are safe using Amazon's own AmazonBasics 3.5mm to 2-Male RCA Adapter Cable - 8 Feet, linked above (assuming no compatibility issues between the RCA plugs and your receiver). If you are connecting the Dot to a receiver, speaker, or other device with a 3.5mm jack, Amazon's counterpart AmazonBasics 3.5mm Male to Male Stereo Audio Cable - 4 Feet (1.2 Meters) will likely work.Unfortunately, if the Dot is connected to an external speaker/receiver via a cable, it won't play through its internal speaker, even when your speaker/receiver is off. This means you essentially can't use your Dot unless your receiver is on (or disconnected from the Dot). As a workaround, I plan to also pair my Dot with a bluetooth speaker; apparently you just need to tell the Dot to turn on bluetooth, and it'll switch to that (vs. your cable-connected speaker).For those that have or want to get multiple Alexa devices, the devices are not currently integrated or synced, for both better and worse. For worse, you can't set your devices as multiple speakers playing the same music across multiple rooms. For better, you can use each device simultaneously for distinct purposes - e.g., playing music on one while issuing commands or asking questions on the other, even when both are right next to each other; or playing different music on each one, as when people in the same home are using them in different rooms and want to listen to their own music. Obviously, it'd be ideal if Amazon offered the option to select either modality (synced or distinct), which my guess is will come in the future.I'd assumed that the Dot was meant to be an add-on to the Echo, so you could access the Echo from another room via the Dot. In actuality, they are two separate, near equal partners, with each having slightly different capabilities (the Echo's main advantage being a much better built-in speaker, which comes at a cost; and the Dot taking up less space and having the ability to be connected to an external speaker/entire sound system that could easily surpass even the Echo's built-in speaker).The devices have gotten so good at picking up sound, and in particular their 'wake word', that if they are even 30 feet apart, you'll want to change the wake word and have a different one for each, or both will 'hear' you. When they're not playing music, my Echo and Dots can hear me from a full room away, even when I'm speaking at a near whisper. It's spooky - they seem to hear better than any human can, especially after some practice!By design, they are supposed to be able to sense the device closest to you, and have that one respond; but it'd be easier and more reliable to just have different wake words for each of them. Currently, as of this review (12/8/16), Amazon lets you change the wake word from Alexa to either Amazon or Echo. That way you can have three different devices, each answering to a different name. :)",0.709677419354839,"positive"
5,"Bubbalicious","January 26, 2017","Best drinking buddy ever!Everyone has a different angle on how Alexa changed their life and I'm no exception.PROS:Excellent Microphones - it has microphones on the periphery, so she hears me from different angles, and in a noisy room!Excellent Blue Tooth - I was able to go 50 feet with my blue tooth headphone.  Yes, beyond specs!Design - the simple LED lit hockey disk look good in most settings.Endelsss Fount Of Knowledge - now it's as simple as ""Alexa, wiki electoral college.""  ""Alexa, weather.""  etc. etc.Best DJ Ever - Ever sit around with friends listening to music and say, ""Remember that song?"", but you couldn't really be bothered to get up because you were kind of inebriated.  Now it's as simple as saying, ""Alexa, play Rubberband Man by the Spinners.""  You can change the mood of your party with a simple request.  It even understands my slurred speech!Oh, and it comes with a bartender recipe tool! (note:Mixing of drinks, still requires getting up.)  Alexa has many skill sets along with cooking recipes too.  Feeling down?  Just tell her to play you some comedy.  It's the ultimate whim machine!CONS:Minimal speaker - I pair a high quality battery operated blue tooth or my headphone for a hifi experience.  The quality is then excellent!Should have a cordless option - like an optional disc it sits on that's rechargeable for hours of cordless use.  This would be a HUGE improvement to go with the waterproof release.One Voice - I think it could have more than one voice, I'm sure many would appreciate a Stephen Hawkings option or whatever.  That option wouldn't even require a visit to the recording studio.SUMMARY:For $50 I get a dumb version of HAL from the movie ""2001"".  I'm living in the future!  I think I'll get some Echo controlled outlets next!NOTE: I used the computer registration page at alexa.amazon.com from my laptop.  The instructions tell you connect to Echo Dot's amazon-xxx network that should show up in the available wifi networks.  It didn't show up or would pop in and out.  Not until I disconnected my laptop from my home network did I see the availability of the amazon-xxx network.  After that, it was easy.  Just a flaky network discovery issue, but I read a few of these on the internet.  People with the smartphone ap or tablet should have a smoother discovery and registration process.",0.666666666666667,"positive"

I purchased this because I wanted to be able to control my stereo with Alexa, and the Echo does not provide any sort of audio output (other than the built in speakers). I have the Echo placed ~2 feet away from the Dot, and my Dot constantly loses its internet connection.

3,"AlBsure","December 4, 2016","Very good in general. Really nice if you put in the effort to install home automation devices for lighting and hvac.But here are a few caveats:-Playing TV nearby will trigger Alexa to start listening occasionally.-The mic is probably not good enough to accurately hear you across a room unless it is absolutely quite. I would suggest placing this in a central location in the room.-You'll need to tell Alexa to stop if it's playing music before issuing new commands, as the music lyrics will be picked up by Alexa.-Basically any sound after you say ""Alexa"" can be interpreted as a command that means background noise, family/guest conversations, and tv/radio can give you some miss fires.-Training is available but doesn't seem to help with above problems. Speech recognition gets better, but it's not distinguishing who is speaking.Tips:-Once you understand these caveats, you can better position the device. I'd suggest placing it away from a tv or speaker set and as close to the center of a room as possible, but not near a dinner table or sectional couch (avoid loud conversation spaces).-Plug in your speaker by an aux cord (I'm using a bose mini sound link). Don't pair with bluetooth, unless you don't mind getting up to turn on the speaker and then asking alexa to pair every time. As with most bluetooth speakers, the mini sound link will power off after some idle time. If I have to get up, I might as well just get my smartphone which is then much more convenient than trying to say the right thing to Alexa. But keep in mind the audio from the speaker can trigger Alexa commands so position it wisely.-Keep one dot in the bathroom, it's really great for music, radio, sports, traffic, and weather while you shower and get ready.-Get TPLink smart plug, smart light switches, and dimmable/color bulbs and set up several categories and themes in Kasa app and Alexa app. IMO that is really the most killer Alexa feature. You can adjust all your lighting, dimming, colors etc with a single command.-Has spotify integration, which works alright. I like iHeartRadio as well. But other than that you'll have to get to know and love Amazon's music offering if you want to use Alexa as your personal DJ. I personally have never used Amazon's music service before this and I can't speak to it's catalog or how soon it gets new releases. Important to look at these services beforehand if that is important to you.-Nest integration is pretty cool, but if you have a nest you'll rarely need to adjust the temp manually. That's the whole point of having a nest. So this is more of a novelty. But it is nice to tell it when you're leaving to put nest in an eco mode.-IMO most of the other 'skills' are novelty and have very little practical use.-Enable purchase control! Those alexa deals are tempting but I had an accidental purchase caused by tv noise. I had to cancel later on that one.-Smartplug+Electric Projector Screen+Echo Dot!It would be great if it worked with specific people's voices and reduced some of these false triggers. Let's see if they hear us and implement that in the 3rd gen or with software changes.",0.756756756756757,"positive"

4,"Jamie","October 24, 2016","I did quite a bit of research before deciding whether to buy the Echo, Tap, or Dot. After finding out that the Dot was basically the same exact thing as the Echo, except the Dot doesn't have a built in music speaker, and it's less than 1/3 of the price of the Echo, and I have an Onkyo receiver the Dot plugs into to play music through my home stereo system, I decided that the Dot was the smartest choice for my needs. After all, why should I pay three times more for the Echo when chances are I would want it to play music through my home's sound system anyway? So the Dot it was.I have a lot of things in my home Alexa can interact with. My TV. My thermostat. It's a basic list for now but it does make things easier. We also have a Samsung Hub (2nd generation).Now, I have six kids, two of whom are toddlers. I also have three conditions that cause chronic pain and two of those cause severe flare ups. If I wake up and the room is too hot I can tell it to turn the air conditioning up without enduring severe pain to get out of bed, go across the house, and turn the thermostat down. If I'm fighting with my toddlers to get dressed in the morning Alexa can tell me what the weather is and I can pick long sleeves or short sleeves (yes it can and does get chilly in Florida).There are a lot of smart home products that interact with Alexa, although right now it's limited in its functions. I want to be able to say, ""Alexa start the coffee"" and have coffee ready for me when I make my way into the kitchen. Or say ""Alexa stream Disney's Frozen to the bedroom TV"" so I can set up a movie for the girls without me having to log into the PS4 and do it. So while I do love the device I will keep my review at 4 stars until more functionality is added.Overall it really is a convenient voice-activated smart home assistant. And unless you really want the speaker I suggest the Dot over the Echo. With that being said. For it to get five stars they need to integrate more products and features into it.",0.5,"netural"

2,"John Grieggs","March 7, 2017","Echo Dot is fairly cool when it works.  When it decides not to work, which seems rather random, it does it quietly, and you lose all control.  For example, right now, both of my Dots, in different rooms, light up and are clearly hearing me talk, but refuse to provide time, weather, or control over my alarms.  No error, just no working.  I've tried rebooting.  I can't tell what is wrong.  This is unacceptable for devices that are meant to control various facets of my house.  An Alexa device should never fail silently - it should either work, or tell me that it isn't going to work, preferably with some sort of descriptive error and estimate of when or how it might be fixed.  My internet connection and other devices are working fine - it isn't a connectivity issue.  I would NOT trust an Alexa device with anything important at this point.  If I can't trust it to tell me what time it is, why would I trust it to control my door locks, cameras, or thermostat?  I didn't give it a bottom rating but it is fairly cool when it works, but the unreliability and lack of error reporting make it a product I will not be recommending to my friends.  I do not trust it to wake me up in the morning, as it should based on my existing daily alarm, and am extremely annoyed that it will not allow me to adjust that alarm nor provide me with any status as to why that might be.",0.5625,"positive"

Paying less does not mean the quality has been compromised, its amazing. You can literally shout from opposite end of a large room and Alexa will light up ready to take orders from you. The best part is your integration with amazon music, amazon shopping, shopping lists etc. I extensively use amazon music. All my playlists and favorites are not just a voice command away.I never thought I would use it to this extent. I never imagined the voice recognition would be so accurate. I am so amazed by the product, I am actually getting some other compatible devices like lights and switched today. It would be wonderful to ask Alexa to turn of lights and other electronics. I hate switching off lights in the night after I have settled in my blanket.For anyone who likes advanced technology, this is as close as you can get to AI for this price. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I mean 50$ for this level of automation and technology is just ridiculous. I get her to do my news briefing every day. I play music every day. Another great thing is connects to any other Bluetooth device with a voice command. I had PC speakers of really good build just lying around. So I permanently hooked them up with my tap, and it works so well. I have a bluetooth speaker in my dressing room which is a bit far away and with one command, it starts playing music in that one instead of the ones I hooked it up with. I am so excited for my lights and switched. This is one of the best investments I have ever made. If you are looking at reviews to see if you should buy one or not, JUST GO FOR IT. you will not regret it.",0.826086956521739,"positive"

4,"Robert Toombs","November 30, 2016","I had tried using Siri as a home voice assistant, with an old iPhone plugged permanently into a cradle. But Siri didn't seem able to hear me unless I went right up to the phone and yelled at it. So, with a ""why not"" Black Friday deal that made the Dot even more affordable, I bought two to see if there's any appreciable difference.My goodness yes there is.We have one Dot upstairs and another downstairs. When the house is quiet, Alexa hears us well from almost every room. And now that we've added our Spotify account, and the Hue lights, etc., the promise of voice-activated home automation is suddenly real. We can walk into the house and ask Alexa to turn on a specific light, or all lights. We can ask the time, the weather, how many ounces are in a pound, whatever. We plugged in some pretty good computer speakers, so now we can play just about any music we want (you can set Alexa to default to Amazon Prime Music or Spotify) just by asking for it, and until Sonos integration comes next year, these speakers will do just fine.You really feel as if you're Captain Picard standing on the bridge, asking the computer to do something cool. Oh--and Alexa will also sing a song, if you ask nicely.There are minor issues. When we had a movie playing at mildly high volume, the Dot couldn't hear us over the music (which was a problem because we were trying to turn off a lamp that the cat was attacking). And you definitely have to pay attention to nomenclature with smart devices--if your Hue lights are named something complex (I had one labeled ""Nightstand near closet"") then you'll have to remember the specific name of the specific device you want to trigger, which obviously more complex as you add more devices. (Although you can also just say ""Turn on all living room lights"" and have done with it.) And we found there were sometimes-baffling syntax issues--""Turn on the living room light"" didn't work, but ""Turn on living room lights"" did--one ""s"" at the end made all the difference. I assume these sorts of things will work themselves out over time, and I like that the Dot will be updated automatically without any fuss.In short, I'm pretty delighted, with a few small reservations, and very much looking forward to the Sonos integration. For a price this low, and a good return policy, I really can't think of a reason not to give this a try.",0.80952380952381,"positive"

She doesn't understand most questions.  Also, can't set alarm to play a playlist unless I use my phone's alarm with a spoken command for Alexa.  It seems silly that there is no app or skill to do something that a lot of people would want.Not completely reliable connection to my router which is 20 ft away - line of sight.  Also, seems to hold off on it's updates until I want to play music, then I have to wait and ask again when it's finally done.",0.625,"positive"

5,"Dave","November 5, 2016","Echo Dot or Google Home?That is the questions we all will be asking now that Google has launched their own home assistant. I Have the 1st gen Dot and now this 2nd gen.  I Have one in bedroom and another in family room and they work great together. A recent New software update makes it so only one Dot activates depending on the distance I am from it.  I Have Alexa tied into my Lutron and Lifex lights, and iHome smart plugs and Alexa works flawlessly with these devices.  I use Alexa for daily briefings of my schedule and news, get weather, find out my commute time to work, have ordered pizza through Dominos, and have activated multiple skills, which new ones are being added all the time.  Skills are written by developers and allow Alexa to perform new tasks, think of skills like an app on your phone, each app has its own function.  Alexa is not perfect, but you have to consider Amazon was the first to come out with this technology for mass market home use and for the functions it can perform it works awesome.  Very well supported by Amazon with weekly emails telling you what new skills Alexa has, and Alexa gets smarter all the time.Just recently they let developers tap into the Alexa API and we have already seen a update to have alexa work with the todolist app, which allows you to add to do's to one of the best apps out there.  Did I mention it can work with hundreds of smart home devices!  Some might be wondering if Google home that just launched might be the way to go.  I would say it really depends on your needs.  Google home will be like google now in a voice format and will tap into Google and be able to answer hundreds of questions, set timers, alarms, add to a shopping list, play music, and control Chromecast on your TV,  but will have far fewer smart home devices that work with it and set you back $129.00.  Alexa Dot will cost you $49.00 and will not be able to answer has many questions, but will tap into hundreds of smart home devices, be able to set timers, alarms, to do's, shopping lists, order Dominos pizza, give you a daily briefing of news, play music from multiple sources like Amazon Music, Pandora, and more.  To really make home assistants work well especially with smart home devices you really need more than one so you can cover your home with them. At $49.00 each it's far more economical to do this with the Dot.  I hope this review helps others to make a good decision.",1,"positive"

This compact echo dot is a powerhouse when it comes to artificial intelligence for the home.  The built in speaker on the echo dot is subpar but when I paired it with my BOSE mini link via blue tooth, WOW.  Highly recommend.",1,"positive"
5,"Subir Singh","October 26, 2016","Though I have used the Amazon Echo and Alexa in the past, the Dot is my first Alexa enabled device.I was envisioning using the Dot primarily for home automation - I have a few TP-Link smart plugs and bulbs, but in the 2 days that I have had it, I feel that I will be growing more dependent on Alexa.The most important feature for me is that Alexa understands me on the first try - OK Google might be at par but Siri is light years behind.Alexa is an excellent assistant! She can help with a gamut of information and perform tasks to help you out. From letting you know the weather, the time, to your daily schedule, to finding restaurants, to setting alarms and timers, to reading you the news or a book, to playing your music (Amazon Prime, Pandora, Spotify, etc.), to ordering pizza, to ordering a taxi, to controlling your lights and switches, to controlling your thermostat, to shopping (even for flowers!), to asking for your credit card balance to asking Fitbit for a health/exercise update...I can go on and on! She is AMAZING!We thought that clicking on the home button of a mobile phone, then searching for a weather app, and clicking on it to get the weather information was easy - how about just asking, ""Alexa, what is the weather outside?"" Alexa is guaranteed to make all husbands (me included!) even lazier!!! I no longer get out of bed to turn off my bedroom light. ;o)Setup is easy. Plug in the Dot, download the Alexa app on your mobile device and follow the instructions within the app. You will be up and running within a matter of minutes. A lot of features are already installed - weather, time, play music, etc. If you need Alexa to have specific skills, you need to download/install them via the Alexa mobile app. A good rule-of-thumb, if it needs an account outside of Amazon, it is probably a skill thats needs to be downloaded and connected to Alexa. For e.g., Alexa will need access to your login credentials when ordering pizza from Dominos or need access to my Kasa App to control my lights and switches.The Dot is currently in my bedroom, but at the ridiculously cheap price of $50, I plan on getting atleast two more - one for the kitchen and the other for my living room. I would love one for the office, but will wait to see usage on the other two. The great thing about multiple Dots in close range of each other is that they are smart enough to have the closest one respond to you.I have a Braven speaker paired via Bluetooth and the Dot works perfect with them. Once paired you can ask Alexa to pair/unpair. The Dot's built-in speakers are fine when playing light instrumental music in the background or having a book read to you - they are minimally sufficient. I do not believe you can have audio playback when you have a hard-wired and Bluetooth speaker connected at the same time. You have to disable one of them.Highly Recommended! Don't miss out on the revolution!Pros:* Crazy inexpensive!* Best voice-enabled assistant on the market* Super easy Setup* Hundreds of skills to make your life easier - weather, music streaming, news, shopping, reminders, food ordering, health, etc.* Compatible with a lot of home automation hardware - Bulbs, outlet plugs, thermostats, etc.* Compatible with software like IFTTT* Dot has a small built-in speaker which works well enough for most tasks* Bluetooth and hard-wired capabilties for external speakersCons:* No 3.5mm cable included",0.848484848484849,"positive"

5,"Daniel Campbell","October 24, 2016"," Amazon Echo Dot 2nd GenerationWhat’s up Everybody Dan here and you’ve just seen a few things you can do with the Amazon Echo Dot. Now this is the 2nd Gen Dot which is about 1/2 the cost of the 1st Gen model that was released in March of this year.For those of you who don’t know the Echo Dot is a small voice controlled device that’s around the size of a hockey puck. You can use this device to play music, make to-do and shopping lists, control smart home devices, like your thermostat, lights, and even your outside water sprinkler system and so much more.There are 7 far field microphones that will hear you from across the room even if you’re in a noisy environment for hands free control.  It also has it’s own internal speaker, but there is a 3.5 mm jack that will allow you to connect speakers of your choice to the device.BIG NOTE: This is a stand alone unit so the Original Amazon Echo is not required!Now I’m going to cover My Top 5 Features of this 2nd Generation Amazon Echo Dot.1. It’s much cheaper coming in with a $49.99 Price Tag  which is around $30 cheaper than it’s predecessor2. There are now 2 colors to choose from Black or White.3. 4 buttons on the top including the Volume buttons, Mute & action button4. This model is close to 2 inches shorter, due to the exclusion of the volume ring5. Echo Spatial Perception this means if two echo dots are in the same general area the one you’re closest to will respond to your inquiry.Is it Worth it to upgrade? Well if you already have the other Amazon voice controlled items in your home….probably not unless you want to add a few more to your setup. If you’ve never purchased one before, definitely scoop one up! By the way they come in several different packages, let’s check it out!On the Amazon Website:Black or White Echo Dot 2 $49.99 All of the following packages include the 2nd Gen Dot + Bose SoundLink Mini II Carbon $213.99 + Bose SoundLink Mini II Pearl $213.99 + Philips Hue Starter Kit $99.99 + TP-Link Smart Plug $69.99 + Ecobee3 Smart Thermostat $249.99Plus there are 2 other sweet deals here, if you by the Echo Dot 6pk you get a free Dot, and if you buy the Echo Dot 12pk you get 2 free DotsSetup is very easy- once you power up the device, the rest is done on your smartphone. I’m giving this item the Techfit360 around the world and back thumbs up!",0.882352941176471,"positive"

5,"MikeyLikesIt","October 24, 2016","The new Dot 2nd gen is an absolute steal at $50. IMO, it's preferable by far over the Echo due to its price, compactness and flexibility. I bought an Echo just before they announced the 2nd gen Dot and after using them both, I would have gone with two Dots instead, had I known about it at the time. The Dot has AUX out, enabling its use with external speakers or a stereo system. The Echo must be used with its built in speaker and though it is better than the Dot's speaker, there are many external, amplified speakers on the market which, when coupled with a Dot, would  sound better and be less bulky than the Echo. I'm using mine with a Bose Soundlink Mini and have also tried it with main stereo system using a Denon receiver. It sounds great in both cases. The Dot's internal speaker isn't bad at all for its size. It doesn't sound tinny at all, but don't expect any thumping bass. If all you need is some light background music, news/traffic updates and voice control functionality, the Dot alone will probably be fine, as long as you're in reasonably close proximity to it. If you want room-filling hi-fi music, you can always add a quality speaker afterwards. In certain situations, for example in a room where many people hang out, the Echo might be preferable due to its omnidirectional speaker, compared to Dot with an external speaker, which would be more directional.The only feature I miss is the rotating top bezel on the Echo that serves as a volume control and is easy to use in the dark or without looking. The 2G Dot has replaced it with volume up and down buttons. If they were to add an AUX out to the Echo, it would be a tougher call between the two models. It would be great if they added an optical out (toslink) to the Dot, along with a high dynamic range setting. Google added these to the last Chromecast Audio and, for wannabe audiophiles, it makes a significant difference in sound quality.Although Amazon's Alexa has a significant head start with voice control/home automation, it's still too early to see how things will play out, with Google and others entering the space. Being able to try out each platform with inexpensive devices like the Dot before deciding which to commit to will be great. Hopefully the others will follow suit.",0.75,"positive"
5,"Kenny","December 21, 2016","I would say that I have tried most of its features. I had it read The Stand by Stephen King to me, and it does it well enough that I know what it's talking about. The weather is as accurate as predicted weather can be, and when you set up your news feed, it does so flawlessly. I would say that nine out ten times Alexa recognizes when i'm saying her name. I'm not sure what it is but some times I'll have to say her name upwards of ten times for her to listen. This is STILL not a reason to deduct a star. She is just so smart!",1,"positive"

3,"Pon","March 20, 2017","It's getting better. The Alexa software still needs more. I'm considering buying one for every room for home automation, but there are some things that are lacking. Location awareness would be most helpful. Let me explain...Say I do have one in every room, currently you can speak the command and the one nearest to you responds. We're halfway there. Now let's say I'm in my bedroom and I ask it to turn on the lights, it should understand that since the Dot in my room is the closest to me, it should turn on my bedroom light. Or turn on my in-suite bathroom lights if I'm still in my bedroom and ask for the bathroom lights to be turned on. Yes you can assign names to lights in different rooms, but trying to remember all the names given to each light in each room can get confusing. especially first thing in the morning. Or I'm walking in the front door and ask for the lights, the lights in the room that I'm in turn on. Location awareness. depending on which Dot or Echo is closest to you that is already the one that responds. Now lets fine tune that make home automation seamless. I'm sure people would buy more.Better voice recognition. I understand the privacy concerns. Make it an Opt-In. It needs to recognize who is speaking by the voice print samples. That way parents can feel set up voice ordering of stuff from Amazon.com or other sites without having to say our PIN out loud. Umm... saying our PIN every time we order is a security nightmare. so much so that I have the feature turned off. I wish I could use it. Especially for Amazon Fresh orders. But I have some very smart/clever kids at home and all they need is to hear the PIN once and I'll be receiving things I didn't order or authorize to be ordered.",0.5,"netural"

So... they love it.  They ask Alexa questions, get all kinds of music, Use it as an alarm clock, check the weather in the morning, oh, and her jokes are way better than Siri's.  They like it so much they take it with them when they travel!  We are in the process of hooking it up to their light switch so they can turn lights and fan on and off - that should be even better!",0.666666666666667,"positive"

The reason the Echo is so inexpensive is because once you start using it, you will want to incorporate more and more smart devices in your home for her to control! But with each smart device I buy, the more comfortable life gets at home. I'm so glad I joined the Echo Dot world!",0.875,"positive"

Unfortunately, the input lag over Bluetooth is way too high. At times the audio is over half a second behind the video. We had to switch back to our old Bluetooth speakers which don't have nearly as much input lag.For music and Alexa interactions, it's a great device. Unless Amazon can fix the lag via an update, the Echo Dot won't be a part of our entertainment setup.",0.25,"negative"

5,"Honesty","December 16, 2016","Update: I'm so VERY impressed with Amazon Echo, I purchased another! Best part was I was given the option to pay $10 monthly as opposed to the whole $50 in one payment.I truly highly recommend this to be in every home.~*~*~This is hands down the best investment purchase I have made this year so far.  A product I thought I didn’t need but is now one I wished I had purchased a long time ago. Alexa has quickly become our robotic family member.Family and Friends have been enjoying all her features, especially her funny jokes. I am so impressed by her that I plan on purchasing two more, one for the downstairs and the other for the garage.She can be used with the enclosed speaker only or hooked up to other speakers.  I currently have her set up to our soundbar mixer.  Unlike my hubby she can hear you from across the room.  Every question has been answered, every song request played, any sports update provided, homework questions correctly answered, etc.  She does everything but the cooking and cleaning.  Best part is that now Hubby asks HER the endless questions and no longer bothers me, his other women in his life  We wake up and ask her for the current news and the weather.You can also purchase other items to be controlled by her.  Here are a few things that are available for purchase separately:• Phillips Hue Smart Bulbs• Serena Window Shades• Honeywell ThermostatThese are only a few that I have found.Installation was done within seconds.  I was able to also sync her with my Google calendar so she reminds me of my tasks and appointments.There is also a Amazon Dot Skills app you can download on your phone or tablet.  Many to choose from and easily connects to your PRIME MUSIC account. I got excited to just ask her to play songs from my era and she instantly plays the song.Every home should own one or two of these! She is not only knowledgeable but entertaining. Friends visiting have decided to immediately purchase. Plus I love the fact that she is small and I can easily move her around the home. I highly recommend Alexa to everyone.All-New Echo Dot (2nd Generation) - Black",0.888888888888889,"positive"

4,"Peter A. Cohen","January 23, 2017","Echo Dot is easy to set up as long as you have a smartphone (iOS or Android, doesn't matter). The ability to understand context is still threadbare, but it's an interesting effort. It's helpful and useful as long as you understand its limitations. Lots of ""skills"" to play with but discoverability of these skills is still very obscure. All told, a work in progress, but a finely designed piece of gear well suited to early adopters and patient mainstream consumers who understand that this won't do everything yet.",0.818181818181818,"positive"

With 2 small children it's great to be able to do some of these things hands free.

3,"kaljclo","November 19, 2016","I am one of the Prime members who bought the Echo when it was first released and I loved it.  I only had the one and it was getting to be a hassle transferring Alexa from my kitchen windowsill to my daughter's bedroom to play her music at night, so I decided to get a Dot.  The first gen was unavailable when I tried to buy one but soon after that the 2nd Gen was released, so that's the one this review is for.I'm incredibly underwhelmed.  I didn't expect the same level of performance as I got with the Echo, but this little guy is next to useless.The most disappointing thing about him is the lack of voice recognition he provides.  I have the Dot sitting on my daughter's dresser, which is about 5 feet from her closet where I store her cloth diapers.  I typically try to tell the Dot to turn her music on from the closet while I am getting her in her night time diaper and it never works.  Somehow I keep forgetting and I keep trying and I just continue to be frustrated every night when he doesn't hear me (I come from a family of loud people and I do not mumble...it shouldn't be that difficult to pick up what I'm saying).  Her room is otherwise silent so there's no noise interference, either.  I have to walk over to the dresser and put my face about 6"" from the Dot for him to recognize that I'm speaking to him.  I don't really see the point in having this device if the voice recognition feature is useless...The sound is barely audible if there is *any* other noise in the Dot's general vicinity.  My 6 year old was horsing around in my kitchen about 2 weeks ago and he knocked my beautiful Echo out of the window and she shattered all over my kitchen tile.  The horror of that occasion is a story for another day, however, as I only mentioned it because yesterday I was cleaning and wanted to listen to some festive music at the same time.  I lay my head on the Dot where I must put it in order for the da** thing to understand me and asked it to play me a holiday station on Pandora.  I started to walk away and realized by the time I got to my daughter's doorway I couldn't hear the music at all in my otherwise quiet home.  I walked back and attempted to ask him to turn the volume up, but alas...with the quiet tones of holiday music emanating from his body he couldn't hear me even from half a foot away.  I pushed the + button repeatedly until the Dot was at its full sound capacity and walked away again.  I went into my bedroom, which is directly around the corner from my daughter's bedroom door, and the music was completely inaudible again.  Back to my daughter's doorway I went.  I realized that I'd have to stand in her room to hear the music at all.  If I had the Dot in my room and wanted to jam to music, even at full volume, I would *definitely* need an external speaker.  I don't need my home reverberating from the bass of my Dot the way it does with an Echo at full volume, but I did expect it to be at least USABLE without dishing out the dough for a Bose audio system.All in all, I am honestly disappointed with this purchase.  If I wanted something I have to plug into an external speaker to use at all, and be within kissing distance of to activate it, I'd plug my phone into my sound bar and use that (hint: I don't).  With the Google Home out now and the potential it has to be much more than the Echo has to offer (not to mention that it's about $40 less), I think I'll forego getting another Echo and try out a different device.  I'll always think fondly of Alexa, but I think it's time to move on from the Echo products.",0.458333333333333,"negative"

3,"S.V. Hawk","November 5, 2016","I had echo dot v2 for a bit over a week now and I really like it. I have hue lights and it is nice to be able to control them with my voice. The sound quality without external speaker is passable in a small room, but not going to be enough in a larger room/house. It also not really good for music without external speaker, though, the music is kind of ok unless you care a lot about the sound quality. But again, it is not that loud by itself.There are also few problems I don't like. First, it is quite often misunderstands me. Sometimes it would turn light on in a wrong room (e.g. kitchen instead of bedroom), often it would misinterpret the music I would ask her to play. Sometimes her voice would become mechanical for no apparent reason.Also when I was setting it up, it had issues connecting to my router. It found my wifi with no issues and could see both 5 and 2.4 GHz networks. But when I would enter the password (and yes, it was correct), it would say that it can't finish the setup due to connectivity. And then suddenly without me doing anything it just connected and everything was fine. I think it happened right after I accidentally had the box ""save password to amazon"" checked (amazon really wants all your passwords)But overall I really like it. It is pretty handy and is useful. But I think it is more useful right now if you have smart devices, than for anything else due to technological limits and lack of integration.I am considering buying Echo Tap, to have her on the go, but probably will hold off because she is not that useful outside of the house right now. Would be grate if Android phones could have her as an assistant.UPDATE:I found what I think a fairly big issue with Echo. It does not have any protection when other devices try to connect to it via bluetooth. It can act as a bluetooth speaker for your phone, and what this means anyone with a phone in range can just connect to your echo and play music.",0.655172413793103,"positive"

I use it primarily with Spotify for music (hooked up to an external speaker that I already had), but the kids love to have Alexa tell them jokes or other tidbits of information.  I've hooked it up to a TP Link outlet, and use it often for news, and to set timers.  I ended up buying one for the basement family room as well.  I am continually discovering new things that the Dot can do.  These Dots are a great deal, and I've already bought a couple more as Christmas presents for some people on my list.",1,"positive"

I have a ""full size"" Echo for my main living area...but it's nice to have Alexa with me in my office playing some soft music in the background.  :-)  Plus she's there to tell me a dirty joke when the need arises.

My Echo DOT never could use the Capital One skill to login to my Capital One account. Fail, fail, fail, fail, fail.  While I do believe that Amazon is on the right track with Alexa, I also feel that the Echo DOT is more hype than anything else.  As it matures, perhaps one day I will try it again.

It could also help save many steps for anyone whose mobility is limited.",0.8,"positive"
1,"LegalEagle","March 7, 2017","If Alexa didn't have so many outtages, I'd give it 3 or 4 stars, but it frequently goes down.  (The internet is working when it does - with one exception, a Kasa outtage, Kasa worked even when Alexa was down).  We had an all day outtage when Amazon's cloud died 2/28.  A few days later was a day of Kasa outtages.  Then last night and early this AM we had a 3 hour Amazon cloud outtage.  There is no phone tech support, and Alexa can't TELL you when it's down.  The frequent downtime makes it a frustrating toy and you wouldn't dare use it for important stuff like home alarms, alarm clocks, thermostats, heaters, electric locks, etc.  Theother flaw - it misunderstands many words and simply can't do a lot.Edited 4-7-2017 -With time Alexa, Echo and Kasa have become more nightmarish and less useful - each time the power goes out (and that happens with some frequency in the south) Alexa, Echo and Kasa EACH play dumb and won't reconnect with wifi (funny how my phone and laptop have no such issue)... so I have tomanually turn the lights on and off three timesper bulb and do three manual reconnects and then do the same for every smart plug - the process takes about an hour for 6 items as the automatic modes on Kasa tend to fail... the sad thing is that as they upgrade software this gets worse... if I could give ZERO stars I would.  This is simply NOT ready for retail.  Great idea.. lousy programming.",0.363636363636364,"negative"

The home automation integration is really useful, and I found Alexa to be increasingly useful.... at first.The first month with Alexa was great, but there are annoyances and limitations that have left me less excited as the first few months progressed.The biggest annoyance is that, no matter the placement of the Echo Dot, sometimes it doesn't ""wake up"" or respond to the trigger word. Sometimes I find myself yelling Alexa before she responds. I've tried placing high, or low, near, and far, but it doesn't change. Background noise is not an issue either.Alexa seems to become less intelligent/useful as time passes - ordering anything via Alexa is a chore, and I usually just skip it, using my laptop or tablet to place the order.Once the initial ""fun"" wears off, and you look for practicality, it often falls short.Alexa does excel at a few things, such as home automation integration and control, as well as a great music, and audiobook player.",0.5625,"positive"

If you are looking for something that listens, executes commands, reads your amazon books, and so on to you--this is perfect.

I put my two extras in the kitchen (because I got tired of telling Alexa my shopping list from afar) and put the other in my bedroom.  You do not need an alarm clock, timer for cooking, perfect for weather reports and traffic reports, check my calendar for the day, set appointments for the coming week, local and national news, sports game times and scores.  Oh gezz, it does so much more!When I gave it to my daughter in law, the grandkids, learned so fast what to ask and wanted added skills.  my 8 year old grand keep asking for Christmas music.  This unit does so much and there is so much more, just have not had the time to add more skills.  It will turn on and off lights, raise and lower my thermostat, turn on my toaster oven, and so much more.  Do not hesitate to buy one of these, the volume if great for the Dot and much better for the Echo.  I love all of them!

5,"John","November 30, 2016","Well, I have to say I put off buying an Echo Dot for a long time not knowing what I would use it for. With the holiday price drop I decided to pull the trigger. I am pleasantly surprised by not only its functionality but the sound quality as well. No, the sound doesn't stand up to playing through a bluetooth speaker but for a desktop device (which I what I got it for), the sound quality is quite good. Impressive even. I am listening to classic blues music as I type this review and am loving it. Sure, if you intend to use this device to play audio in a room then you will want to use speakers. But for desktop purposes I am blown away.Setup using the Alexa app on my phone went smoothly and without issue. I went from unboxing to using in less than 10 minutes.Echo Dot 2nd generation now has a third wake up word. In addition to ""Alexa"" and ""Amazon"", there is now ""Echo"". Although it seemed as though the device responded better and quicker using the first two. In fact, I had to repeat ""Echo"" many times before the device responded so I went back to using ""Alexa"". Not a deal breaker.Alexa understands me quite well in spite of my Texas accent. I own both the Fire TV and Fire TV Stick and have experience with Alexa from those devices so I wasn't surprised at how well it understands. I haven't begun to discover all of Dot's functions yet but I can see there are many.  I am loving this device.",0.866666666666667,"positive"

I live in an apartment complex - two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part. The dot appears as a pairable bluetooth device at all times. This is a major security flaw, considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account, and is listening at all times. I will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed.",0,"negative"

Home Automation thus far includes dimming, grouping lights for on/off (with Sylvania Lightify, up to 50 lights with one hub) and now controlling the Digital Wi-Fi Honeywell Thermostat with IFTTT.  I've set a timer for things in the kitchen and set an alarm.",0.8,"positive"

I am quite surprised at what a good job it does recognizing voice.My only wishes are (1) that it used use the Google engine for queries. It's not that good at finding facts with Bing.

2,"GenreX","November 13, 2016","I have been using it for a couple of weeks now with Philips hue and a smart thermostat. I will leave the tech specs as they have been covered extensively here. I am a power user of Google now on my phone. Let me start by saying, echo is not even 20% of what you can do with Google now when it comes to search. It mostly interprets the sentences wrong and only gets it right about 4/10. The intelligence is really low. You have to say specific terms for it to understand at times. The services offered are themselves limited. No traffic information unless you specify your start and destination in Alexa app. Only music you can listen to is from Amazon store. The list goes on. Compared to how Google can search all over web and understands what you say almost always, this seems more like a novelty toy and not a seriously reliable assistant. Most skills really depend on how good the skills are programmed and most of them seem like half baked hasty releases. For the price it is good compared to google home but it's unreliability to understand and limited services offered makes this a novelty, not a serious buy. If Google slashes it's price in future or comes up with a cheaper no speaker version like dot, echo will have a hard time competing. I am hoping they update and improve their software soon.",0.684210526315789,"positive"
5,"H. Goldwire","December 7, 2016","This is an excellent product, greatly appreciated.  It is also improving rapidly.  Amazon sends many emails detailing the new improvements.  For me it the most useful for playing My Music Library and podcasts.  But note, to get stereo out using the 5.5mm jack, you must push hard on the connector to seat it into the Dot.  Otherwise you will only get then left channel.  The hole on the Dot surrounding the 5.5 mm connector should be slightly larger to permit cables to be easily inserted.",0.833333333333333,"positive"

I have close to 2000 songs and the first time the shuffling played 10 straight Led Zeppelin songs and 2nd time played Van Halen non stop.

Gives weather and/or news, tells jokes, gives info.  Amazon is constantly improving her and others are working on a variety of apps/skill and devices.  If you know someone who has internet and lives alone, Alexa would be a perfect gift.  Know someone in a nursing home?  See if Alexa is allowed, it would be a wonderful companion.",1,"positive"

I opted for this model as I already have 800 dollar Bluetooth speakers and a sound bar to connect to. I have to say I use alexa every day to set my alarms for work, read me the news headlines and weather as I get dressed, and for some music when relaxing. Cant wait to see where amazon takes this in the future. Highly recommend!",1,"positive"

It also was trickier to connect to Bluetooth, but it eventually worked.We live in Florida but listen to a radio station in Chicago. We use it for that more than anything, in addition to our Prime music.",1,"positive"

4,"Amazon Customer","January 17, 2017","Although I have set this device up and it is currently functional, I have not used it extensively.  However, when I have used it, it works very well.  Maybe a little too well.  For example I was watch TV and a commercial for the Echo Dot came on where the television asked Alexa for and update on the News.  My Alexa diligently connected me to some news report from earlier in the day.  I wasn't quite sure how to get ""her"" to stop.  Very cool device nonetheless.",1,"positive"

I think Alexa is a bit more useful while Google is smart because she knows a lot of facts. We use Alexa to actually do things.. like ORDER PIZZA!!!! While Google is just there for trivial questions...  i.e. How many countries are in Africa?For 49.99 You CANNOT GO WRONG with the Echo Dot.",0.777777777777778,"positive"

Right now we have it in our room and we use it to turn on and off our lights, daily we ask the weather while getting dressed in the morning. We like it a lot and plan to buy at least one more for another section of the house.The only con I have found is that Alexa responds that she can't help or find an answer to something I've asked. She needs a little more tweaking before we purchase a second.",1,"positive"

It's great to set a timer, ask the weather/news and to play pandora without having to use my phone.  Only complaint is the dot is not terribly loud.

The best gift we made of it was too our 97 year old blind friend who cannot believe how much it has enriched her life.  Tuesday night/ Wednesday morning  she woke up not knowing if it was day or night.  She was able to ask Alexa what time it was and then asked Alexa to play her Christmas music which soothed her so much that she went peacefully back to sleep.  She loves it so much it is really gratifying to her.  But she says she feels guilty raving so much about it to her friends at her senior living facility.  You should really think about trying to connect up with the Braille Institute to get more distribution of this wonderful device to other blind people.",0.6,"positive"

2,"gbramling","December 7, 2016","Responds to too many false positives. With the wake up word set as ""Echo"", it wakes up to random noises and conversations in other rooms. So it's too far away to hear what she's telling us, there's just an unexpected human voice talking to you from an empty room. Your grandparents will hate it. My wife hates it. I think it's funny.When it works correctly, it's pretty cool. Weather reports and simple (small range of possible choices) queries work well. Starting music works well.Note that it has an internal speaker, so might work as a standalone device in many situations. For the price as a standalone item, you can decide if you want to populate your house with 'em, or add a louder speaker.PS, the Bose speaker that is often shownn paired with the Echo is only about the size of three Echos.

You can use the Echo app with both the Echo and Echo Dot, even if you own both. I have my Echo Dot in my master bathroom hanging from a wall. It's not loud enough to hear while I'm in the shower though. I usually use it to find out the whether, add things to my shopping list, ask definitions of words while I'm watching the morning news, and more.",0.6,"positive"

I totally recommend this product you must buy this, this is an amazing Christmas gift. The only downside to the Amazon echo dog or Alexa it does not work like Siri or Google homeA lot of the things you might ask Alexa she might not able to answer it but I'm betting in the fact that hopefully Amazon will keep upgrading the Excho software or the the Alexa system and hopefully in on a couple of months or a couple of years she'll be more interactive that's the only downside, when I ask her questions sometimes It doesn't understand me. It does not answer questions like Siri or Google Home.if you have a prime membership is great because you will be able to take a vantage of audiobooks and the amazon music, again I totally recommend it!!",0.777777777777778,"positive"

Ok, she's dumb as a box of rocks.  Its not like asking google something..  My phone does everything Echo wants to do.. I do however enjoy the hands off element, the alarm and the NPR News Flash Briefing.... It was easy to set up, just follow the directions. It's tiny and can fit in the smallest space near an outlet.  I have one in my bedroom. and the other is hidden in my living room. I like it as an instant night light, an alarm, timer and basic weather and news info..You can buy pricey ""smart"" light bulbs and sockets from amazon to turn your home into a smart home. ******Just a thought, If amazon wanted to do some good. They would provid them to the vision impaired for free. They could navigate to a certain area by where the sound is coming from. The Time, Date and Temperature would be easily known. Music can be played and News reports just by asking.******",0.625,"positive"

3,"White Raven","October 30, 2016","The Dot is OK for a limited range of commands, BUT is very inflexible. Commands must be simple with absolutely correct wording & word order. ""and"" & ""all"" are not recognized so device hierarchies must be thought out and predefined or you will sit there all day listing lights to be turned off!  Commands must be entered singly with a pause & the wake up word before each command. This is very limiting.Device management & playing music is generally useful & functional, but Echo may not understand some names well enough for a successful search.The Wikipedia facility should be useful, but is marginal.  It often fails with people's names.  Echo is either limited to a subset of the Wikipedia, or the voice recognition is so bad it will only match well known or easy to recognize names &  items to Wiki articles. Existing wiki articles are not always accessed. Sometimes the ""matching"" seems random:  Echo will read a wiki entry for something that does not sound remotely like the request, or will start listing movies playing in your area when the word movie was never spoken.",0.6,"positive"

5,"Kendra jones","November 30, 2016","I've been very surprised at how loud it can get for such a small device. It also has great voice recognition. Just do a couple of the voice activities in the Alexa app on your phone and she will understand you 99% of the time. Even if there's no answer for what you said/asked her... she still heard you perfectly clear. You know this because it posts what you say/ask in the Alexa app. Overall just a neat little device... and I don't even have my hue lights and smart plugs set up yet.",0.833333333333333,"positive"

And decently priced too. There is so much more that she can do. I am looking forward to expanding my use of her.",1,"positive"

My Echo can be activated from across the kitchen.  I cannot do this with the Echo Dot - need to be with four feet of it to activate.  It may have to do with my lower octave voice or perhaps other sounds in the room.  I've had to ask it to activate several times when it is on my nightstand and I am within 18 inches (in bed).",0,"negative"

In fact, if you do have a great sound system already I would say getting one of these is better than the full sized echo because of the mini phono jack on it.  Without a sound system, the speakers in it do a fine job, a bit tinny, I wouldn't want to listen to music through it, but it is fine for everything else.",1,"positive"

The Echo Dot is so cool.  It has its own little speaker, but for good sound you want to connect it to an external speaker. I use a Bluetooth speaker for mine and get really great sound. We ask Alexa everything from sports scores to weather forecasts. We play Jeopardy too!  My kids listen to all sorts of music on it which is why I need a second one. My daughter seems to be holding my Dot hostage right now.  I love that you can order products from Amazon right through Alexa. This economical version makes a really nice gift and I'm looking forward to giving some out for Christmas presents myself.  I don't have the full size model Echo but of the two I do have, my favorite is probably the tap because of its portability. I also think the speakers pretty good to you without needing anything external. This is a perfect starter model though and fun for everyone! Thank you Amazon for creating Echo!",0.833333333333333,"positive"
3,"Nicholas Palumbo-culver","November 26, 2016","Im still learning my way around the Dot. Let me start by saying that the stock speaker quality is alright if you are in a room with minimal noise. Right away i connected via aux to a boombox so that i could get loud audio. Set up was simple, training her your voice patterns can be a bit lengthy.. especially since you have to continuously train her to recognize different speech patterns and phrases. But this is to be expected. Build quilty of the Dot is solid and love the small foot print, the device just blends in on my shelf.  I like how new skills are being added constantly. Overall satisfied with the dot.",0.625,"positive"

The mics pick up our commands from a great distance (we have an open floor-plan), almost always accurately.  On New Year's Eve, my wife asked it to play ""Auld Lang Syne"", and it took several attempts with exaggerated enunciation to get it to recognize the correct request, but that was the main exception.",1,"positive"
2,"Atomic","December 7, 2016","I purchased the Echo Dot specifically to function with my home stereo system; I thought it would be cool to control my music with voice commands.I followed the setup instructions and the device recognized my home wifi network with no difficulty, but when I connected it to my vintage stereo receiver  I immediately heard a very distinct static/white noise sound coming from my speakers. This happened with the Echo Dot volume at any setting. I tried adjusting the volume on the receiver, changing input cables, changing the power supply to a different outlet and everything else I could think of but nothing decreased the static sound. I then tried playing music through it anyway and everything sounded muffled and generally bad, not at all acceptable for my living room stereo. I understand that the Dot is an inexpensive device but I expected it to function better than this. I thought about sending it back but I guess I will just keep it and use it standalone gizmo to listen to things while I get ready for work in the morning.I had hoped for more.",0.555555555555556,"positive"

5,"I Like Stuff","November 27, 2016","I have some experience with the Original Amazon Echo which is partly what lead me to getting the Echo Dot Gen2. I liked that the Echo was very responsive and could give me news updates as well as play music. When the Echo Dot came out I looked at getting it but was hesitant to order because I wasn't sure what kind of use I would get from it and while I liked the original Echo, I didn't want to buy a lesser version.When the Dot Gen2 released I finally decided that I would give it a shot. My uses have been somewhat limited so far based on what I use it for and what other things that I have that can be controlled by it, so this will be the beginning of an ongoing review.I've been using the Echo Dot for a few weeks now and so far I really like it. I do feel that it isn't quite as good at responding that the original is but this could be due to location and room acoustics in my bedroom with other noises like the television being closer. It isn't bad by any means but I did move it next to the bed to isolate it from other sounds and that seems to have helped a lot.I didn't expect much from the speaker from such a small device that isn't a dedicated speaker but I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was. The speaker is fairly loud and generally clear at most volumes. I feel it is good enough for music playback for casual listening but wouldn't use it for get-togethers. In the end I bought an external Bluetooth speaker(Anker Premium Wireless speaker) and it is a great pairing. It improves music playback by a lot and the sound is just better overall.Currently my main uses for the Dot have been music, news, timers, alarms, general questions, and even controlling my television.For music I have it connected to Pandora and it is very fast and simple to get a Pandora radio station playing. You can also very easily turn the volume up or down or have it connect to your phone for music playback. It also has Tune In radio which features playlists for some of my favorite podcasts.I get my news feed from NPR but there are a variety of options for where to get the news, even tech sites like Engadget.I use it constantly for alarms and timers and it is as simple as asking Alexa to set them up or stop. Sometimes in the morning when I have more difficulty reading a clock face I'll just ask Alexa for the time. It is great for setting timers for laundry or cooking and would be a great handsfree companion in the kitchen.I have recently found that it can ""control"" my Samsung television.  Currently in conjunction with my Logitech Harmony Hub it can turn it on and off, thus the ""control.""  I have heard that pairing it with the Logitech Harmony Hub as well as Samsung Smart Things Hub can give me control over changing the channel and volume but I do not own the Smart Things Hub and it seems like a lot to ask. I'd really like to see something like this simplified but I understand that this cannot just come from Alexa's end and would require support from television manufacturers.  Yes it is simple enough to control the tv with the remote but it actually turns out to be convenient to do a lot with your voice like setting sleep functions or changing the source. Turning the tv on and off is limited but kind of cool.There are a lot of apps and devices that the Echo has access to so I'd suggest researching what kind of smart home devices it can control or what apps it has access to that are relevant to you. I don't have any smart bulbs or sockets currently but since getting the Echo I have started looking into them.  Also there seem to be a good variety of apps but I haven't really delved into them enough to use or make suggestions. I did recently download the Jeopardy game which initially worked very well but has become somewhat frustrating to play due to the game not hearing my answer and saying that it was incorrect and the correct answer is the one I just gave.  This is beyond a minor gripe because everything else I use it for so far works great.I think devices like the Echo will improve a lot over time and I just hope smart controllable functionality will be safely built into more devices without having to own a variety of different hubs or controls. For something still somewhat in its infancy, the Echo is capable of a lot and works very well in what it does. There are going to be issues and hiccups here and there but that is expected.  If you were to just use this for pandora, the news, alarms, and a timer I think I could still recommend it. For $40-$50 you get a lot that works well in this device. The audio quality is capable enough for most uses and it just works well in these areas. If you have a lot of devices you want to control and apps you want to use I'd suggest doing a good bit of research first to make sure it does what you intend it to and it does it consistently.The Echo Dot 2 is far from perfect. It doesn't always pick up my voice or what I say correctly and it will always be limited by its apps or other devices. Regardless of its shortcomings it is a surprisingly good device that works far more than it doesn't and it is continuing to grow every day. For the very reasonable price and it's functionality I can only give it 5 stars and recommend it to anyone that can see its usefulness in their lives.",0.821428571428571,"positive"

5,"D Garcia","November 28, 2016","My biggest question before buying the Dot was whether the volume was too low to use by itself, but the volume of this device is certainly substantial enough to not need an external speaker, especially if it's being used in a location where music isn't one of the top uses. I have the full-size Echo in my kitchen/downstairs area and it fills the first floor with music most of the time. The Dot is in my bedroom and is used more for information & smart home use, but is great for the morning news briefings and occasionally playing music in the mornings while getting ready for the day.When I shop on Amazon I rely heavily on other people’s reviews to help me make the right choice on what to buy and what not to buy. I depend on other people’s honesty to help me make wise choices when purchasing items here on Amazon.com. So in turn I always make sure to leave my HONEST opinions on products that I review. I try to give as much detail as I can when I can without being long winded. If you have any questions for me on something I failed to mention, please ask and I will respond quickly.

Icing on the cake is that everytime I try to use Alexa and she fails, I see the lovely Amazon logo that makes me hate Alexa/Amazon all the more!!!

Unfortunately, it only answers certain types of questions. That being said, we currently not Amazon Prime subscribers and it may well function better if you are. Also, we do mot have a ""smart home"" so we were not attempting to access that functionality. May parents basically utilize it as a weather radio as they are not Amazon Prime members either.

5,"Lanette","November 10, 2016","This device and software, affectionately named Alexa, is amazing.  I have had her for one day at the time of this review, and I already can't praise it enough.  First and foremost, I am impressed by the wide variety of things she is capable of doing.  There are the basic functions (alarm, timer, weather, news, random questions), but there are also ""skills"" that you can enable her to have.  In the Alexa app, you can choose these skills and add them to your device.  I would liken the ""skills"" to downloading apps on your smartphone.  In the same way a smart phone has many capabilities but you usually need to have an app to use the function, so are Alexa's skills.  For example, I live in Chicago, so I enabled the bus tracking skill.  Now, before I head out (or, rather, while I'm rushing around to try and get ready in the morning), I can ask Alexa when my bus is coming so I know how quickly I need to get ready.  I can even have her set an alarm or timer for when I need to be leaving.  I set my alarm on my phone to wake up, but I set Alexa's alarm for when I need to actually leave.  When my head is in a million places in the morning, that helps me get going on time. I also have the Hue lighting, so she can turn the lights on and off as well as dim them to whatever level I desire with a simple command.  There are also a lot of random skills that might be fun to play with also.  Traditionally, when I need groceries, I make a shopping list on one day for all the things I need.  However, I really like that as I'm cooking or looking through the fridge, I can ask her to add something to my shopping list that I would have probably otherwise forgotten.  If you need something, Alexa can probably do it.I know there are a lot of questions regarding the speakers on the Dot.  I have also been using it to play music.  For me, I think the speakers are sufficient.  I live in a smaller sized one bedroom apartment.  I can't really hear the music if I go to a different room, but since there aren't a lot of options for me in that regard, I think this is perfect.For those of you that are pouring over the descriptions, reviews, questions, and internet about choosing between the Tap, Echo, and Echo Dot, I will speak to that.  I did a lot of research prior to purchasing the Dot.  Initially, I wanted the Tap.  I liked it because of its speaker, small size, and that it was portable from room to room.  I thought for sure that's the one I wanted, and was pretty settled on it.  Then, I looked into the Echo.  After digging into the details on that device, I was torn.  I liked the portability of the Tap, but the echo was attractive for two reasons.  First, I liked that it would be ""always listening"".  I liked that from anywhere in the room, I could said, ""Alexa...."" and get a response.  I thought that, especially if I were doing something like cooking and had messy hands and needed to ask a question, it would be harder to use the Tap because I wouldn't be able to use it comfortably.  So, suddenly, I found that I was settled on the Echo.  However, I kept looking and I saw that the Dot went from unavailable to available.  This added another layer to my search.  I researched the Dot and became increasingly convinced that I would like this device.  Like I said, I live in a small apartment.  I don't really have a ""central hub"" of the house and then other rooms in which I would want a device, so I did not find those reviewers that were choosing the Echo as the main room's device and the Dot for smaller rooms, helpful for my decision.  It basically came down to this- I had never had an Alexa device before.  I wanted an always listening device, so I was down to Echo and Dot.  I decided I would start with Dot.  It is smaller (fitting for my space) and cheaper (so if I didn't like it it wouldn't be so bad).  I am so so happy with my decision.  I love it. I have used it so much more than I could have imagined.  If the Echo goes on sale or something in the near future, I would be happy to purchase the larger Echo and have the Dot as an alarm in my bedroom.I know there are other devices on the market from major technology companies that are starting to rival the Echo line from Amazon.  Although I haven't tried them personally, based on my research the Amazon devices are superior to anything else.Bottom line, tl;dr- I love the Dot. It is perfect for me and I highly recommend it for you.  You won't be disappointed, but if you are, Amazon has absolutely amazing customer service that can help you with that :)",0.769230769230769,"positive"

I have successfully asked Alexa to ""Play CNN"", and it has always done that since I first started using my first Echo.  In the past 12 hours it no longer responds to this command, asking now what I want to hear, specific stories, latest news, etc. it will only play the CNN audio stream by forcing you to go to the Echo app.  I documented the issue in an email to Amazon!  They said I needed to call them directly to work on the problem.  I did, and spent more than 30 useless minutes on the phone with their representative.  At the end of my conversation with their representative she stated that it was CNN that changed the way my Echos respond to the command ""Alexa play CNN"", and I should contact them.  I would not know where to begin to do this.  Amazon's support regarding my issue, and most likely many other users who regularly listen to the CNN audio stream, via Tunein, was unacceptable.",0.444444444444444,"negative"

4,"Thomas A. Amoroso MD","November 27, 2016","Very impressed with this device.  Particularly pleased with the integration with other home devices; I can tell Alexa to turn off the garage lights, and the garage lights duly shut off (this does require setup, of course - like putting the garage lights on a controllable switch - but that only needs to be done once).  Plays music without difficulty, from a variety of sources (Amazon, of course, but also Pandora, Spotify, several others).  Voice recognition works remarkably well, all things considered; I've only been able to confuse it when there have been several people speaking at once. (Including a loud 3 year old standing right next to it.  That's a challenge most humans couldn't beat).  Currently there are only 3 ""wake words"" (words which tell the device to listen up; they are ""Alexa"", ""Echo"" and ""Amazon"", and can be set in a menu via the app); I would prefer to have that be a settable parameter (and if people choose to abuse that, well, so be it; adolescence is not a phase you can bypass.  I promise you the kid won't call his Echo ""b*tch"" or equivalent once he has a girlfriend, or for that matter a boyfriend, regardless of gender; one wants to make a better impression than that, usually).So why the 4 star review, you ask?  One word: search.  At present, Alexa uses the incredibly lamerpants Bing search engine, by apparently unalterable default (if they meant for it to be changed, I rather expect that feature would be prominent.  It is not in evidence; Moreover, the internet (based on searched using a real search engine, to wit: Google) has been unable to find this feature either.  I thus assume it does not exist).  I suspect that Amazon has taken money from Redmond to implement this.  My advice if so: give it back, and implement real search, using the customer's choice of engines.  You'll make up the money in units sold. Trust me.",0.714285714285714,"positive"

It most certainly does not compare to the echo but, you can pair it to a Bluetooth or plug an auxiliary cable to a speaker. I use the dot2 as my alarm clock.

5,"Vincent","November 29, 2016","Yes, it's a slim down version of the Amazon Echo* without the speaker.*For this review I'm going to refer this item as the 'Dot' and the  'Amazon Echo' as the one with the speakers incorporated in the deviceIt functions exactly the same except the voice for Alexa is not as smooth (probably due to the speakers in Amazon Echo).You CAN play music on the Echo Dot without a speaker plugged in. Compared to the Amazon Echo you won't get the surround sound feature, but it's pretty decent if you're one who focus more on lyrics than instrumentals. There's an optional Aux 3mm plug in and bluetooth compatibility if you find the sound coming from the dot less sufficient and want to use an external speakerThe Echo is very portable. Fits in the palm of your hand. Love how the plug on the Dot is detachable unlike the Amazon Echo so it's easy to tranfer to a new location when you need to.Setup is very easy, just download the Alexa App and following the directions included in the box.Features wise, it's similar to Siri, Ok Google or Cortana: you can ask it questions, make shopping lists, schedule appointments, play music, set alarms, link it to Pandora/Spotify/iheartradio, see traffic updates, sports updates, news briefings, use as smart phone device, voice purchasing off amazon, among other of features. For full list of features or suggestions are present in the app and the e-mail news letter if you sign up for it.Going to go through some of the features now and what you should look out for:-Alarms: If you own multiple echo devices (Dot, Amazon Echo, and/or Amazon Tap), alarms is device specific. Good for if you have one in the master bedroom, the alarm will not go off in the child's room for example. Whatever you voice set the alarm with, it will go off on that device. Also note that the Echo devices are wifi and power dependent. If there's a blackout or if your wifi is down the alarm will not go off-Voice activation: if you own multiple echo devices and they're within the same proximity of each other, best to assign different wake words for each so both won't go off the same time. You have the option for 3 wake words: Amazon, Alexa and Echo.-Voice purchasing: look out for Alexa only deals. There are variety of discounts only offered through Alexa like how the special offers on Amazon Tablet works-Smart Home. By far the best feature in my personal opinion is the smart phone feature. You do need a smart plug or thermostat that's Alexa compatible, but it makes your life much easier by just using your voice to control the temperature or on/off the lights without having to walk up to the switch or console.Overall very good device to have around you home as it improves on your quality of life, and makes life similar if you own a smart home device. I'd get this over the Amazon Echo if you own your own high quality speakers as it's essentially the same device without the speaker. If you can chip in a little more I'd go for the upgrade as the speakers on the Amazon Echo is really good, if you want to compare it to your own home speakers I'd go check out the display demo that are available at some retail electronic stores.",0.896551724137931,"positive"

5,"Ren88","November 27, 2016","tl;dr: Useful and fun. Definitely worth trying given the relatively low price, even if you haven't got any smart home stuff. I just wish it had a battery.I'm having a lot of fun with this so far. I haven't got any smart appliances/bulbs/etc. but there's still a lot you can do with it. If nothing else it's interesting from a user interaction perspective, and for the price I'd say it's worth getting one just to have a new experience. The assistant on your phone can do a lot of the same things in terms of setting alarms and telling the weather, but having something controlled entirely by voice has a different feel to it, and Alexa seems more personable and natural to interact with. Once you have the right skills enabled it actually tells you what you want to know instead of just pulling up a web search. The range on the mic makes it really convenient to set timers when you're working out or cooking, and you can even set the alarm to have the guys from Grand Tour wake you up which is pretty amusing. On a more practical note, I think being able to control everything with your voice could be really helpful for people who have vision or mobility difficulties.A big part of the reason I got it was to help motivate me to work on programming, and after playing with it for a few hours I can't wait to try making a skill. I was always told that learning goes a lot better if you have a project to work toward, and this is great for that.The only thing I wish is that it had a battery. I assumed it did, and that plugging it in was just to charge, but it needs external power at all times. I'm planning to get a USB battery pack for mine.",0.95,"positive"

I'm really glad I did. We've only been using Alexa and the dot for 2 days but I feel like I've already gotten my $$ worth out of her. We didn't have a radio hooked up in our house, I know right, get with the times. For just the music alone it's worth the buy! I love that she's able to hear me no matter what room I'm in on the floor of the house we have her in. She's understood what I've asked every single time. I love the ability to get the latest news, weather, and more in an instant. I love that I'm able to set alarms, reminders, and even order via the dot. (Although I've not done this yet, I did set a passcode. It worried me that my toddler could purchase things if he wanted!) Which brings me to the fact that she even understands my 4-year old. He's asked her to play some of his favorite songs and she does, right away. I am an android user and I thought ""I don't need this, we have google and it does everything this alexa does!"" Which is true, but I am so glad we have this now. I'm not sure if I would have preferred one of the bigger models or not, but this has great sound and works very well. My only regret is that I didn't buy one for every floor of my house.

The other day my power had gone out overnight and I kept thinking I should set my stove clock every time I walked by but didn't have my phone. Duh! Alexa what time is it. Fixed. I'm getting older and it's easy to space on the shopping list. Alexa, add milk to the shopping list. Then when at the store I just open the Alexa app and look at my shopping list. Fixed. I think Alexa is going to be my new best friend. Lol. My setup is using a Hook SmartHome server with etekcity switches. The advantage is the cost. The hook talks wifi to rf. The etekcity switches are rf and only $5 per outlet vs. $35-40 for wemo. So now Alexa turn tv on, Alexa turn living room light on. Love it! Now if only Next up when budget allows will be a Logitech Harmony - wifi to IR to control the apple tv, dvd player etc. Alexa Channel 5. Alexa pause movie. Now if only I could find inexpensive light controls. Alexa Night mode! Someday.Oh, and Alexa is really awesome at picking music for me, I've listened to a bunch of new artists and the idea of needing to work on a playlist is vanished. Alexa Music! And so easy to Alexa Skip or Alexa Thumbs Up. Five Stars - but would give 10 if I could.P.S. I gave some thought to purchasing Echo instead but had some speakers so went with the dot. I'm glad I did. Not only less expensive I've found that sometimes Alexa can struggle hearing the wake up word if the speakers are close and loud so I plan on keeping the dot at a bit of distance from the speakers.

5,"M. Sims","December 9, 2016","When I first heard of the new and improved Alexa Dot, I knew I had to have her in our kitchen!  When she was delivered a few weeks ago, it was like Christmas!  I'm a geeky/techy type woman so having her in my house was exhilarating.  She tells us the weather, the news, but I find we use her more to listen to Pandora (which is free).  I simply say; Alexa, play Pandora, and she responds that she will play my last channel.  Its really great to hear the teens get into it and talk to her and ask her to ""Turn up the volume"", and ask her trivia questions.  For $49.00, it was such a fun and great investments.  What's better is that additions to what she can do is added to her so she's not stuck where she was when first introduced or purchaased.  There are still things I need to learn to do, like 1) Learn to operate her from my cell or computer instead of physically being in the room (not sure if its possible, but will find out) 2) Learn to change the News Flash to WTOP so my husband can call up the news and traffic before leaving for work.  Overall, you cannot go wrong with Alexa, the thing is remembering she's there and using her.  Sometimes I honestly forget she's there.  I would recommend you get her in White if your appliances or surroundings are black.  This way she stands out more.  She's in our kitchen sitting on the computer stand which blends in too well.

First, for the price, we bought 3 for less than the cost of one of the more expensive version.  One for the living room, one for our bedroom, and one for the family room.  We then connected it through Bluetooth to our soundbar in the living room, which gives a much better music experience than the full price echo would.  Downstairs, we connected it with a audio video cable to our surround sound system, and in the bedroom, we don't really listen to music, so we didn't bother hooking it up to a speaker.  Even if you don't have a speaker already, you can buy a much higher quality bluetooth speaker for about $100 on sale, so you are still coming out cheaper and will have a better sound experience.  Also, being that this is already the second generation of the Echo, I feel like they will continually come out with new versions, so why would you want to spend a ton of money on a speaker that is going to be obsolete.",0.555555555555556,"positive"

Paying less does not mean the quality has been compromised, its amazing. You can literally shout from opposite end of a large room and Alexa will light up ready to take orders from you. The best part is your integration with amazon music, amazon shopping, shopping lists etc. I extensively use amazon music. All my playlists and favorites are not just a voice command away.I never thought I would use it to this extent. I never imagined the voice recognition would be so accurate. I am so amazed by the product, I am actually getting some other compatible devices like lights and switched today. It would be wonderful to ask Alexa to turn of lights and other electronics. I hate switching off lights in the night after I have settled in my blanket.For anyone who likes advanced technology, this is as close as you can get to AI for this price. I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. I mean 50$ for this level of automation and technology is just ridiculous. I get her to do my news briefing every day. I play music every day. Another great thing is connects to any other Bluetooth device with a voice command. I had PC speakers of really good build just lying around. So I permanently hooked them up with my tap, and it works so well. I have a bluetooth speaker in my dressing room which is a bit far away and with one command, it starts playing music in that one instead of the ones I hooked it up with.

There are still some questions which Alexa is not programed to answer (I suppose it has to do with which search engine answers are pulled).  However, my Echo Dot is wonderful.  Within minutes I was comfortable with her and my voice was easily recognized (repeatedly).  I enjoy the positive and supportive apps. I give it 5stars because it does just what I want it to do, when I want it to do it.  The Echo Dot has picked up my voice from across a master bedroom and she has picked up my gentle whisper in the morning. I am most pleased with how easy it is for me to put something on my calendar and to know it syncs with google calendar.  I plan on taking full advantage of the shopping and to-do-list as this will support me since I often forget what to do and get. I am amazed at how well it works, I foresee Amazon making even better strides with it. I have never used technology which provides responses and information as fast as it does.Since the Echo Dot doesn't work on battery it always has to be plugged in.

5,"Mike S.","November 24, 2016","These are (in my opinion) very handy, and has more and more functionality being added all the time.  I have one ""regular"" echo unit that I mainly play music on in a bedroom, and use the dot down in the living room to do things like update a grocery list, turn lights on and off (which you will need to have some kind of smart plug like the TP link smart plugs to do), get weather and traffic updates etc.I see them as being as useful as you want them to be.  The echo does most everything through skills you enable through the Alexa app, or tell the echo to enable directly.  Some of the skills that can be enabled are pretty useless or just for fun, but others like the alert my buddy app (which can alert a list of people you need help) can be very useful for people with medical conditions that may incapacitate their ability to move easily, or seniors at risk of falling. Some things, like acting as a timer or alarm, playing musing in your Amazon library, accessing Wikepedia,  or checking on your Amazon delivery status etc you do not need to enable a skill to do. That it can do on its own.I have found that it responds to and understands commands most of the time very well.  It mainly only has problems when there is background noise like from a TV.  Occasionally it will understand a question just fine, but not know the answer.  You can check the app to see what it heard, and give it feedback on whether it did what you wanted it to in response.It is definitely not something that everyone will find useful or see as a must have.  But if you have seen the commercials or looked into it and are intrigued by at least some of the things it can do, then I definitely think it (the dot especially) is worth the price.  You do not need to have the more expensive echo unit for the dot to work.  It is its own unit and can do all the things the echo can do, the only difference as far as I can tell is that the ""regular"" echo is a better speaker than the dot.  The speaker output is pretty tinny compared to the more expensive echo unit.  You can play Pandora or iheart radio on the dot and it sounds fine, but I do not think the sound is as good on the dot as it is on the regular echo unit.The setup is very easy.  I know some reviewers had a very hard time getting it set up, but I did not encounter that at all.  You just download the Alexa App to your phone or tablet.  Plug the echo into the wall and use the app to configure it.  Basically you have to connect it to WiFi (which it did for me very quickly and without a problem) and then read through a list of about 25 commands to configure it to your voice.

I worry it might make impulse buying too easy, but so far so good. I love that I can tell her to order C batteries and they come two days later. Gone are the days of running out of a household item and forgetting to go online to re-order for days/weeks.- Play music. We got Amazon Unlimited and I got rid of my Spotify account. We have yet to find a song Alexa can't play. Sometimes you need to try a few times to remember the name of the song, but that is mostly user error.- Nighttime white noise machine. I'm a light sleeper, but I quickly realized that Alexa can soothe my sleep by playing waves or any other white noise on  Amazon Unlimited. I've created a few sleepy time playlists, and at bet time I say ""Alexa, play my sleepy time playlist on loop"" and she'll play it until I tell her to stop in the morning.- Alarm clock.

It is a very boring, mono tone voice, but it is great to fall asleep to.3) I get my morning news and quick weather while I'm making breakfast4) I do have my work calendar hooked to my google calendar and can have the Quick Events skill give me an overview of what I've got going on at work.5) Play music including radio stations from around the country6) There's fun games and jokes that can be be played. Some of the skills are pointless and are just people adding them to get into a drawing.7) Find out what movies are playing and when at my local theater8) Turning on the living room light when we arrive home with my hands full.The speaker is useful for what I use it for. I do have a Bluetooth speaker that I do use with the dot without issues.For the price point of the dot I find it fun and useful.

I recently bought 2 dots during the black friday deal and neither dot holds a connection for more than 10 minutes... they are located in the center of my small apartment and in my room, both of which have extremely strong wifi signals. My Echo, which I gave to my girlfriend, has never lost a connection in my apartment. I have other devices such as laptops and phones which consistently use my wifi, so I know it is not an issue of my network.I have a bad feeling that Amazon mass produced these dots knowing that they would sell like crazy. In the process, they cheaped out on certain hardware that makes connections reliable. It is literally so annoying I may have to return. I was in a rush this morning and tried to ask about the weather and I see the blue light stagnate for a few seconds and then turn bright red and Alexa voices ""Sorry your connection was lost"" or something along those lines. In total it works about 50% of the time. While I am streaming music, it will constantly be interrupted for 10 second intervals where it drops my connection.",0.5,"netural"

It's seems just as wonderful as the Echo (at least so far, I just plugged it in), apart from one small irritating thing...  The plug!!!  It comes with a wall adapter and then the cord from the Dot plugs into a USB slot on the wall adapter.  The adapter is 2 inches long and once you plug the cord in, it sticks out an additional 2 inches.  Since this in for my bedroom, I was really excited to plug it in behind my dresser.  Well, that didn't work.  My dresser was now 4-5 inches from the wall.  SO ANNOYING!!!  I found an iPhone adapter (one of those small little white box things) and plugged it into that.  This bugs me so much.  Seems like such a stupid design flaw.  Be prepared for the plug to stick out 4 inches from the wall wherever you plug it in.

Just ask for an artist, or just tell Alexa to play some prime music. It follows your selections, & when you tell it to pick something it's very very close if not exact to your taste. I have a remote with my Bose so I can adjust the sound level, but if you don't, Alexa can even make the sound louder or softer. I bought mine on Amazon's black friday sale which makes it even better.

3,"A. Kim","December 15, 2016","I've owned the full-sized Amazon Echo for about a year, and have been generally happy with the device, so decided I would give the new Echo Dot (2nd Generation) a try in my office.  Although I knew not to expect great sound quality from the small built-in speaker in the Echo Dot, I still found the sound quality and levels disappointing.  No problem though, I thought, as I have a Bose Soundlink Mini bluetooth speaker (the first generation Soundlink, as opposed to the Sounlink II) available to use with the Echo Dot.  I had no problems pairing the Soundlink with the Echo Dot, and was able to enjoy good sound quality from the Soundlink when paired with the Echo Dot for playing various Amazon Prime music stations.  However, I have since discovered a design flaw/oversight that dramatically decreases the usefulness of the Echo Dot for my arrangement.  If I ask Alexa to stop playing music (in order to take a call, for example), the bluetooth connection with the Soundlink will eventually time out because the Soundlink will power off if nothing is playing after a period of time (maybe 15-20 minutes).  When this happens, the Echo Dot automatically resumes playing music through its built-in speaker, even though my last command to the Echo Dot was to stop playing music about 15-20 minutes earlier.  This obviously is bothersome (and embarrassing) when I'm in the middle of a work call, and all of a sudden the Echo Dot starts playing music right next to me.  This also happens whenever I manually power off the Soundlink speaker while it's connected via bluetooth to the Echo Dot.  I can't understand why the Echo Dot would be programmed to restart playing music whenever an external bluetooth speaker connection is terminated, even though nothing is playing when the disconnection occurs.  Perhaps my Echo Dot is defective, but I suspect this is just a bad design flaw/oversight.  I've since decided to return the Echo Dot, and just purchase another full size Amazon Echo for use in my office, and skip the whole bluetooth speaker connection problem.",0.4375,"negative"

My entire home is set up with Philips Hue bulbs and TP Link switches for the more analog devices and this little hockey puck does a magical job controlling them, playing music, reading me the news and reminding me to do things.

2,"N. Marquart","January 31, 2017","The good:From a technology standpoint, this product is amazing, particularly the speaker array that never seems to have trouble picking up the ""wake"" words.  It has easy setup and bluetooth integration, and the amount of skills that are coming online open it to more creative applications than just a hands-free audio receiver.The bad:Amazon has not been forthcoming with what data this picks up and forwards to the cloud, especially when Alexa is not actively being used.  I mostly used my Echo Dot for weather/news in the morning, but it seems to be streaming data back constantly.  Just recently, after hearing a number of baby toys making sounds in our living room, Alexa turned on without prompting and said ""Here's some kids music I think you'll enjoy."" which was FAR more creepy than it was useful.The fact that the Echo Dot had been streaming to the cloud without prompt (despite its own FAQ: https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201602230) left my wife and I a bit too uncomfortable to keep this on.  The short return period means that this will probably end up being an expensive hockey puck or coaster.

This is a problem when i want to use one at work, and my wife wants to use one at home. If we link accounts we lose amazon music in one of the accounts. The need to unlock how you set it up.The Dot functions well, and is very responsive. That is the good!This could be easily fixed by allowing me to attach a music service to the specific Dot, and not the account as a whole, but there is no way to do this.This is frustrating enough i have can only give 2 stars.",0.444444444444444,"negative"

5,"VC","October 24, 2016","What made me made up my mind to buying one of these is that about half a month ago. I visited a friend in New York and he has a ""Big echo"". Although to me the most usable smart device he has is his many light bulbs, to control the lights when we can ""talk on""  the light when entering the apartment in the evening. Let alone you can ask Echo to play music anytime when you are ready and the sound quality is not bad at all for such a small device. It seems really a convenient life with the help from Alexa.One main reason the has kept me from buying one, the most advanced voice robot is that I think the price is a little high for me. And one day just before the Echo dot launches, I accidentally found out there would be a cheaper version of Echo release soon so after a short while of hesitation I just went ahead and placed the order.Now after 2 days since ""she"" spent with us, I am very satisfied lol. Alex works way beyond my expectation, she can answer almost any quesitons and arrange everything for me. I am surprisingly happy with her high recognition of my voice as well as the sound quality she phonate.The design is quite unique as the speaker is located at the bottom of the device, strange ha? but don't worry, those holes on the side not only release sound wave smoothly but also IMHO amplify the sound evenly from the direction I talk to her.To start using it is pretty straight forward, just follow the few steps and after 20 voice train sentences I was good to go. Would definately recommend this product to my friends who has never had a chance to try it out.Only minor complaint about it is that, because I mount it on my TV stand in  my living room so Alexa can ""see"" me when I talk to her, the echo has to be upside down if I put the charging cable downwards, other 3 buttons looks fine but the mute button looks definately Wrong(see pics). If I want to put the Mute button right, I have to put the charging cable upward with leads to another issue that the charging wire is too short. My TV stand is less than 5 ft tall and I mount the echo on the top corner, my power outlet is on the ground just for your reference.Other than that small issues, I'm perfectly satisfied with this device, it changes my opinion on voice device after using OK google for years on the Moto.

1,"J. Philly","December 28, 2016","I think this product is still very early stages and has not matured yet.PROS: Cheap, Easy to setup, a bunch of useful skills that can be enabledCONS:- The one thing I need this to do is to control my Nest Thermostat, and the skills for it is not matured yet. Commanding Alexa to control the thermostat is NOT very natural, and you have to MEMORIZE the lines. For example, ""Alexa, TELL THE THERMOSTAT that I am going away"" would work 2 out of 5 times, and why can't I just say ""Alexa, set the thermostat to away"". Sometimes if I say, ""Alexa, ask the thermostat about the setting"" versus ""Alexa, ask the thermostat what the setting is"" I get two different results.- Sometimes it would just turn the FAN on because the device did not hear me correctly.- There is little to no integration with IOS/iPhone unless I do with through IFTTT- I feel like the voice command of the iPhone (Siri) is way better than Alexa.- EDIT: Yesterday, I just asked alexa maybe 2-3 times to set my NEST/Thermostat to away and she couldn't understand what my voice command was and she turned red and said something like ""connection was lost"" or something to that effect. I am experiencing this more and more. It was frustrating.- EDIT: If she doesn't understand my voice command, there's no feedback.

5,"Dan","October 25, 2016","I've kept my eye on the Amazon Echo ever since it came out.  However, for a person that owns a home, it only makes sense that you would want one in almost every room.  Buying a handful of Echos at $180 would have been too much of an investment for me.  So I sat and waiting for a better solution.  Then this new 2nd Generation Echo Dot came out for $50.  This was more of the solution I was looking for, so I purchased several of them.Installing them and setting them up was a  breeze.  The clarity/quality of the internal speaker really surprised me.  I wasn't expecting that kind of sound from such a small package.  Also, if you have a couple of rooms where you want even better sound, you can just plug in a couple of amplified stereo speakers (I will most likely do this in my living room).I have Samsung Smartthings Hub (for home automation) and Logitech Harmony Hub (for video/audio automation), so my ultimate goal was to be able to walk through my home; turning on/off lights as I enter/exit rooms simply by speaking a simple command.  I also wanted to be able to just speak to control my TV, Roku & Amp.  This new Echo Dot does this flawlessly.  Though I've only had these installed for about a week, they have performed admirably and help to complete my home automation project.The Dot has several internal microphones.  These microphones are very sensitive.  If the room is quiet, I can almost whisper from across a 20' room and the Dot will accurately receive what I said.  If there are other audio sources playing at the time (like a loud TV), you do need to speak up, so that the Dot can recognize that you are trying to communicate with it, and that it isn't just the TV.  This is to be expected, and short of the Dot having a camera that constantly has it's eye on you to visually recognize a command spoken to it, you will need to speak a little louder than the other sources playing.The Echo has many application add-ins known as 'skills' that you can add.  There are over 1,000 of them, and that list continues to grow.  However, many people don't know that a lot of power is added to the Echo by use of IFTTT.com.  Until Echo gets a Logitech Harmony skill, you will need to use IFTTT to control the Logitech Harmony from an Echo.I also like the size of the Dot.  I wanted small devices that I could add to my rooms and hide, so that no one would know where the voice was coming from.  This not only makes the room more aesthetically pleasing, but guests are always trying to figure out where Alexa's voice is coming from.  It makes your smart home just a little bit cooler.There are many fun things you can do with the Echo.  You can add games to it, have it look up movie trivia, local business information, give you the time, add wake up alarms, set timers, etc...  This said, for $50, this is just about the highest value in electronic devices you can buy.  Besides it being a great value though, the Amazon Echo Dot also makes your life easier.",0.904761904761905,"positive"
4,"Syngen","December 11, 2016","Get a Dot, not an Echo. A Dot will pair with Bluetooth speakers and you will get the sound quality you probably expect, even if you're only a causal listener to music like myself. Audiophiles may want $200 speakers but $50 ones worked for me. The Dot is a recorder of your voice to follow commands and not really a speaker. The Echo has a tinny speaker that is difficult to understand when it talks and music is just OK, even for someone like me who is not an audiophile.You can download the Alexa phone app to set it up but you will find yourself less frustrated if you use the Amazon Alexa Home website.

5,"Gadget Guy","October 27, 2016","A few months ago, I struggled with getting the Amazon Alexa. I wanted it but didn't want to pay $179 for it.  About a week into deciding to get one. I found out the 2nd generation Dot was being released in October for $50. I couldn't pre-order one fast enough. The pre-order release date was October 20th but my delivery date was Oct 26-29th. So I waited patiently until on October 22, a few of my friends that had also pre-ordered, started receiving their Dot. I guess because they were Prime members, they got it faster.  I stumbled across Best Buy website and found out that their stores had them in stock.  So I canceled my pre-order with Amazon and ordered my Dot online at Best buy and picked it up later that evening.This is a great little gadget!  I love it!  I use it to turn my TV on and off. Its great to add items to your shopping list as you run out of things. Its also great when you want to hear music as it pulls songs from either your Iheart radio, Pandora, Spotify or Amazon account. Simply speaking your request.  I've stood about 12-15 feet away in my bathroom, with the water running and it still responds.  Its pretty witty as well. ""Alexa, good night""and it responds ""good night sweet dreams.Set up took about 10 minutes. All of my friends who visit now want one. Even the ones that are non tech types.  I plan to get a few more Dots to put around the house as well as add some wifi light bulbs and outlets.  As a kid I used to watch Star Trek and dream about these gadgets.

1,"JD in Rochester","November 25, 2016","I already have both Echo and Tap. They are great products with sound quality beyond belief for their size. Echo is the best and has the Alexa trigger word. Tap does everything Echo does except no trigger word - you need to push a button to talk to Alexa - however, the advantage is that it is portable and operates on it's internal battery anywhere in the house. That brings us to Dot - it is the only one that has the ability to provide audio output to an external sound system. I planned to connect to my stereo either via its blutooth or output jack connection. I knew that the smaller box would sound tinny, but thought that the audio would be acceptable if patched through to a good quality stereo. Wrong. The audio that Dot sends sounds just as tinny through the stereo as it does through its own tiny internal speaker. I would liken it to a small transistor radio from the 1960's.So, my Dot might get sent back until there is something that meets this need and performs as I would expect. Or, this Dot may sit in the kitchen to more easily have Alexa add things to my shopping list - with the poor sound quality, it is good for little else than that.",0.75,"positive"
5,"Finny","October 24, 2016","We have ten echos in my home.  A full-sized Echo, one of the 1st gen dots, and eight of these new dots.  We obviously like the platform, and have a great deal of personal experience with using all of the different versions of this personal assistant.My wife and I have slowly converted my home light by light, door by door, and even my security system to being compatible with and function through Alexa.""Alexa, turn on the lamp,"" ""Alexa, turn on the fan,"" ""Alexa, lock the doors,""  ""Alexa turn on the heater,"" ""Alexa, turn on the tv..."" and on and on.We purchased the eight new dots to add them to children's bedrooms, to our exercise room, to our home theater, and to our entry way.  No matter where I am in my house now, one of my ""Digital wives"" as I refer to Alexa... can hear me.Pros:This new echo is smaller, lighter, and far less expensive than the original, including the original dot.  It is well built, feels sturdy, has loud volume, and seems to function well.  Even in the parts of my house where I am really stretching wifi, due to distance.With our audible subscription, and with a healthy supply of several children's books that we have purchased over the years, each of my kids can have a personal assistant read them to sleep each night.  Which is nice.  They each pick whatever story they want, from The Cat In The Hat, to Harry Potter, to Jane Austen, and listen to a book as they fall asleep.  They are getting very adept at asking her to read their favorite book.She is also great help for homework.  She explains things they don't understand, looks up endless random facts, and is much quicker than a calculator would be.  She is an excellent ""digital mother.""  (Again, a joke... sort of...)I find myself getting frustrated with the appliances that don't yet work with Alexa.  ""You mean, I have to actually lift my hand and push a button!  I can't just ask Alexa to do it!!  That is sooo last year!!!""It is small, unintrustive, out of sight, yet always there whenever I say her name, and ask her to do something.My favorite is ""Alexa Trigger I love Anna.""  I have this setup to email my wife that I love her, text her that I love her, and flash all the lights in the house pink several times!Cons:As much as I love my digital wife she is not quite perfect.  She has her quarks and her flaws.Only one person can use her at a time:Amazon added a new feature with this release to account for the fact that multiple Echos can hear me throughout the house.  This is nice in that it ensures that only one echo ever responds when I ask her for help.  However, an unintentional consequence is that with nine of us in the house constantly turning things on and off, and asking her questions, we have quickly learned  that only one person can ask a question at a time.  If my son across the house is talking to Alexa, I can't.  She will ignore me.  It is fine once he is done making his request.  ie, if he starts a book.  Once the book is actually playing I can then  make my request.  However while he is actually talking, she will only listen to him.  I can't engage her on any other echo in the house.This has been annoying on multiple occasions!  They need to allow me to setup which Echos are close to each other, and which are far apart, so that the far away ones can operate independently.  Another option would be to program her to recognize voices, and distinguish between requests coming from different people.Can't make multiple requests:I should be able to say ""Alexa turn on the fan and the lights"" or ""Alexa play music and set the volume to 8""  Instead I have to separate each request into its own sentence, ""Alexa turn on the fan.""  Then wait then ""Alexa turn on the lights.""My kids can turn my bedroom lights on and off:This is probably the most annoying thing about our setup.  My kids can say ""Alexa trigger Dad's lamp"" and cause my lamp to turn on and off.  There needs to be a way to restrict certain skills to certain alexas.  ie, when I walk into one room I shouldn't have to say ""Alexa turn on living room lights.""  I should instead be able to say ""Alexa turn on the lights"" and have it know that I am in the living room based on which echo heard my request.  Likewise I should be able to block access to certain lights or features on specific echos that are in other rooms.All in all though we love the technology, and will continue to invest in it.  Amazon has already made many improvements, and I have no doubt that they will make many more!",0.694444444444444,"positive"

5,"Greg Hallock","November 9, 2016","I have both the first and 2nd gen Dots. They're surprisingly versatile devices.  Want an alarm clock with no persistent lights at all? It does that.  Want voice control over your lights, thermostat, music, or kitchen fire alarm? With the right devices, it does that.Need a joke? Alexa has a few decent ones, and quite a few stinkers.While the speaker in the Dot is tiny, tinny, and mediocre at best, it is sufficient for everyday interactions, or for music if you aren't picky.  If you ARE picky, it can output audio through a headphone jack or Bluetooth. And the audio quality output to my 20 year old Bose Mediamate speakers is very good.  And being able to deal with my music hands free while cooking or otherwise occupied is very useful.All of that would have gotten 5 stars for me. After all, this is a $50 device, and very very good at what it does. But to really put it over the top, you have the easter eggs.  Alexa knows who Shot First.  Alexa knows GlaDos though they have drifted apart. Alexa does not think that word means what I think it does. Alexa knows it is a trap, and is taking evasive action. And Alexa Sings Happy birthday.And as an added bonus for gamers, the dot can roll virtual dice, and flip coins.

5,"R. C. Lewis","October 29, 2016","I have a Wink controller, and have been adding home automation here and there around the house. I live in a three story home, and have added Dots to each level.Amazon Dots were easy to sync to my wireless and I linked them into my Wink account (or Wink was linked to Amazon app).  I have had no problem in setup, nor does Alexa have difficulty in hearing me.  In fact, when reviewing the video I just created off of my phone, Alexa started to respond to the video audio!On the top floor, I have the Dot as a stand alone and use it for an alarm clock, verbal bedroom thermostat (Nest) adjuster, and 'weather station'. I bicycle commute to work most days, and it is nice to know what to expect outside when I am getting up and getting prepped (ie warmer cycling clothing or cooler needed?).The downstairs Dot is in my office and currently is only answering questions and changing the second floor thermostat which impact temperature on the lower level.The second floor / living room Dot is connected to my Marantz stereo receiver (Monster 3.5mm to RCA cable).  My receiver is not wireless nor does it have Bluetooth. The Dot plays music through my receiver with decent/good sound quality. It also can turn on and off an automated outlet that is connecting a lamp in the living room.The Dots do not currently see nor control my automated front door lock or garage door, though Wink does.I have uploaded a short video that shows some of the automation in my living room being controlled by Alexa and Wink.  Sound quality in this video is not that decent; it was captured off my phone.  Don't mind the mini-tour, or my fur-balls.  I did not mention this in the video, but I can either ask Alexa to up the volume from the Dot's end, or I can manually change it from my receiver's controller.Let me know in the comments if you have any questions.",0.6,"positive"
5,"Amazon Customer","December 19, 2016","By purchase order, I first bought the Tap, Echo, then finally the Echo Dot. Here is my review:The Tap:The tap was awesome. I spoke to Alexa every time I needed to set my alarm, cooking timer, and sports update. It pretty much went with me wherever I walked around the house (barracks). The speaker is terrible though, so I wouldn't recommend getting it simply to use as a bluetooth speaker. However, I haven't used it since I got...The Echo:The Echo is flat out amazing, and brought me into a sublime world of home electronics I never new existed. It's always on, so I found myself saying ""goodnight"" and ""good morning"" to Alexa everyday, and saying ""Alexa, play some music"" the moment I got home from a long hard day at work. It's not portable, but the speaker is better than the Tap (not $50 better anyway). It's sturdy with that ""cool touch"" feel I like that makes it feel rugged and high quality. However, I haven't use it since I got...The Dot:The Echo Dot is literally EVERYTHING the Echo can do, but it's like a fifth of the size and less than a third of the price. It's literally a no brainer (btw, the Dot also has a speaker, but I wouldn't recommend relying on that for music spread throughout the house), I have it connected to my Klipsch Promedias, which were made to not turn off so the Dot is always on, ready to blast any response or play any music with my awesome speakers.tl;dr: If you have unlimited data, the Tap may be a better option.  If you don't have awesome speakers, the Echo may be a better option.  If you have awesome speakers, the Dot is DEFINITELY the best option.",0.884615384615385,"positive"
4,"Donald Sensing","November 20, 2016","I got this on something of a lark. My son has the $179 regular Echo and when I visited him it seemed intriguing - but not enough to spend 179 bucks on. So I pre-ordered the Dot when it was announced.Basically, this is a talking toy. I do find it convenient, though not essential, for checking my calendar or the latest news shorts or getting a quick weather forecast. It also tells really lousy jokes and is handy for a countdown timer or an alarm. But I do not really get a lot of utility out of it -- mainly because I am not willing to lay out the major coin it would take to make it the controller of a smart house. The hardware for that ain't cheap, sports fans.So I give it four stars for doing what it's advertised to do but for my personal usefulness I'd give it only one or two. If you are willing to spend lots of money for smart devices, you'll probably like it a lot. I think.Now for the Alexa smart phone app (I use Android). It's used for setup and once you're done with that, it's mostly a tutorial. There are a fair number of ""skills"" you can activate on the app for the Dot, but most won't be useful to you or any other individual user. What you cannot do with the app do is use it away from home as a voice-responsive Alexa app. So away from home I use the MS Cortana app. Or the Google app. How awkward is that? So Amazon, get Alexa on the smart phone app already. But of course, if you did that, why would you need to sell the hardware?And that, IMO, is the conundrum: it's a software, cloud-driven piece of hardware that does not really require the hardware.",0.764705882352941,"positive"
2,"Diane Bunch","December 4, 2016","Works as a voice-controlled timer and clock radio, except it often doesn't quite understand me. I run the voice training every day, but I notice no improvement. There should be some way to correct her by typing in the phone app. I ask Alexa to play the radio station KCSN; she plays KCSM. I ask her to play the program ""Dylan Hour;"" she says: ""I can't find the program The Deliverer."" I ask her to play the radio program a Celtic Sojourn; Alexa says: ""I can't find the program ""Celtic So Jordan.""The to-do list is so frustrating. I plan step by step what I am going to do, telling Alexa to add each step to my to-do list. Then when I ask for my to-do list she says: ""Here are the last five items on your list.

5,"Yau Know Jimmy","October 24, 2016","This little thing is an amazing little gadget! I currently have this on my desk hooked up to my Z623. The echo dot comes in a small little box with a power cable and a manual. The manual has simple direction anyone can follow, simply by connecting it to a power source, connecting it to your speakers (via bluetooth or aux cable), connecting it your wifi, and then simply by downloading the Alexa echo app onto your mobile device. It took me about 5 minutes to set everything up with syncing all my accounts onto the alexa app (such as pandora, iheart radio, phillips hue lightbulb). Every time i enter my office i immediately tell alexa to turn on my lights, play my music, and sometimes ask for the weather and time. The echo dot has 4 buttons on the top volume down, volume up, mute, and the action button. The volume button exactly what you think, if you want your music lower or louder you can simply press any of the volume buttons. But since you have the echo dot, why not just ask alexa to turn the volume up/down.  The mute button is for cases where you do not want Alexa to hear you so you can press the mute button and a red ring will appear to notify you that it is activated. Lastly the 4th button which shows as a dot is the action button. You can use the action button in place of saying ""alexa"" and tell it a command. I personally dont know why you would use this button since you just bought a voice controlled gadget. The Alexa app is also really easy to maneuver around. It keeps a history of everything your echo is doing as well as syncing your devices and accounts to your echo. It has features of telling you the traffic from destination A to destination B once it is set. It has the cabaility of telling you the weather, making you a to do list, shopping list, timer, alarm, order pizza, set up an uber driver to your destination and even reading you a book from audible.com. This small device has a lot of potential and with Amazon's focus on the echo line they will continue to expand this further in the future. This device is definitely worth every penny. I will soon pick up a full Amazon echo to place in my kitchen as I do not want to have a full speaker system laying on my counter, but I still want the full capability that the echo provides throughout my home.",0.75,"positive"
5,"Langevinrox","December 20, 2016","Not too shabby. Currently this item is $39, which is great for the price point. It acts as a home hub and completes several other functions. I mostly enjoy asking about the weather locally and places I plan to visit. I enjoy having music just a few words away. I like the bed time stories and the flash briefing. I'm going to use the weather, traffic and local news every day before I go to work. I also like checking on my favorite football team. My only complaint is that it uses the Bing search engine which is really sub-par. There are several simple questions that it just seemingly can't find an answer to. There could be a bit more ... common sense. When I want iHeartRadio to play, I go through 3 phrases, all with the same meaning but worded differently before getting to actually work and I can't voice control iHeartRadio except to get it to resume, which is still good, it'd just be nice to be able to use voice to change stations .I hope to add some lights and other stuff.

3,"Coticon","November 12, 2016","Let me start by saying I really like the Dot.  As a piece of hardware - it is small and smart looking - but let me reiterate the term ""smart"" - because in the software and programming, the Echo and Dot leave a LOT to be desired.  I am used to using ""OK Google"" on my smartphone and getting the answers to just about any and everything - that I find Dot's inability to do the same things, a terrible short coming.  For instance - Alexa can not translate any languages - and questions at least 50% of the time come up with ""I'm sorry I can not find the answer to your question"".The good - the voice recognition of all who speak to Alexa and her reception ability are exceptional.  But her music playing ability while good for what she plays - comes up very short in many areas for example: when you ask for new age music, she plays the same songs each time, when you ask for waltzes, it plays something akin to jazz, when you ask for Chinese or Italian music, she says she can't so this, when you ask for mood or candle light music she again can't so it, and when she does play songs of a certain genre, more often it will be only one or two songs then she will stop, when she says she has connected you to a given music station, I found it curious that what I am told is live music are the same songs that played the day before and the day before that.  Even though she says ""shuffling O don't find that to be true in any sense of the word but a genuine shuffle with a large library of a given genre would help a lot.One drawback that I found to be an unpleasant surprise is that with more than one Dot connected, when music is played, it will only play at the location where the request was made - what is critically needed is the ability to designate which if the several Dots around the house should ""echo"" the Echo that is playing the music.While setup is very well done to get Alexa on lne anything more detailed is very very difficult.  I purchased the Dots to give my Veralite home automation system, voice control - and after about a week of work  I still am not there, and even though I am confident that it will be fully implemented shortly ... it ""ain't"" easy - involving Raspberry Pi, programming in Java Script to create the Bridge between Alexa and Vera and lots of internet and YouTube advice.So in summation - right now Echo and Alexa are primarily a music-playing, Amazon-ordering device (although if you don't have Prime cancel the latter), with a few other bells and whistles thrown in (e.g local weather and news), but has a long, long way to go to reach where she should be and what is in fact available today.  As a retired computer engineer, programmer, hardware builder, and IS program manager who goes back to the days when the Apple I (no not the II), was being first marketed with the Altair and MITS- I appreciate the technological marvel that is Alexa, but I also know that the software and programming are not quite state of the art and truly wish for more; fortunately, since all of the capabilities are ""cloud-based"" Alexa's abilities can and will be improved/expanded - but this has to be done very soon and very well, or other systems will overtake this wonderful product which would be a shame because she has great potential",0.740740740740741,"positive"

I found set up Alexander app quick and easy. We have utilized different name options.The voice training was useful. I noted reviews that flagged difficulty with voice commands. I have noted with alarms having to request multiple times to turn off but otherwise voice commands have been almost flawless for all members of the family. Music playing not equivalent of my Bose speaker which was not expected but is rather good. For anyone with busy morning routines I have found the timers and voice commands invaluable...We have actually been getting out of the house on time. Love the weather option so we know whether we need jackets, shoes or umbrella is just a voice request away. Children will love the option of asking questions. My son's favorite option has been requesting music. Coldplay that he has played on Violin and ""Baby Lullaby"" at bedtime have been his almost daily request; doesn't get any sweeter.At the price point of $49.99 +tax the Echo dot is a definite buy for families with children. I have noted reviews seem to focus on sound quality.but the real issue is should be utility and incorporation into daily life.

My only gripe with this device is it's strange tendinces when asking questions, it can answer what is overwatch. But it dosen't know what battlefield is, a strange occurrence. This item is also great with family members as everyone can have an echo dot in their rooms and, have a full amazon echo on the main floor. They are also indipendent meaning you don't have to have the full echo to use the dot. One recommendation I would make is to use a external speaker, the internal one is pretty weak.

2,"Rudy","November 14, 2016","Warnings- You will need a smart phone or tablet in order to run the initial setup. Luckily, I had one, but this requirement is not obvious upon purchase. Also, it is important to note that Spotify will not work with the Amazon Echo line of products unless the user has a premium account subscription.Music- If you already have (or can afford) a premium Spotify subscription, then I would actually highly recommend a device from this Echo product line to have the power to play any popular song at the command of your voice. The Amazon Prime music offerings are much more limited than Spotify (1 million songs vs 30 million), but if you have Amazon Prime you could get a taste for a similar experience. Lacking the premium music subscriptions to either, I was only able listen to Pandora radio stations, but found that there wasn't a great advantage in having this voice control option to play radio stations alone and generally deferred to other devices where I could play individual songs on demand. I also found it strange that there was no voice command option to increase/decrease volume.Home integration- I played around with the idea of purchasing smart switches and light bulbs (and getting fancy with IFTTT) in order to create a smart home, but ultimately decided that it was going to be more trouble than it was really worth.Other Thoughts- When left sitting idle, there were a handful of times in the two days of use that the device falsely triggered (thinking it heard ""Alexa"") and tried to answer questions. My kids did have fun asking Alexa basic questions and requesting jokes but the responses were fairly limited and the novelty soon wore off. This was a gift.

Living with this diminutive gizmo for the past couple weeks, however, I've come to find a number of its available features useful, and well, fun.The PotentialThe future potential for this device becomes evident once you start using it, and come to rely on its convenience of use. For instance, you can ask for a forecast, the time of day, and my favorite, set a timer (comes in handy for doing stretches, yoga, what have you). Its draw is that it's fast and convenient: instead of having to fidget with your smart phone you simply give Alexa the command. It only took a few times before getting used to telling the Echo to turn on a music station on Amazon Prime. Now I use this feature daily to listen to music (so my house is more often filled with music as a result).There are already a lot of available ""skills"" you can enable on your Alexa, and the list is growing all the time. One function I am looking forward to is Alexa to be able to control my Roku through voice commands. There is a hack for this found on GitHub (*UPDATE*: see the attached video - I just implemented it using the code on GitHub with a little bit of modification), but I wish Alexa had this function built-in. Since Roku is the hub of all my streaming it would be convenient to be able to tell Alexa to start an app and search for a title to watch. I know I could use the Roku remote to do voice commands, but I do not use it in favor of a universal remote. This would be an incredibly useful feature for Alexa (without having to spring for something like the Harmony Hub for another 100 bucks or so).The Pros-The main pro for this device is how affordable it is. I honestly would not have bought it to play with it if it cost more than 50 bucks. At this price it's almost an auto purchase for someone like me who simply wanted to play around with it and experience it for myself.-The voice trigger -- the so-called ""far field"" mic -- is sensitive. The Dot was able to listen to my commands from a different room with no line of sight to it, from about 18 feet away.-Echo's brain lives online, so the local unit doesn't need to have hefty specs, and I imagine would not need to be upgraded often -- all the learning and improvements takes place at its central servers, your Dot simply serving as the gateway to all that is offered and will be in the future.The Cons-I have my Echo Dot connected to my main home theater receiver (through the 3.5mm jack). I wish I could tell Echo to connect to a Bluetooth speaker located in another room. This is not possible currently if you have it connected through the 3.5mm port since that takes precedence. However, I believe you could pair with multiple Bluetooth speakers (not multicast, but one at a time) if you solely use the Bluetooth to connect.-Alexa speaks okay for a robot of today, but the machine reading in general could use some improvement. Often some words are jumbled together when Alexa is saying them to where it becomes unintelligible.-A small nitpick but I wish I could name my Echo its own name of my choosing. So instead of having only 3 trigger names to choose from (Amazon, Alexa, or Echo) I can customize my own.Overall, Echo Dot is a good purchase if you want to experiment with setting up your home to become ""smart."" At its current price it's definitely worth a try. Plus my kids love it, ""Echo, ask for a fart,"" is their current favorite ""skill."" Gets them laughing every time.",0.842105263157895,"positive"

For example, Alexa is unable to perform ""Alexa, set an alarm titled 'call your mother' for 10am""Siri can do this without a problem. In fact, I've found Siri to be a lot smarter. Siri can build off of your last command, and can make phone calls which is awesome.I considered returning this but ultimately kept it because my wife enjoyed checking the weather hands free.

5,"Patrick Glose","November 22, 2016","I'm sure there isn't much to say that has not already been said, but I did want to give koodo's to the developers of this device.  My home already has nice sound, the price of the echo was just not in my electronics budget at this time.  I was very excited when I found the Dot, and for the price, I had to give it a go.  I've only had it for about a week now, but we love it (her).  Many Easter eggs built in, and just asking her to play a song, a group, or genre and have her do it is delightful.  Right now, she's hooked up to my Denon through a 3.5mm jack, but the Denon doesn't offer bluetooth.  I'm working on adding a bluetooth HDMI adapter.  As for automation, I am a bit of a tinkerer when it comes to gadget and cool stuff, so I went on several hunts when Alexa arrived to our home.  From what I can tell, if you're looking to automate (lights, thermostat, etc), you will most likely need a hub.  At first, I thought I'd need several hubs to support different manufacturers devices.  Seemingly, not so.  The Samsung SmartThings hub ($50 on Amazon right now) not only has support for most device manufacturers, but also has (and the coolest part for me) open source platform (Amazon also has open source).  What this means is, like Android, anyone can develop ""skills"" (Amazons name for an app or program).  The market is going to flood with new skills and devices from people like me who love building tech.  So, like I said, there probably isn't much I can say about the Dot that hasn't been said, but there is much to be said for the Alexa environment.p.s., the microphones (7 of them) are amazing.  She can hear me from a good distance.",1,"positive"

First off I find it incredibly handy with my wifi lighting and even bought a tplink wifi power outlet that now i dont have to crawl under my xmass tree to shut it off.  The radio is so perfect for the holidays and in general.Its loudest volume isnt going to boom but it will be clear and you will have to speak over to another person but alexa will still hear you really well.  I have used it numerous times now to make sure im not late with clock and timers and it also keeps me up on my deliveries and even pizza.  overall they are just beginning to get this device going.  It is capable of so much more.  The microphones are supposed to determine which one you are closest too for where the command will execute which is nice.  Be careful of echoey spots like the bathroom as that often tricks it in thinking you are closer.NOW for the wish list.One thing I didslike is I cant control other dots from another.  When the other room accidentally starts playing music you can tell all rooms to stop. I have 5 echoes.  Also I would like to turn on music on every device too so that I dont have different songs playing in different rooms/  There needs to be some continuity.Now my biggest pet peave is appliance awareness.  Using a common term like turn off lights should note which dot is hearing it and execute that command for the lights you specified near that dot.  This does not exist.  You current have to tell it which lights to turn off.How is there no phone calling possible through this excellant speaker and mic.  Also a builtin find your phone feature via bluetooth would be cool so if it is closest to one dot and has a stronger signal it could tell you which room its in.I recommend these despite the wish list.  I have seen daily headaches dissappear wtih all my connected devices and I really like it in conjunction with the Logitech Harmony remote works pretty well but there needs to be more detailed added to that skill.",0.958333333333333,"positive"
1,"Jackson Roykirk","January 3, 2017","I received the Echo Dot as a Christmas gift and after at least three hours with both voice chat and then someone named Jaipreet on the typing chat, figured it to be defective because it would not finish Alexa install process. Beware if you have any devices over a couple years old because the Alexa app that is required to run the Dot will only work on newer devices.Alexa would install on my iPad but not my iPhone or my Samsung Galaxy tab. it will install on my wifes year old Kindle fire device but my wife is not interested in the Dot at all but uses her Fire to browse Facebook or shop on Amazon.Older Kindle Fires will not work.My problem now (along with thousands of others) is that the new Dot keeps dropping its network assignment..it says nothing when the connection is lost but will tell you through the  Alexa  app the next time you try you try to use the device. I have fiber-optic cable to my house and my router is an ASUS RT-AC1900. Both Dots were 18 feet from the router and they keep telling me that I have Internet problems. COME ON. Looks like i will need to spend another three or four hours on-line to tech support or maybe buy a dedicated T-1 line to maybe get this working. If you have one and it is working fine then bless you. I you are considering buying one yourself then be sure all of your other tech that must run the Alexa app is up to date or buy a new phone or tablet that is on their list also.Right now all I have is an mp3 player that must be reset every hour. If it wasn't a gift it would be right back to Amazon. The Dot is not ready for prime timeThis is an update to my previous review - I have moved it everywhere possible and it will still not stay connected. You can re run the setup program and the Dot 2 will disconnect within minutes. My verdict is that the DOT sucks as well as customer service. There are no help links on the Dot page and Echo Dot customer service links are well hidden. If you do happen to get customer service, they do not speak English well enough to understand you and seem to be reading all of their instructions to you from a written script.

3,"Argh","October 29, 2016","I think mine is defective. When there is any ambient noise in the room - anything from a sizzling frying pan to low playing music - it can't hear me. I can literally put my face right in it, and yell, and it doesn't respond. It's excruciatingly frustrating. My Echo does *not* do this. I'm returning it with the hopes that the replacement actually works.***Update: 12.29.16: I received a replacement Dot. It still has difficulty hearing me, but it isn't nearly as bad as the first one. If an audio book or music is playing, it still can't hear me over it - even if the sound is coming from the Bluetooth speaker instead of its own internal speaker. However, I no longer have problems with it hearing me over the sound of running water or sizzling meals. I've also learned that strategically timing my words helps. I mostly use this for listening to Audible while cooking or cleaning in the kitchen, and also use it to set meal timers. If I wait for the second of silence in the timer, or wait until a pause after a sentence, I can get it to hear me from across the room. Frustrating but functional.It still amazes me how our full sized Echo in the family room can hear me over its own speakers when I'm in the kitchen, but the Echo Dot in the kitchen can't hear me from a few feet away. ***",0.285714285714286,"negative"

But when one of my Dots failed under warranty, I expected ""Yup, we understand it's broken; here's an RMA number and shipping label, thanks for your loyal custom"".Instead, I've so far spent an hour doing stupid things for an off-shore script reader who's trained to help newbies with configuration problems.  No RMA, no label, just ""try running setup on another network"".  Duh, it's dead, Jim. Actually not quite - it receives power and lights the little yellow LED. Never finishes (or starts?) booting. No light ring activity. No voice greeting. No log entries suggesting she heard me but couldn't answer. No wifi connection to my AP.The script reader knows nothing about any of that - almost certainly has never seen or used one - and presses on with the next frustrating request.Don't not buy one - I don't know if Bezos recognizes his opportunity to develop a sentient creation (with the help of Alexa's millions of 'parents') or is disappointed that she's not selling more Amazon merchandise, but in any case she's a joy. She'll respond instantly, as a person would. Nary a trace of 'computer' in her voice makes it easy to humanize her.

5,"momof2","January 26, 2017","We love our dots. We now have 4 dots and one Echo in several rooms through out the house. We use the Echo in the kitchen to play music when we cook. It is perfect for adding items to the shopping list as you use them or as you look through the pantry and realize your out. My boys have one in each of their rooms which when paired with the HUE lighting allows them to be tucked in bed door closed and still turn off all their lights... they think this is the best thing ever. Each morning they wake using the repeating alarm, ask ""echo"" what the weather will be so they can choose their clothing for the day. I have also combined this with IFTTT so that now I just say a trigger phrase ""Amazon trigger boys come here"" and it flashes the lights in their room so that they know we need to talk to them (no more yelling across the house). I will be adding the cable to connect the living room dot with our surround sound so that we can use it that way. And we have added the Harmony skill allowing me to change channels without the remote turning on and off the entire system. New skills are added all the time and my kids and company love to playaround with asking it all kinds of questions. I've even bought one with a Hue bridge set up for my parents. My dad (who hates electronics) love the fact that they no longer have to remember to write down their shopping list and loves controlling the porch lights from his couch.Having so many we have had a few cases of which dot is listening. My boy's solved their issue by calling theirs ""Echo"" while the other rooms near them are ""Amazon"" that helped out a lot. I've stood in the door way between our Kitchen and our living room and both listen when I wake it but only one of them actually follows through with the ask. Like everyone we still have issues with it doing what we want it to do. I continually open the app and review the ""cards"" telling them when they didn't listen right. Our Living room dot tends to turn on all the time, even when I don't think anything like Dot has been said, but I know this is a product of the TV being in the same room so it doesn't bother me too much. I have voice trained each dot at least once, a key here is to use your normal tone of voice so that you are later your not yelling at it. There is also a hidden part of the app under settings then history where it tracks the wake word then the action and you can further tell it if it either responded to a bad wake word or did not do as you ask. The more you work with the device the better it becomes.",0.7,"positive"
4,"Brian","November 1, 2016","I am an Echo owner and bought the dot in order to not only expand Alexa's coverage area, but mainly to take advantage of the audio-out jack feature that is absent on the Echo.  I'm not going to fill this review with everything I like about these units; instead, I'm going to zero in on the one (in my opinion) major flaw of the Dot that caused me to knock off a star in an otherwise 5-star product.The main reason for me wanting the Dot was due to the audio-out jack which would allow me to attach the device to my whole-house audio system and pump the audio output into multiple rooms in the house.  The problem lies in the fact that once something is plugged into the audio jack of the Dot, the built-in speaker no longer functions at all.There are two problems with this situation. One is that if I don't have the audio system turned on in the room with the Dot, I cannot hear any responses from Alexa, since she talks via the audio jack only.  (This is especially a problem to me, since I use Alexa to turn on that same audio system.)  The other problem is that, if someone is listening to the music that is streaming from the Dot in another room, they will be interrupted with Alexa's responses anytime someone talks to her in the main room.  The latter is not that big of a deal, and actually may be useful in some situations; however, the former is a deal-breaker.What I would like to see is that, when something is plugged into the audio jack, only streamed music is fed to that device, while feedback from Alexa remains to be played via the built-in speaker.  Of course, not everyone would want it this way, so this would need to be a user adjustable setting in the Alexa app.  Another setting would be to chose whether Alexa feedback plays via just the internal speaker, or to the audio jack also.I'm not sure how the jack is wired internally -- I fear that the disconnection from the internal speaker might be a hard connections within the jack itself (as opposed to software directing the output to the separate sound devices; internal speaker, or audio jack).  If it is not switched via the hardware, then this could easily be just a firmware update, so I'm not giving up hope just yet.Hopefully Amazon sees this reviews and considers this change in further hardware/software updates of the Dot.  I am guessing there are many others out there like me, for whatever reason, that would welcome these options.  If you do share my view on this feature, please add a comment and/or like this review -- maybe that will bring enough attention to get this into the hands of Amazon's R&D department.",0.5,"netural"
5,"Devlin Jay","October 24, 2016","If you are not familiar with an Amazon Echo or Amazon Echo Dot, all I can say is that there is never a better time than now to get some experience with it.This new generation of Echo Dot is not only cheaper (50% of the first generation cost) and it is improved upon by the spatial recognition that was implemented. Also, they are continuously updating and improving the experience with “Alexa”.If you are curious about Alexa versus Siri, if you ask Alexa she will say “Not saying I am better, just different” or something along those lines. This is honestly one of THE best ways to describe “her”. I like Siri a lot and I really like Alexa as they both are part and parcel to a whole new type of experience in today’s technological era.Siri is better for some off-the-cuff type questions and such whereas Alexa can turn on, off, dim or brighten your lights (the ones that are compatible; which is  increasing and while a little expensive, worth it in my humble opinion). There will be a lot of times when you ask Alexa a question and she does not know the answer but over time that I have owned my Echo, it has improved and more and more phrases are recognized.Curious about the weather, ask. Curious about traffic, scores for sports or even when the next Presidential Debate (if there was another one), just ask Alexa. She will tell you when your favorite sports team plays, order pizza or an Uber and so, so, so much more!As many have mentioned, the speaker on this Echo Dot are not nearly as good as a full-sized Echo but you have an explicit advantage with an Echo Dot in that you can connect it to your sound system, home theater system or any other speakers you like and love to get the sound you want. The full Echo has a speaker that I enjoy but I think it is wonderful that you can hook this up to your sound system.The inexpensive cost of this cannot be underscored enough…BUT…it seems it can be a slippery slope as I have decided to purchase more and more items that are compatible with Alexa and now also adding a Wink Hub to open up a much larger ecosystem (echo-system?) ' . I’ve also purchased a Philips Hue Color starter kit and implemented those in the living room. When we turn on and off lights or dim them, we ask Alexa to assist and in most cases, it works very well. It works a WHOLE lot more now that I have one full-sized Echo and 2 Echo Dots (2nd generation).As a side note, the new Prime music is awesome and inexpensive if you own an Echo but it is only good on ONE Echo so you will not have access to it on all 3 or 4 if you own multiple ones.Absolutely 100% recommended. If you do not like it, you can probably sell it for a good price or always return it.________________What I recommend_________________If you have any interest in home automation, check out the Wink or Smart Things hubs. The Wink hub can be had for around $60 at the moment and it opens up SO many possibilities concerning types of lights, locks, cameras, smoke detectors, powered blinds, crock pots (yes, they have a ""smart crock pot"" and a ""smart coffee maker"") as well as too many other things to mention.Here are my favorite accessories with Alexa (Echo Dot):Wink Hub (have not tried Smart Things)Cree Connected Bulbs (you need Wink to use these)Philips Hue (do not need Wink for this but the Hue products are expensive)GE Quirky or GE Link lights (Believe you need Wink for these)I really cannot underscore how much I love asking Alexa what time it is when I am trying to set the time on a wall clock because the battery died and I cannot find my smart phone. I also love the reminders, timers and Prime music.There are so many intricacies with the entire Alexa platform and Amazon has done a really good job in improving and evolving things.So happy I took the plunge with a refurbished Echo to start. I was so worried I would not have a use for it but it ended up being something I love and have faith in. Since the new generation is so inexpensive (Echo Dot), I am seriously considering getting one for a family member that is so incredibly hard to shop for...also one for my office...I love listening to audio books when I work and the Echo (Dot as well) can read your Kindle books (most of them) if you ask ""Please read my book (Insert book title here)"". Sometimes it is quirky but it usually does pretty good. It can be a nice way to save some money instead of buying an audio book.Final thought: The speaker on these are just alright...I think they are better relegated to the bedroom or kitchen and a full-sized Echo in the living room or den...unless you hook this up to a sound system or Bluetooth speaker.Absolutely 100% recommended",0.888888888888889,"positive"

The voice recognition is outstanding, setup was fairly easy and it works great. My favorite features are the timer, weather and calendar. In the mornings, I can get all I need in minutes while packing lunches. We have a bluetooth speaker that we love and has awesome quality so when listening to music, we just switch that on to compensate for the small speakers.Don't teach your child/children how to access the fart jokes or noises. It will drive you nuts. Since they are mostly technology smarter than us adults, they will probably figure it out anyway!The one thing I would love to see the Echo Dot/Echo do is be able to voice activate emergency/911 and be able to transmit the address.

This is going to be a bit of a tough review for me, kind of like a date that you WANT to really work out, but...I love gadgets that help me answer little questions, like Google does.  I was very excited to get Alexa because I am always using my phone to search for small bits of info everyday and to think I could simply ask it without typing and from my favorite sitting area!  I was very willing to fall in love with Alexa before I even met her...First, I like the white because I am an Apple fan and it looks good sitting on the table.  Now for the pros and cons.Alexa has me listening to more music than I have in a long time, because it is simple to just ask her to play something I like from Amazon or my Amazon play list.  She also plays my favorite radio station as long as you include the full name of the station.  Connecting to Bluetooth, is a challenge though.  I have a ton of Bluetooth speakers that work for everything else, but Alexa does not want to connect easily or does not stay connected.  For me, this is not a big problem as I can simply use a plug in cable to connect her, but she is supposed to work wirelessly.You know when you meet a girl, you want to be able to have a good conversation, I thought that Alexa and I would get along great in that area, but not so much.  Alexa's personality is a bit dry to say the least.  Even Siri has a sense of humor for the most part, but Alexa simply wants to answer questions on a bit of the matter of fact side.  She also does not seem to know much about a lot of things, I was surprised by this.  I am hoping Amazon adds a bit of personality to her and uses a better database for her information, maybe use Google?  She can access Google calendar, but not the one I use on my iPhone.  Too bad as that would be really helpful, but good if you use Google.  Please do not ask her a joke, you will be  sorry...Alexa can order from Amazon, but I have not figured out how to get her to order what is not on her pre-made lists.  Like being able to just ask for a product by name.  Sometimes, Alexa does not want to listen to me when I tell her to quit things, I have had girlfriends like this before, but it can be annoying when you want the music off and she wants to keep jamming...I had to send my other Alexa back and I hope the new one will be a bit better as far as connecting and such...  Much like a relationship.  I am hoping over time that Alexa and I can get to know each other better.  I will learn how to understand her limitations better and she will grow and learn how to help me with my needs a bit more.  Time will tell, but she is a cheap date and she is awful cute as well.  I think we can grow together with the help of Amazon and maybe have better communication someday, at least till a new and better Alexa comes along... ;-)  I do not want to bash her to much, because for the money, she is a fun, but limited kind of friend that does make life a bit more enjoyable, just do not expect too much from her...",0.772727272727273,"positive"

I go to the Alexa app and the card is right there.Other things that have happened -- it won't listen/doesn't hear me when I tell it to stop playing something. I have to get up, walk over to and it yell at it several times. This seems to be S.O.P. for mine. Lots of other similar comments for the Dot.It randomly started babbling incomprehensible stuff once around midnight. I wasn't asleep yet but it would have totally freaked me out if I had been.It frequently doesn't understand what I've asked. Example - it doesn't get the name of a song I ask it to play. It'll respond with things like ""I can't find a song with those lyrics."" It's not a lyric, it's the exact song title -- with artist, and I've checked and it's available in Prime music. So then I ask it to play the album and it gives me ""XX Radio,"" not the album. Or starts telling me what else I might be interested in. I know what I'm ""interested in."" I asked for it. I didn't get it.It's a nice hands-free music device when it works and that's about all I use it for. About 1/3 of the time it's about as smart as a hockey puck. I reset it.

Cool.- If you plan to use the audio output jack, make absolutely sure that you use a quality USB power source. I made the mistake of using a spare USB port from a nearby router and got all kinds of noise and interference. When I switched back to using the supplied adapter, the output was clean and quiet.- Here is how I use one of my echos (oh yes, I have more than one: both were gifts) to switch between multiple outputs(1) I use two Bluetooth speakers. The primary one (Bose) is listed first, and will be chosen by default when you say ""Alexa Connect""(2) I use the audio output jack for my home theater, and it plays automatically when I say ""Alexa Disconnect""(3) The second Bluetooth plays whenever I turn off my little Bose speaker and then say ""Alexa Connect"".So, while you don't get them playing all at once, I can easily select to play to 3 different speakers without messing with the APP.Finally, I like to walk around with my echo sometimes, so I use USB chargers.Here are two I like (I included pictures):Looks way cool: New Design Portable Power Bank, Vivis Pi Ultra Slim 6000mAh Fashion Facial massager 2-Port Fast Portable Charger External Battery Pack Backup Charger with Makeup Mirror for iPhone 6, 6 plus, iPad Air 2 Mini 3, Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 Edge and More (Black)Fits in a pocket: Smartwatch Charger (White) - Portable 2 x AA USB Charger with Built-n Light",0.714285714285714,"positive"

I have also played with many voice features such as news and weather reports but realize that I have not even scratched the surface of the echo dot's capabilities.

5,"KiwiMaster","November 6, 2016","This is one of 5 ""Alexa"" devices I'm using. I started with the Echo, got a Dot, then a Tap and another 2 Dots.Set up was the same quick process.This 2nd gen Dot is better at picking us up even though it's next to a television. The first gen was not very good at discerning between us and it.I did briefly worry about the commercials where they say ""Alexa, get me an Uber"". I was waiting to see if the TV ordered one. It seems it did not. Interesting idea though. Thousands of pizza delivered.  Or laundry detergents reordered.I like the white Dot a bit better as well. Nice to have options. The fabric covers sort of make that a non-issue of course unless like me you prefer the smooth surface.It also came with the ESP (Echo Spatial Perception) installed. Admittedly the other devices soon upgraded themselves as well.This works very well. Only one ""Alexa"" handles any given request.I did note that the new Dots are very aggressive about this. Even when physically closer to the Echo upstairs the downstairs (entryway) Dot quite often takes the request.The speakers on these little guys is remarkably good. I have yet to plug in any of my external speakers.",0.882352941176471,"positive"
3,"Cade Lusk","January 31, 2017","While I don't use this product as often as I'd like, I'm really impressed with the Echo Dot. It does what its advertised as doing, and its a really inexpensive alternative to the most popular in home AI. However, there are some serious areas that need improving for me to be using this everyday like I imagined.The sound is a lot clearer and louder than I would have expected from the Dot. While I don't own the original Echo, I do own several speakers of similar size that cost double what the dot costs, and the sound is greater than half of the quality. Not a whole lot of graininess or anything particularly bad to speak of. Now, you're not going to get surround sound quality out of it, but it gets the job done.Setup was a breeze. The included instructions could be followed by a child, and the whole process took about ten minutes. The hardest thing was connecting to my WiFi, and even that was just a matter of downloading the app.Functionally, this product is everything you'd expect. Its a responsive AI that answers questions and interacts with (some) other apps to do cool things like turn on the lights or play your favorite news. One thing to mention here is that Alexa (I had to change the wake-word to ""echo"", Alexa is a family member's name) will just search for universal sources to do these things unless you specify otherwise (looking at TuneIn for news radio, Amazon Music for all music requests, etc). Sometimes that can be a pain, but most of the time its right on.The ""Skills"" store is pretty flush with cool skills to ""teach"" Alexa. While I understand that there is a lot of integration with the rest of the tech community, I was a little disappointed to not see more integration with the apps I have on my (android) phone. That's always been a little bit of a short-coming with Amazon though, because they always seem to truly be the less popular Third Party in the app space.There were a couple of things that I wish someone had thought to include in this generation.First, you cannot control your dot through separate accounts. For example, me and my Fiance share the device at home, but we don't have just one account for the house. She has to sign in under my name in order to use the app to change settings or add skills.Second, its really, really, REALLY inconvenient that this unit has to ALWAYS be plugged in. I understand there are some battery attachments that you can buy... but seriously. This seems like a wrong move from Amazon. The small size insinuates an ease of movement. If I go from my kitchen to my bathroom, I just want to continue hearing whatever I was listening to. Maybe I want to move the unit into the bedroom without killing the power. Either way, this seems like step back in time to an era where everything electronic needed to have disposable batteries or had to be plugged in.Last, the voice recognition over its own volume. The Echo is advertised as having many directional microphones that are supposed to make it able to hear you from any direction and over noise. However, my experience has been mixed. If I need to communicate with the Echo while its playing, say, the news - I have to SHOUT over it to get my message across. To top that, there's a microphone ""remote"" you can buy for it but no in app functionality for the microphone I carry everywhere - my phone. Again, you can't control this thing via voice commands from your phone. Huge oversight that's probably intentional to get you to buy the remote.This is a great little gadget that has a TON of potential. I still love using mine when I do, and I think it will be a lot nicer once I get my Smart Home setup going. However, there are still a lot of areas of improvement that I really don't see as being all that difficult to implement. 3/5, I would recommend, just not strongly at this point.",0.722222222222222,"positive"

I am floored at the complexity yet usability of this thing. And was totally shocked on how decent it sounded. No it is not going to rattle the windows but I really expected it to be unusable for background music. It really has a decent sound so will not be adding speakers to it. I am just learning how to connect to a few gadgets and the vocabulary will take a little more work. But I really am impressed. Out of the many gadgets I have purchased - this one is staying put!

5,"azjmw","October 24, 2016","LOVE IT! The Dot is certainly strong enough to stand on its own if you don't have an Echo, but if you can, I still recommend spending the extra for the Echo. That being said, the experience is largely the same with the Dot. Where it really shines is as a secondary/tertiary/etc unit throughout the house e.g. in bedrooms where you might already have a TV soundbar to connect to or in a den/office where you have different sound needs or existing speakers. The really cool feature that makes multi units practical is the Echo Spatial Perception that ensures the unit that picks you up the best when you speak is the one that responds. True, it's not a seamless network of devices, it's really a set of independent devices providing the appearance of a more or less homogenous environment. There is a ways to go in functionality (i.e. being able to start a playlist or command or whatever in one room on one device and have it continue or be redirected to another device in another room), but this is a great start and an awesome way to have Alexa everywhere you need her",1,"positive"
4,"pwc","October 29, 2016","Warning: using a speaker jack mutes the Dot itself, so stereo must be powered on to hear Alexa. Also, to play iTunes using voice commands, songs must be uploaded to Amazon Music (free for 250 songs). Of course, Alexa remains fully operational with bluetooth speakers, and iTunes will play using the iPhone instead of voice control. So far, the Dot only has a female voice and no other option. Otherwise, after only one day, it seems cool.",0.666666666666667,"positive"

1,"Matt Kraus","November 3, 2016","In truth, I love the idea behind this, but the technology just isn't there yet.  I need one system to integrate and glue my home together.  The Amazon Echo system provides a hub in each room, but they're not sync'd together.  While the Dots do operate from a centralized app, they don't talk to each other.  The biggest way this plays out for me is that I can't actively stream music across my home.  Instead, I'd need to start music on each Dot, and they'll never be in time, and likely be playing a different song all together.  I was ready to buy 10 of these, but am likely going to stick to just one.  PLEASE FIX THIS AMAZON [and conquer the world].",1,"positive"

I can't get the Dot to change the color of the lights, only on, off, and %.What I'd really love to see would be a device that combines the always on voice control of the Dot with a Fire TV.

So convenient to walk into a room and say ""play whatever you want to hear"" and say ""what volume level you want"".  The To-Do and Grocery List is a huge plus, whenever you think of something just say it and it goes on your list, if you're not home and the wife or kids need something they can just tell Alexa and it gets on your list.

4,"EMOlson","November 12, 2016","My big problem with the Echo was that there was no way to connect to SONOS.  (I took off two stars for that.)The new DOT has the same issue, but I am only taking off one star.  The reason for that being when you Jerry-rig a connection using a BT reciever you loose the Echo or Dot speaker, which is a bigger deal for the Echo because you have paid $120 more for that speaker.So you can Jerry-rig a connection...  You have to buy a Bluetooth receiver, pair it to the Dot, connect it to the line-in on a Sonos Play, and then swithc your Sonos to ""line-in"".  Problem solved? ....Well, ""Yes"" and ""No""!There are still two major problems.  The first is that linking other Sonos zones doesn't work that well (Sonos is great but not designed for live streaming).  Which leads to the second issue (which is a minus 1 star for DOT); if one wants to hear Sonos in multiple rooms you have to link your zone to another input or zone (bypassing the DOT).  The problem here is that the DOT is still sending it's sound to the Play unit which is no longer listening.  Your Alexa is mute when connected to BT!The easy solution is to tell Alexa ""disconnect bluetooth""...  the problem is that the DOT immediately reconnects to bluetooth because BT receiver's are designed to auto-reconnect to previously paired devices.  This means you have to either ""forget"" the connection or unplug the BT receiver...... What a pain!TO THE DOT ENGINEERING TEAM: come on guys, you are getting so close!  First and best solution: GIVE US A SONOS SKILL.  I""LL GIVE YOU SIX STARS....  Short of that us a firmware upgrade for both Echo and Dot that allows us 1) the option to keep the speaker on when paired to BT and 2) to completely control DOT's BT by voice.... Disable the auto-reconnect feature in the DOT, it is not needed.  Do that and I will change to five stars.",0.470588235294118,"negative"

Yes, beyond specs!Design - the simple LED lit hockey disk look good in most settings.Endelsss Fount Of Knowledge - now it's as simple as ""Alexa, wiki electoral college.""  ""Alexa, weather.""  etc. etc.Best DJ Ever - Ever sit around with friends listening to music and say, ""Remember that song?"", but you couldn't really be bothered to get up because you were kind of inebriated.

It even understands my slurred speech!Oh, and it comes with a bartender recipe tool! (note:Mixing of drinks, still requires getting up.)  Alexa has many skill sets along with cooking recipes too.  Feeling down?  Just tell her to play you some comedy.  It's the ultimate whim machine!CONS:Minimal speaker - I pair a high quality battery operated blue tooth or my headphone for a hifi experience.  The quality is then excellent!Should have a cordless option - like an optional disc it sits on that's rechargeable for hours of cordless use.  This would be a HUGE improvement to go with the waterproof release.One Voice - I think it could have more than one voice, I'm sure many would appreciate a Stephen Hawkings option or whatever.  That option wouldn't even require a visit to the recording studio.SUMMARY:For $50 I get a dumb version of HAL from the movie ""2001"".  I'm living in the future!  I think I'll get some Echo controlled outlets next!NOTE: I used the computer registration page at alexa.amazon.com from my laptop.  The instructions tell you connect to Echo Dot's amazon-xxx network that should show up in the available wifi networks.  It didn't show up or would pop in and out.  Not until I disconnected my laptop from my home network did I see the availability of the amazon-xxx network.  After that, it was easy.

I like that my music was assessable automatically.  I didn't have to do a thing.  I was pleased to see it will read out loud a lot of my kindle books.  I live in a small apartment so the ""turn the lights on"" won't work but it does so much else.  Set up was really easy and to use.  Got a good chuckle when my neighbor walked in and told it to play an Elvis song.  She's in love with it now too.  It's louder than I thought it would be and works well.  If they put these back on sale I'll be buying at least one more for the bedroom.  I love the ease of being able to set alarms and get the time of day.  I did have to call the help desk as I had a small problem setting it up.  Apparently Alexa won't respond if you put an ""s"" on the end of her name.  Once I stopped doing that she has been great.  Only two things I would change....  1. be able to change the start up name to anything I want and 2. enable her to read documents that I have on my Kindle as well as the books as a lot of my fan fiction I have loaded are in doc format.  Maybe someday they will enable that.  Update:  I found my bluetooth speaker and set it up.  Now only need one so won't be buying a second one unless it's for a gift.

Over time we found that we used it less and less unless we were in the room she was in.  Now comes the Echo Dot!  It's very resonably priced and has definitely extended the usability of the Alexa cloud service.  We now have one in the bedroom and plan on getting at least two more.  Now she turns off the lights at bedtime, sets the Ecobee thermostat  to our night time temp and even wakes us up in the morning.  She tells me whats on my calendar for the day and gives me the news and weather while I get ready every morning.  Since I have had the Echo for a while I can attest to the fact that she gets smarter every week and you get a weekly email informing you of some of the things she has learned over the past week.  The Alexa Cloud service also bridges the gap between Apple HomeKit and Google Home working with all the latest and major brands available.

2,"Amazon Customer","November 28, 2016","Cons - I am getting a lot of 'sorry i couldnt get this' type responses from Alexa. Also the wake names of 'Echo' and 'Amazon' do not work as well as 'Alexa' wake command.But the most disappointing part is it is not accepting any music commands like 'Alexa play some soft music' or even the ones advertised like 'Alexa play 80s music' etc.Also i would like to get teh weather in celsius but no matter what i ask for what is current weather in celsius, it still follows the farenheit way.On the pros side, the sound quality and audio is decent, acts as a good speaker. THe bluetooth connection with my phone worked well. It will give you back all the standard questions but do not expect intelligent linkages to previous queries and you would have to repeat things if you need to ask a follow on question.",0.8,"positive"

4,"Roger M.","October 24, 2016","I've had an Echo in the kitchen for a few months and I really like it, so I decided to get an Echo Dot for the bedroom. If not for the lower sound quality (as expected), it works ALMOST as well. I say ALMOST because it seems to have a bit of trouble hearing me - even though I'm closer to the device and it's quieter in the bedroom than the kitchen. Unfortunately, both devices are ""hard of hearing"" when music is playing or an alarm is sounding and I have to raise my voice. The Echo Dot, in particular, seems worse in this regard.UPDATE 12/25/16: I ended up returning the Echo Dot and buying another one at a later date. The second one seems to not only have better sound quality, but it has better ""hearing"" as well. I'm not sure if the improvement was due to software updates since then or if I simply had a ""slightly defective"" device. Either way, I've increased my rating from 3 stars to 4 stars.",0.571428571428571,"positive"
3,"Chris","January 11, 2017","Still needs A LOT of work vut here's my opinion so far;PROS:• Great music player. I would argue it's the best feature, the Echo is excellent at pulling up music, sports, and radio stations.• News briefing. You can build your own custom news briefing from just about every news source, even stack news sources for multiple briefings.• Audio out port. The dot has an audio out port so you can hook up an external speaker or a set of bluetooth speakers through bluetooth.• Basic Q&A. Alexa is good a VERY, VERY basic Q&A. Alexa's data comes from Bing.com, so when you ask a question that Bing.com doesn't answer, and Bing hardly answers anything more complicated than 'Who was the 40th president?'. The biggest failure of this product, to me, was to put so much faith behind Bing.CONS:• The 'awesome' far field mics aren't that awesome. You have to speak like a robot for it to perfectly understand you. Otherwise, you could be getting the weather in London when you don't care.• Advanced Q&A terrible. Getting ready for heavy doses of 'Sorry. I don't know the answer."" Like I said, Bing isn't Google and needs a major overhaul.• SKILLS, or lack thereof. This part of the Echo family I hate the most. If you've ever owned a Pebble smartwatch, you already have plenty of experience with this silly concept. Basically, you can download 'skills' which are apps that can be triggered by a VERY SPECIFIC phrase to utilize different companies' Echo app. For example, the commercial of people ordering a Pizza on Alexa he says 'tell Dominos' to trigger the Dominos app or skill. Most apps, or skills, that are available don't work well and require an often hard to remember or grammatically incorrect phrase to trigger the apps, which are either severly limited or weren't worth the download. Music is the only skill they got right.In summary, this has become a voice activated music library. For that purpose, this thing is awesome and totally worth the $50. However, if I were to grade the music feature with the rest of the Echo's so called features, I wouldn't give it more than 3 stars. It was a giant disappointment for me, as I expected at least Google level answers to my questions and get far from it. The skills are borderline worthless (unless you like meditating and facts about dogs, cats, and celebs). The voice recognition isn't bad but isn't great either.I'll leave it here for now. If updates drastically change the functionality, I'll leave an update.",0.621621621621622,"positive"

I live in a three story home, and have added Dots to each level.Amazon Dots were easy to sync to my wireless and I linked them into my Wink account (or Wink was linked to Amazon app).  I have had no problem in setup, nor does Alexa have difficulty in hearing me.  In fact, when reviewing the video I just created off of my phone, Alexa started to respond to the video audio!On the top floor, I have the Dot as a stand alone and use it for an alarm clock, verbal bedroom thermostat (Nest) adjuster, and 'weather station'. I bicycle commute to work most days, and it is nice to know what to expect outside when I am getting up and getting prepped (ie warmer cycling clothing or cooler needed?).The downstairs Dot is in my office and currently is only answering questions and changing the second floor thermostat which impact temperature on the lower level.The second floor / living room Dot is connected to my Marantz stereo receiver (Monster 3.5mm to RCA cable).  My receiver is not wireless nor does it have Bluetooth. The Dot plays music through my receiver with decent/good sound quality. It also can turn on and off an automated outlet that is connecting a lamp in the living room.The Dots do not currently see nor control my automated front door lock or garage door, though Wink does.I have uploaded a short video that shows some of the automation in my living room being controlled by Alexa and Wink.  Sound quality in this video is not that decent; it was captured off my phone.  Don't mind the mini-tour, or my fur-balls.

4,"Donald Sensing","November 20, 2016","I got this on something of a lark. My son has the $179 regular Echo and when I visited him it seemed intriguing - but not enough to spend 179 bucks on. So I pre-ordered the Dot when it was announced.Basically, this is a talking toy. I do find it convenient, though not essential, for checking my calendar or the latest news shorts or getting a quick weather forecast. It also tells really lousy jokes and is handy for a countdown timer or an alarm. But I do not really get a lot of utility out of it -- mainly because I am not willing to lay out the major coin it would take to make it the controller of a smart house. The hardware for that ain't cheap, sports fans.So I give it four stars for doing what it's advertised to do but for my personal usefulness I'd give it only one or two. If you are willing to spend lots of money for smart devices, you'll probably like it a lot. I think.Now for the Alexa smart phone app (I use Android). It's used for setup and once you're done with that, it's mostly a tutorial. There are a fair number of ""skills"" you can activate on the app for the Dot, but most won't be useful to you or any other individual user. What you cannot do with the app do is use it away from home as a voice-responsive Alexa app. So away from home I use the MS Cortana app. Or the Google app. How awkward is that? So Amazon, get Alexa on the smart phone app already. But of course, if you did that, why would you need to sell the hardware?And that, IMO, is the conundrum: it's a software, cloud-driven piece of hardware that does not really require the hardware.",0.764705882352941,"positive"

5,"BuyItOnce","November 3, 2016","The first Echo system seemed like an expensive toy and questionably expensive for just another music speaker. All that has changed in pretty much the span of a year; Alexa skills have grown quite a bit to control other services and hardware, and the echo hardware costs have come down significantly with the 2nd gen Dot.Seems like the Echo is ready for prime time mass adoption with a maturing eco system, and this is when I decided to try it out. By itself, the echo service can tell you the weather, news, play music, search the internet, set alarms/timers. Useful, but nothing your phone can't already do via either OK Google or Siri for the most part or a few taps manually. If your habits in these activities are already ingrained, you're not likely to change them to use Echo.The real value and use case winner is in how fast and easy the echo ecosystem integrates with other services and hardware for home automation and control. The Echo ecosystem is vastly easier and cheaper to implement home automation than competing offerings; unless you're already committed to Smarthings, Wink, Iris, etc. and love/able to tinker with z wave or x10. If the hardware of your choice has a mobile app, chances are it's already compatible with Echo or will be since the extent of integration needed is mostly an account linking between the services.So what have I been able to automate for less than $400 total so far?HardwareSensi smart thermostat - set specific temp for each thermostatLogitech Hub-- turn on/off tv or each componentTp Link smart plugs --turn on/off air cleaner, dehumidifier, fan, or space heaterI'm sure there are better Z wave and X10 solutions that can do this too, but each of these only took minimal set up to install and enable.On the services side, being able to integrate with Spotify is amazing. I can rattle off whatever song or playlist I want to hear and it plays from spotify.A typical night in the kitchen now usually involves playing some music from Spotify while cooking, turning on the TV and sound bar, set a higher temp if it's cold. Turn things off again while dinner is being served, turn on space heater or air cleaner as we gradually move upstairs for the night.Just practical voice controlled home automation with minimal investment cost.It's not all perfect though, just because it's easy to link services doesn't mean they always work together flawlessly. There were a few times where Echo acknowledged a music request but nothing played. I've come to learn that Spotify has issues maintaining a long list of Spotify connect devices; some of my devices just drop from their list from time to time. Amazon can't fix this, since it's really a Spotify issue but it does chip away at the overall Echo experience.Logitech integration has worked great so far but Logitech has only invested minimally at this point, I can only turn things on/off, still need the remote or my phone to control volume.The smart plugs work fine with the stock Kasa app but echo has been unable to turn on the fan a few times with no apparent reason why. I can only suspect that there was some problem with the account link in the background.While Echo is quick to connect with these services, it's up to each service owner how well they support functionality and that is likely the biggest catch and watchout for the Echo home automation ecosystem.There's a ton of additional potential for cost effective and easy expansion to include anything that has a Wifi app; lights, door locks, garage doors. But it will all leave a bad taste if the supported functionality is minimal from each vendor.For now, it remains cost effective even for existing functionality and the future is yet bright for more to come.",0.767441860465116,"positive"

5,"NikonCoach","December 1, 2016","There are quite a few 'reviews' of this product here and I waste your waste time repeating what has already been said.I use this well-made product primarily to listen to music played on my mobile device through speakers connected to my old Marantz 8000 audio receiver. This product acts as the bluetooth adapter/bridge between mobile device and AUX input on my stereo. There are other cheaper products that can serve as bluetooth adapters but none as well-built and versatile. I also use it, with voice commands, to play Amazon Prime music on my stereo. Alexa can hear my commands even when the stereo is playing real loud.I haven't used it to control other gizmos in my house...'coz I do not have any such gizmos yet.",0.5,"netural"
3,"Reasonable Reviewer","January 18, 2017","The Echo Dot  seems like a great idea. Theoretically, there are many services that you can activate using your voice alone. In practice, it is mostly a mechanism to encourage further Amazon purchases. I now view Alexa as a surly teenager with a shopping problem. Alexa does not understand half of what I say, and most of the time I cannot get the apps to work.Alexa will often say "" I don't understand that question.""  Alexa will often suggest that you buy something. Let's be honest. Alexa is not designed to be a community service by Amazon. I get it, but there needs to be more functionality added  before this is a must-have item for the home. On the positive side, Alexa will pair with your Bluetooth device. It took me four or five tries, but now I can stream music from another device through Alexa.Also, I found customer service for Alexa to be sorely lacking.There is a lot of potential here, but it has not arrived yet.",0.714285714285714,"positive"
5,"Scarlett_Kat","January 30, 2017","I love my Echo-Dot (2nd Generation). I mainly bought it because I wanted a speaker to listen to music, yet I thought this would be fun to get some other information from as well. As I am getting to know ""Alexa"" I am realizing she has a lot of capabilities to play games like 20 Questions, Rock Paper Scissors, Bingo, Jeopardy 6...among many others. She has a sense of humor. She can give you news and answer questions. She is voice command and has new things Amazon adds all the time. My family really gets a kick out of her. We enjoyed it so much, my son also bought one for his room. The only draw back that I have found so far is that it doesn't have a parent control. But whatever your kids are asking it, does come up on a log so you can see what they are asking. If they say anything inappropriate you should know about it with the Alexa App. It does have an option to turn off purchasing, so your kids aren't ordering things from your account. I have had it for over a month and I am very happy with it.",0.777777777777778,"positive"
5,"Kahlos Mahn","December 29, 2016","I love my Amazon Echo Dot! Got one for Christmas and was so excited to set it up! I have a Magic Home bluetooth lightbulb which works great (3 step process to set it up) easily connected my Spotify account, and added a couple of fun skills (weather, dream-machine noises, comedy central, NPR, horoscope, etc.) and use it everyday! It's most handy when I first wake up and groggily say 'Alexa stop!' and the alarm fades away, then I listen to the weather and get a flash briefing on what's new in the news while I get ready for work, maybe ask her to play a song to pep me up. Then at night I ask her to turn the lights on (though I've noticed a bit of lag from the Magic Home lighbulb, not Echo's fault, it happens with Magic Home Android app too) and am planning on getting another BT lightbulb for my overhead room-light-fixture. Overall this is a great product, the sound quality is great for such a little thing, after doing the initial voice set up, Alexa understands me even when I'm dozing off and slurring my words, asking her to turn the lights off. :)",0.75,"positive"
4,"Jeff","January 9, 2017","LOOOOOOOVE my Dots! I'm really getting used to talking to Alexa, getting helpful information, turning off and on music, lights, etc.I have two desires in order to get to 5 stars:1) Alexa confuses profiles if two Amazon Household members each have separate Amazon Prime accounts. My wife and I have separate Amazon accounts. However, when registered in Alexa as a household, she can't tell one calendar from another. This makes no sense to me, since each registered email address has its own GMail calendar, but according to Amazon Support, Alexa can't distinguish them if we have separate Amazon accounts. The result is she can only read from one calendar, regardless of which profile she's set to. It's a minor annoyance, but makes the calendar connection useless unless we close one of our Amazon accounts.2) Alexa has a bit of trouble distinguishing Smart Home routines. For example, if you have 2 Smart Home routines called ""Enter Bedroom"" and ""Leave Bedroom"", she always has to ask which one you really want, even though ""Enter"" and ""Leave"" sound nothing alike. If you remove the word ""Bedroom"" from both routines, then she's fine, which would be an option if I only had one room in my house!",0.555555555555556,"positive"

As you can see I am a pretty big fan of the echo products.  That said, I was NOT as impressed with the 2nd generation Dot as I was with the original.  First of all, I really liked the ""dial"" for volume. The entire family felt that the dial was much better than the simple buttons -- not as intuitive and as easy to use.  On top of that, it doesn't seem to be as good at understanding everyone in the family (responds to me really well, however my wife and my son -- not so much).  Not sure what happened with the design of this 2nd gen - it just doesn't seem to be as good as the orignal.",1,"positive"
3,"ManoaHI","November 21, 2016","Not overly stunning, but entertaining. Tried the Alexa ""training"" but doesn't do as good a job as Siri, Google Assistant or even Cortana. I will update this review later since I've been using Siri for about 5 years, since it was released, and Google Assistant (and it's predecessor Google Now) for 3 years and Cortana for just over a year. So, Alexa may need some more time to get used to my voice, since it is just about 1 week. I have yet to connect it to any Wemo device.If anyone knows how to get it to get ""trained"" faster, I'd like to know how. My test case has always been to get NFL scores. Right now Alexa doesn't understand ""What is the score of Thursday Night Football?""This is my initial impression, this may change overt time. I would still recommend this since it is relatively inexpensive.",1,"positive"

I still have a lot to learn about all I can do with it, but set-up was very easy, and functionally, I don't know how it could get any better. I like the news briefing, and the fact that you can choose your own news source.  The sound is amazing, and I don't have it connected to speakers.With our large family here on Christmas eve, we could hear Christmas music playing over the din of voices...many kids included.I don't bother checking the weather on my smartphone anymore...Alexa gives me current temperature plus the days forecast instantly.It is an amazing device I didn't know I needed or wanted, and when I saw the promotion price, I decided to try it out... what a great deal!One of my kids got me the remote for Christmas, and although I haven't used it yet, I am expecting it be a valuable addition to the Dot.Thanks again Amazon, you rock!!",0.8,"positive"
4,"Joshua","November 21, 2016","Setup was easy and straightforward. Great to be able to use voice commands for lights. It would be helpful to be able to say ""Turn off all of the kitchen lights"" without having to create a group/room called ""All of the Kitchen Lights.""Customization of the activation/trigger word is a must. Shouldn't have to choose from the three offered. (I'm pretty tired of the thing activating every time there's a Lexus ad on TV.)The voice recognition at one moment shocks me with its accuracy, and at other times seems to hear something that is almost entirely unlike what was actually said.There's no ability to play the same song/playlist/news on all Echo's simultaneously in the house. So if you're doing something that involves going from room to room, you're out of luck.Checking for and updating the firmware should be one of the voice commands the Echo recognizes. It should also be able to identify itself to make setting multiple Echos up on a network easier.I anticipate that many of these functional limitations will be addressed with firmware updates.",0.714285714285714,"positive"

I find from time to time that I use the word Amazon in my conversations and I see it light up, kind of funny. I have not done much else with it yet other than ask it to play Christmas music and seeing as I have not setup Pandora or any other music I assume it defaults to Amazon prime music which is pretty nice. I have a couple Blink cameras and plan to set them up next. I also have a Vera home automation system that pretty much runs itself but from time to time when I have to enable it etc. and would be nice to have voice commands instead of getting my phone out, logging into the app and making the change. I bought the Echo Dot so I could use it with my whole house speakers but have not been able to find a way to hook up the 3.5mm external speaker jack to my four banana plugs that control my four rooms.

5,"the Fat Man","February 26, 2017","You are my everything.Seriously she does it all. My curiosity peaks at random intervals of any day and she answers them. I enjoy the trivia, jokes, weather input so I can dress accordingly and check my commute before heading out. The top features I've been reliant on is her alarm/timer, ambient noise (paired through my Polk system is awesome), and the more practical use is linking to smart plugs so when I come in with more bags than I should be handling at once I can just tell her to turn on the floor lamp. *click* ""Okay"".I can sleep with ease knowing I can wake up to one of many alarms (most are pleasant, avoid the Celebrity ones) instead of an annoying buzzing or ringing. Skills allow lullaby for kids, read books, or like I mentioned earlier ~ rain, thunderstorm, ocean waves, etc. Not much is wrong with the unit except a pending Bluetooth issue which is at the time of this review post is being looked into by Alexa support. Just about anyone outside can scan for her and play their (tasteless) music through the unit and may startle you but a solution is pending. That's another thing I'd like to mention: the supporting staff are responsive within a few hours, not days. They're very professional yet casual in their messages when covering all points. It's nice to see so many products coming out (eBay has more skins!) to accessorize with but at her low-profile size and color she's fine as-is. I bought the black which is appropriate with my mancave theme: black/white with splashes of blue here and there as is the glow of her ring unless she's having an error (red) or in setup/powering on (purple and orange).We will never argue.

My own songs, nope it will say here's a sample of that song.  Try having it look things up, what a joke.  It will tell you the weather and give you a short NPR overview of the news.  It simply sucks.  I wasted money buying this for myself and as a present.  It's one sorry joke of a mentally challenged AI that should not have been released.I can easily go on youtube on my computer and listen to just about anything I can think of and broadcast it out to my bluetooth speakers.

I put my two extras in the kitchen (because I got tired of telling Alexa my shopping list from afar) and put the other in my bedroom.  You do not need an alarm clock, timer for cooking, perfect for weather reports and traffic reports, check my calendar for the day, set appointments for the coming week, local and national news, sports game times and scores.

They love the idea of asking Alexa to tell a joke, give them a weather report, and most importantly to play their favorite songs. We have linked the Echo Dot to Spotify and Pandora, along with Amazon music and they can find all their songs in an instant. It is especially nice for my daughter who is in 2nd grade and isn't quite at the point of being able to search online for songs herself. She can just ask Alexa to find a song and she is surprisingly accurate.

4,"AmazonShopper","December 26, 2016","We bought this as a present for Christmas. It's just the smaller version of the Echo. It does all the same stuff, it just doesn't have the big speaker in the middle. This one is made more for attaching to external speakers or a sound system. We were worried that this meant it wouldn't have a lot of volume, but this one is not bad at all. We can easily hear it from across the room. There are a few things we didn't like about it, but we only took 1 star off for that.PROS:1. It can control many different ""smart"" devices in your house.2. The speaker on this smaller ""dot"" version is actually pretty good for its size. No complaints about that. We could hear it and it could hear us from across a large room. And supposedly you can hook it up by Bluetooth to another speaker if needed.3. Alexa rarely had trouble understanding us when we spoke to it. It has been understanding close to 90% of what we ask so far. That's pretty good for an AI system.4. The size is very small, which makes it easy to put in areas of the house. We bought the black one so it also hides really well if put on a side table.5. The Alexa App (more on this below in con section) has TONS of ""skills"" you can add to Alexa. For example, right out of the box, when we asked it for ""news"" it would give us the national news from NPR. But if you go into the Alexa app you can change where it pulls the news from, so we searched through the ""skills"" (which are kinda like apps) and found one of our local news stations. So now when we say ""news"", Alexa will read us news from our local station. It looks like there are ""thousands"" of these skills you can add to make it more fun to use.CONS:1. The Alexa App (yes, this is also on the cons list). If you look at the apple app store you'll see the Alexa app has TERRIBLE ratings. It says the app is really slow. We haven't had that problem yet, but we have had the problem of the app not being designed very well. It's not very intuitive, and could be made to function a little better. It's easy to put up with, but it would be nice if the app was easier to understand.2. Alexa actually RECORDS everything you ask it. It keeps the text of what you ask, but it also actually keeps the audio recording of what you asked it. It's not easy to find, but in the app there is a place where you can find a list of everything Alexa has heard, and it will play back an audio recording of your voice asking each question. For privacy concerns, I'm not really happy about that. The product info says it does that so that Alexa can learn from you, but I don't see why it needs to keep an actual audio recording of all that information. Especially not in a way that can be accessed through the app. I understand you have to give up some privacy for the convenience, but recording audio in the background without most users knowing it seems a little bit over the top. To clarify, it only records what you say after you say the wake word ""Alexa"".3. It would be great if there was a way to make this product wireless (so you didn't have to plug it into the wall) but because it's on all the time, it would probably run the batteries down too fast. So just make sure you have a place where you want to put it that has an open outlet nearby.",0.705882352941177,"positive"

Its ability to recognize being called (""Alexa!"") is wonderful, especially when a roomful of conversations are in progress. The price is to kill for and the technology packed into it is phenomenal.

Most of the time she talks we weren't even talking.  Maybe we aren't maximizing her features but other than getting the weather report or the headline news I haven't seen too much value.  We did buy the light kits that work with Alexa but the brand just couldn't keep connected to our internet so we had to return them.  When they were working we found the light feature handy, but when Alexia isn't connected to anything, she's just another gadget I don't need on my counter.  Until she can cook dinner for me, she's really not that useful in my eyes... but she does talk to my husband, tell him jokes, and answers his questions, so maybe she'll grow on me.",0.8,"positive"

I have made ""to do"" lists, ""shopping"" lists, and I stream radio through it - much easier than setting up my laptop to find a station.  I also like to tell her to go to my Pandora account to play my songs and playlists - really cool.  I tell her to raise or lower the volume when I'm listening to radio sometimes, or I just yell, ""Alexa, stop!"" when I want her off and the tv on - without getting up from my chair..  I want to order a second Echo so I can have one in both bedrooms.  Right now, I just move the unit to different rooms, but that's getting old.  Having one in both bedrooms and one in the great room would be perfect.  I will soon.",1,"positive"

1,"Sego","January 21, 2017","Alexa is a really great timer & weather informant. But that's about it. I'm very disappointed in this. In order to find out information like ""How much is half of 1 1/2 cup"" for a recipe or ""what is an alternative for baking soda"" or other basic questions you have to download apps. Then you have to remember the name of the associated app with your question. (IE: Alexa, ask 'The Happy Chef' what half of 1 1/2 cup is' etc. Everything you want to ask it has a different associated app and I don't have time to remember that many apps. I use Alexa as a glorified timer and end up Googling everything else.  I will be getting the Google version of Alexa that will let me ask pretty much whatever I want without additional apps.",0.8,"positive"

Can't sync up with my bluetooth speaker. I have a JBL flip I suppose it's one of the popular bluetooth speaker on the market.. The phone apps of Alexa is pretty lame, hard to use, bad GUI (in term of font and picture plus menu layout) , very slow. The main issue is it can't correctly recognize my voice control. Most of time very slow and if you are like 4 feet away or playing music you need to short. In general the response time is very slow, Alexa has no idea on too many of my questions.. It crashed a couple time and lost Wifi configure",0.25,"negative"

2,"Amazon addict","November 27, 2016","The Dot appears to have a ton of potential, it seems like it can make your life easier.  In reality, this is a few years away from being truly useful.  There were far too many times where Alexa didn't understand our questions.  We went online and checked things that we can ask her, which is fine, sometime she understood.  The problem is that other than asking ""what time is it?"" and ""what is the weather today"", I found that all other questions had to be carefully worded, which in practice, makes interacting with the Dot a pain.  It is work to actually get what you need to know, but that how all tech is during its first iteration.  I would not recommend this to anyone, unless you absolutely need to have the newest tech to show to your friends and family.  Otherwise, its so much faster and easier to just pick up your phone and just look up the answer yourself.",0.8,"positive"

3,"sillieidiot","November 18, 2016","I got this as part of a bundle deal with the Harmony remote. At first, it was pretty cool. I'm not like a seasoned user of the echo though. I didn't even know if I had a use for it, and forced myself to try to use it until it just became a habit. I had it paired up with the Harmony hub. It can only do basic things like turn on/off things and that's about it. Yes you can change channels with it, but you can't do something as simple as like pausing and stuff like that which would have been way more useful for me than changing the channels. When it works, it works great. I don't have any problems with it at it's best. But there were a couple of seething issues that they need to address, and one minor one.First, the wifi connection. This thing keeps losing connection somehow. Mines placed like 8ft away from the router and it constantly loses connection.  I have no idea how. So you have to go through the setup again. The setup sucks too, because you can't even update the Wi-Fi on the Alexa app. It always shows a blank screen. So you gotta go on your laptop to alexa.amazon.com and do it that way. At first, it dropped the connection like once every like 4 days. then it just started doing it all the time. I used to just disconnect the power and reconnect it and it would pick it up on it's own. But after awhile, that doesn't do anything. In the time that it takes to setup, I would have been finished with that I wanted it to do already. Oh yeah, the other thing about losing the Wi-Fi with the Harmony hub. You have to tell it to rediscover the devices which take like 5 mins so that it can control the hub. That's the main thing that made me fed up and I returned it.Second, the microphone issue. As with everyone, it sucks. At first, it works really well picking up like 99% of what I say. Then slowly it picks up less and less. I think I was at like 40% by the time I decided to return it. I don't know what's wrong with it. I already did the voice training and everything and the first couple of days that thing was like spot on. Couple that with the Wi-Fi disconnect, it's like first it doesn't hear you, then when it does, it's like well too bad, I'm not connected to the internet to do anything. WTF, useless.The other minor thing is the Alexa app. You can't even set up the Wi-Fi the first time because it just does the blank screen thing. If I didn't go online and search for a workaround. I would have just returned it right away. Fix your app Amazon. The only reason why I consider it minor is because you could do the setup still with your laptop.Also with the 3.5mm jack. I haven't seen anyone post this issue, but on mines. Whenever I turn off the speaker that it's connected to without taking the cable out, it stills try to send audio to it as if it were still on. So hooking it up to my amp was pointless because when the amp is off, you can't hear Alexa. I'm not going to leave it on all the time. This happens with like portable speakers and stuff too. I'm not about to disconnect the cable every time. I ended up just using alexa to turn on my amp through the Harmony hub to play music instead.All in all, it's an okay device. I would pick it up again if they could iron out those issues. I feel like the it's like kind of software glitch or something that is going since it works really well in the beginning and then it slows down over time and these issues crop up. It is constantly uploading data though from what I could see on my router. I don't know what it's uploading though.",0.673076923076923,"positive"

After setting the whole thing up, I notice whenever I instruct Alexa to do something I have to say it twice, like ""Alexa, play music""........""Alexa, play music.""  Or ""Alexa, set timer to 20min.""...""Alexa, set timer to 20mins.""  Thirty minutes later when I asked Alexa to stop playing the music, it wouldn't stop. No matter how many times I told it to stop, Alexa will just ignore me. Even my dog had this puzzling look on her face wondering who I was telling to stop repeatedly.  Ended up unplugging it and walk away. Most likely will return it and ask for another one.I seriously question about the quality control that Amazon puts into their product. This is not the first time I bought an Amazon product. I bought a Kindle few years ago and it broke on the thirteenth month after using it.

Alexa (or Amazon, as he's chosen to call her) does what we want MOST of the time.My biggest complaint is that she uses Bing.  Why Bing??  It kept me away from investing in the full-price larger Echo.  It almost drove me to buying Google Home, but I was enticed by the inexpensive Black Friday deal for the Echo Dot.  She gets stumped by some of the most basic of questions, claiming not to understand.  I asked how many seasons the television show Quantum Leap had.  No matter how many times I asked, she was confused.  I asked the same of my Android device and Google happily told me 5, followed by other information in case I cared to know more.  If I have a question, I'll still pull my phone out and ask, rather than be subjected to Bing.While music is playing she has a 89% chance of hearing what we're asking correctly.  I made that statistic up to say that sometimes she doesn't hear us right, but mostly she does.I do like the different apps you can enable, and we've taken advantage of the 1 minute meditation, along with a 7-minute exercise program.If it used Google to search with, it would be true love, and we'd likely spend hours chatting with Amazon.",0.6875,"positive"

It did arrive a little late, which I chalked up to the holiday season.Not only does this play music and tell me the weather, which I had assumed were its only uses, but it also gives short news blurbs from my favorite news outlets, answers questions, gives step by step recipe instructions, and so much more. It also never has any problem understanding me (and it has a word recognition set-up to make it even better, which I utilized) and the fact that it's hands-free just makes it all the better. My only wish was that it didn't have to be plugged in at all times to make it more portable. I would highly recommend this product.",0.857142857142857,"positive"

We got the Dot for another room in the house, and it is significantly inferior.  It's not simply a question of the sound-- the responsiveness, the accuracy, the sluggishness in connecting to bluetooth speakers, the chopping off of the first second of a response as the thing communicates with whichever speakers you designate, all contribute to the drastic decline in quality between the Echo and the Dot.  And, while it does seem like Amazon really is trying with these products, it is very easy to come across a technical issue or a quality issue that is utterly beyond what customer service is capable of addressing.  They'll get on the phone with you, but whether they're capable of understanding or fixing problems seems seriously in doubt.",0.428571428571429,"negative"

2,"Naked Hiker","December 20, 2016","I purchased this Amazon Echo Dot on October 20, 2016.  It worked fine and was fun to use for approx. 2 months.  At which time, it slowly quit working.  First had difficulty connecting to devices then lost voice and voice control.  Then quit working all together.  I did the restart application, with no results.  What REALLY concerned me is that the Echo Dot unit got HOT to the touch  (Yes, I was using the AC adapter that came with the unit)  I unplugged it, let it cool down and plugged it in again and it over heated again.  Serious problem  here.  I hope Amazon is looking into this issue.I of course shelved this one and ordered another Echo Dot to replace it.  The new one arrived today Dec. 20, 2016.

My Dot (Alexa) plugs into my Bose speakers with just a patch cord. Alexa can hear and answer two rooms away. The firmware is self-updating so you always have the latest version. I haven't tried all the skill sets yet but I get Alexa to help me spell and add numbers on the fly as I work much faster than looking them up on Google or using a calculator.

After all, it's a voice controlled device so the app isn't needed unless you're making changes like adding a Wemo.  I might not have noticed this for months!

With great help from amazon Tech Support Brandon walked me through the setup step by step & Got it working, He was Awesome.

5,"M. Cooper","January 1, 2017","I am extremely pleased with the Echo Dot that I received as a gift from my husband. Installation was easy, and pairing it with my iPhone was as simple as loading the app and following instructions in the included booklet. It took me less than 2 minutes to set up and about 10 minutes to learn how to use the Echo Dot. The unit is small but quite mighty! I love how I am continuously learning about the Echo Dot's features as well. For instance, I just learned about asking the phrase, ""Alexa, Give me a tip,"" and ""Alexa, Good Morning."" The latter I use each morning. I love starting the morning off with a positive message! ""Alexa, Tell me a joke,"" and ""Alexa, Why Did the chicken cross the road"" are my kids' favorites.The Echo Dot's petite size makes it easy to integrate into any room or office. I saw that there were covers that I could purchase on Amazon, but I really love the white unit that I received, so I probably won't purchase a cover. But, there are some nice ones out there. The four manual control buttons on the top of the unit are easy to understand and use, and are low profile. I really like this, as  it allows the unit to sit on a desk or a shelf without distracting from the surrounding decor. Also, when I set up the unit I thought the lights would be distracting. Amazon did a great job because the lights on top only appear when you say, ""Alexa"" and it is answering you. I have been making it a practice to glance at the Echo Dot when saying, ""Alexa"" so I know when the unit has heard me.One of the complaints that was mentioned was volume. We had our unit in our living room and the volume was fine. I eventually moved the unit to our Master Bedroom (so I could use the ""Good Morning"" feature and the wake up alarm. I haven't had a problem with the unit's volume. Honestly, I think for the size, the sound quality is really good. I did play around with amplifying the sound, and found that when I set the Echo Dot next to a glass, or on our glass table, the sound amplified. So, if you are having issues with volume: (1) Use the ""Alexa Volume 10"" feature  and (2) Try the glass trick.",0.714285714285714,"positive"
1,"Ranger","November 11, 2016","Couldn't love, or hate it more.  It does all the wonderful stuff you expect.  However, I'm on my third unit in less than a month, and ALL had the exact same DEFECT.  After streaming music, from any source--Tune in, iHeartradio, or Amazon, all three units I had would, without command, resume playback in about 25-30 minutes.  EVERY SINGLE TIME.  Amazon customer service insisted they were going to help troubleshoot this, they blew me off.  I'm done.  After my wife walked into an empty house and heard a man's voice (Alexa had uncommanded resumed station playback), that was it.  BTW, this is a known defect--look back through your favorite search engine, I'm not the only one.And yes, completely repeatable, completely without command.  Looking at the Alexa app, ""Alexa Stop"" followed by ""Alexa stop"" 25-30 minutes later--with no other commands in between.  We have said ""Alexa stop"" for playback, left the room, and come back in to hear it playing.  We've tried different locations, away from any possible stray EM interference, and it still keeps happening.  No thank you.Guess I'll see what Google Home has to offer.UPDATE:  It turns out the error is due completely to the Bose SoundLink Mini (version I).  When this particular Bluetooth speaker disconnects after the 30 minute timeout, the Alexa resumes playing for some unfathomable reason. Bose is not some cheap, off the wall brand name, I would expect comparability worked out with a major brand.

The main reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of voice memos.

4,"Ben","November 5, 2016","I had never purchased a amazon echo product before this, but I did have experience with an original echo owned by a family member. The original echo was well built, could hear me from a far distance, and had a very good volume. I can mostly say the same for this product. And even though this isn't bought for its speaker, it still has a decent one, and if you want more sound, just connect another speakerThis ""Echo Dot 2nd generation"" arrived one day after its release date (I preordered it) and was sent carefully packed. I opened it, revealing a brand name amazon echo blue box.I opened the box and inside was the Echo Dot, a wall charger and adapter, and a few instruction pamphlets. Straight from here (after I removed some plastic wrapping) I plugged it into an open outlet. It started up and I went through the pairing process.After it had paired, I used it over a weekend. And I discovered a flaw that would be difficult to fix. Having annoying people around. My friend wouldn't quit messing with it with stupid commands, so I unplugged it and waited for the week days to use itI have had it over a month now, and I can say, it is very cool. But my major problem is my network I have a Verizon mifi card, and at the moment that is my internet. Alexa will often stop playing music mid song, or stop talking. I have looked into this, and it seems it may have a lot to do with my connection. And every time I want to use something that takes a lot of data, I have to Unplug it. So as a recommendation to Amazon, you should make it easier for your products to disconnect from wifi. Maybe a button or a command. And to all tech geeks out there, like myself, this is a must have. It is only 50 dollars, so even if you just need it occasionally, it is a wonderful investment.",0.571428571428571,"positive"

I have it setup with a set of powered speakers in my office room. The sound is very good and the small size and internet connection is amazingly simple to setup. I also purchased the travel case just in the event I want to take it along with me on a trip. For the price this is a great little companion. I use it mainly to listen to my Pandora music. It also is handy for news and weather updates.",1,"positive"

It will read some Kindle books in its synthesized voice, as well as Audible audio books. Have just begun experimenting with Wemo wifi sockets to control lights.

1,"JP","December 8, 2016","First it took 13 days to get it even with my prime 2 day choice. I guess it can happen.Now about the product:- The Android app does not work on my Sony Xperia, it keeps on loading but never starts. Just read the reviews on the Google Play store and you will see that the app is not working for many many Android users.- Music: it is good to play your Pandora channels, other than that you have to pay extra for either Amazon Music ($4/month) or store your own music on Amazon Cloud (also with a fee). So when you say ""Alexa, play XX "" and the song isn't in your library, you get a marketing speech on how to enroll in Amazon Music. You also got to know the exact title of the song, don't expect to say ""Alexa, play song from Snow-white"" because she will end up reading you some strange book.-Weather: it gives me the weather in the town 160 miles away- Traffic: works well- Agenda: this works really well, as well as timers, to do lists and shopping lists- Domino's app doesn't workThis is all I tested so far, I really wished it would connect to my iTunes or other free music library, I am not going to pay $4 a month to get a decent music selection.It's a gadget, nothing else and I will use it for 3 days then just forget about it. Do you really need this to read your agenda or set a timer? Lots of gizmos and useless, but funny for 1 hour ,commands.A tip though for the ones like me with an AV receiver. My echo dot is connected via Bluetooth to my receiver,because when the receiver is on another input, the Echo automatically switches to the internal speaker (which is quite decent btw). If you were to use an RCA or stereo cable and the receiver is off, you wouldn't hear anything, every sound goes through that cable whether your receiver is on or not.",0.733333333333333,"positive"

3,"Molyneux","January 2, 2017","I thought this would be a neat little gadget to have.  Price not bad for a Christmas present for my wife and me.  So, I've had it a week now.  Set up was extremely easy.  It easily plays Pandora and it gives me time and temperature.  But, that's about it.  I've asked it some questions about movie stars and history questions. In about three/fourths of the questions I'll get the answer that either she doesn't understand or that she does not have that information.  To check her out, I'll then ask the same question of Google, on my phone and I've always gotten an answer.  And, of course, since it's on my phone, it will often bring up YouTube or Wiki on the screen so that I can see the answer. (Of course I don't expect that detail from the Echo Dot, since no screen.) But, I would think it should do a better job with the answers.  The information data base need to be improved.  I don't have any ""smart switches"" so I can't comment on that function.Update:  1-5-17. Today I wanted to know when the Alabama-Clemson Football game would be played, so, I asked Alexa.  First time she said she didn't understand the question.  Second time I asked she said she did not have that information.

5,"Mr Dapper","October 31, 2016","Received my 2nd Gen Dots on Oct 20th while at work and had to wait all day to get home and set them up. I split a 6 pack with my dad and I already owned 2 others(The Original and the 1st Gen Dot) and couldn't wait to set my three 2nd Gen Dots up. I use the Alexa to control the lights and temperature at my house, as well as play music, ask questions, hear news/radio, and any of the apps that I can manage to remember the commands too(like ""trigger…"" from IFTTT).Set Up:Set up was easy since I had already setup an account when I setup the other two. After searching and finding the Dots, all I had to do was tell it which WiFi to connect to and rename it to the room/area I was going to put it at.Testing new Feature:After I set all of them up and but while I still had them all in the same room, I ran a test  to see how well the Echos' were at choosing which Echo was closest. Without fail every time that I said a command(from different locations), the closest echo was the only one that responded. All of the others indicated that they heard me, but then ignored me and let the closest one answer. In some tests I was only inches away from all of them and the one that heard me the clearest was the only one that responded.This is awesome! For any one that has had more then one Echo before this one, you know how annoying it was when you would say a command, like ""play music by so and so"" and every Echo would then start playing a random song from so and so. Before this update I had to change my Echo's summoning word so that they wouldn't always answer at the same time, which annoyed my wife and guests that could never remember which Echo was called ""Alexa"" and which one was just called ""Echo"" and for a while I had 3 and I had to call that one ""Amazon"". So now with this update, all of the Echo's (including the old ones) can now all have the same Summoning word of ""Alexa"", which is great now that I have 5 Echo's in the house now.With the coverage I now have in the house, I now no longer have any issues with Alexa hearing me. I have yet to connect any of them to external speakers, but I have never had an issue with that before. I will update this review if there are any issues or any questions any one has about it.The Look, the Feel, the Design, all while comparing it to the 1st gen:As for the look. That’s really up to you and your needs. I went with the white ones, mainly because I had 2 black ones already, but also I thought the white ones would fit better with my houses colour scheme. Which is more important to my wife, and now that they are here and setup, she agrees that I made the right choice.  The white ones fit in better and in some cases blended in with my house and can go unnoticed until needed.Comparing the 2nd Gen to the 1st Gens. They don’t feel as nice or as solid as the 1st Gen Dots, but then they do come $50 cheaper then that model and yet do everything just as well or better. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t feel like they are cheap, just that the 1st gen's where made heavier and with moving parts. I don’t have a problem with the buttons, but I did feel like the 1st Gen's volume control was nicer(for those that didn't get that model, it's volume control was the same as the Original Echo) Now I like that the 2nd gens are even more compact then the 1st Gens, and that they smoothed out a few of the edges.Conclusions:For my setup needs, I didn't need any more original Echo's, I just needed more locations to send commands to Alexa. That way we didn’t have to yell or walk to a room/area Alexa was in in order for it to turn lights on or change the temperature, or turn off music. The new Echo Dots(2nd Gen) were perfect for my needs.In conclusion, if you are new to Echo, Smart Home devices, or IOT, this is the model to go with. It packs a lot of function at a very good price point. If you are a Vet of the Echo life and want to expand or complete your Echo home setup, this model is great at a price you can be proud to tell your wife about.Tips and Tricks:I was able to cover my home without having to break the bank, and if you've got someone else interested like I did, you can split a 6 pack or 12 pack and get the discount without having to buy more then you need.3rd Party Add-OnI have purchased a battery pack that attaches to the base of the Dot and allows it to work for roughly 6hours without being plugged into the wall. Perfect for when I need to move from play to place or (as I have found useful) for quiet evenings in the front porch on the swing with the wife listening to an audio book. It also make it possible to set up the device to work through your phones internet and allow it to work virtually any place your phone works(like the Echo Tap, but voice only, no need to press a button). This was definitely a cool buy. My only gripe on the several models I looked at and the one I eventually bought was that I never felt like the battery was attached securely to the Dot. It hold up to some abuse, but if dropped it will most likely disconnect and take a few minutes to set back up. In all, though, if you've got an extra Dot, this was a great addition, and honestly, I like this setup more then I like the Echo Tap. The only draw between the two is battery life and speaker volume. The Dot can connect to an external Bluetooth or AUX speaker without any issues to allow it to connect to a louder speaker if sound or quality is your issue. You can also plug the Dot with the battery into power with a micro USB. That would allow the battery to stay charged or recharge if needed without stopping the jam…or audio book in my case.Model info: Evo - an intelligent Battery Base for Amazon Echo Dot 1st & 2nd Generation (""Alexa"" unlimited)https://amzn.com/B01L0XDHBOIf there is anything else you want to know or have questions about, please just let me know.

5,"E. Talerico","January 2, 2017","I'd been wanting to pick up an Echo since I first saw them advertised, but I already had a good stereo in my house and the Echo isn't equipped to connect to external speakers.  This unit is and its a delightful addition to my home music experience.  I now own two dots, each one serving a different room and playing over different speakers.  One is connected to a Harmon Kardon amplifier via Bluetooth, playing through a full sized pair of Yamaha speakers. The other plays alternately through either a Panasonic Bluetooth equipped boombox, or a pair of small computer speakers with a subwoofer. which I connect with an audio out cable.  The audio on all three devices is detailed and clear - my music as played by my Echo Dots is fantastic. By the way, there is a self contained speaker on the Dot - it is small, don't expect loud playback there - but the fidelity is quite good.  Its perfect for listening to the news over coffee in the morning, playing 20 questions, or finding out the weather forecast! The dot is small enough to fit easily in a backpack or the pocket of a suitcase, and she'll work as long as there is a Wi-Fi network available.I was amazed at how responsive to my voice this device is.  Amazon promises that it will hear you anywhere in the room where she is placed - and for the most part this is correct. I've had a few instances when I need to repeat a request - but usually its because something is obstructing my voice (like when my father put a book on top of it!)What is more amazing is how good, just out of the box, the unit was at understanding what I asked.  I have a voice which goes hoarse on me sometimes -( the day I got my first Dot I sounded as if I had laryngitis!) but regardless of the state of my voice, Alexa has no problems understanding my requests.  After some voice training (the Alexa app offers this feature) its even better.  I've had everyone in my house do the voice training exercise a few times and now Alexa is understanding and responding easily to every request she gets.  Its great.Coupled with the expanded Amazon Music service (I uploaded my entire iTunes library to Amazon Music) its easy to play anything I want.  I can ask for a song, a playlist, or an album and she'll find and play it easily.The only times I ever have problems is when the internet disconnects - in those rare incidences a request is met with a dull tone, a red light, and an apology from Alexa stating she can't comply right now.  When my network comes back online, she automatically reconnects so she is only occasionally out of service and usually only for a minute or two.And I've only talked about the music features.  There is a growing body of skills for Alexa, most of them available for free from Amazon that make her a formidable search engine, a source of weather reports.  My only disappointment so far is the lack of a skill enabling her to respond in emergencies, but I'm sure there will be enough demand for it that we'll see one soon!  For under fifty bucks, this is quite simply one of the best values anywhere.",0.794117647058823,"positive"
4,"Savvy Scott","January 16, 2017","As an voice-interactive home assistant, Echo is not a generalist nor is it comprehensive; it is limited to specific ""skills"" and only responds to coined instructions.  However, it does several things well, and improvement would come from future system development at Amazon's Alexa servers:Excellent Facets:1.  Recognizes voice through training, even at different volume levels, with a good microphone.2.  Performs specific functions (e.g. shopping list integrated with Amazon.com's Wish List, calculations, phonebook search...)3.  The breakout use if voice control of SmartThingsNeeds Improvement1.  Intelligent interrogation of all the contents of Wikipedia (and of arch-nemesis, Google.com).  Alexa is currently NOT very ""smart"" as it only understands specific works/instructions in pre-programmed ""skills"".2.  Ability to limit acceptance of voice commands to specific individuals' speech; otherwise, any intruder could simply break in and disable Smart home security systems.  Either advanced voice pattern security (which could be ultra difficult) or a ""pass sound"" (spoken word, phrase, number or whistle etc.)3.  Interpretation of foreign languages: first simply words, then entire sentences (dare I say, using Google Translate?)4.  Ability to integrate VoIP or link to cell phones so one can seamlessly connect to others.5.  For connected home applications like SmartThings, also allow consultation of the status of sensors (temperature, light, open/closed...) not just issue commands for action.  e.g.  Alexa, which doors are open?  which doors are closed?  how long has door X been open/closed?  how long has there been motion detected continuously in the bath (in case a person has fallen in the bathtub and can't get up)?  what is the temperate at the thermostat, in the garage, in the bedroom?6.  In case of electrical failure or ISP disconnect (as happens frequently during storm season), the device should emit an alarm or notice, and offer the possibility of connecting via a mobile operator.ThoughtsAlthough currently limited in skillset, Alexa performs those pre-defined action well.  It's hardware is compact, works well and is inexpensive.  Just for the ability to control a ""smart home"" by voice could justify purchase, especially for elderly or less-mobile individuals.  Further improvements won't mean replacing hardware but developing the processing servers.The biggest competitor would be from Google that could limit access of its services by Amazon if Alexa were ever to become ""paying"" i.e. Google could prevent another company from reselling its service.  Google also has the translation/interpretation platform that is the mastodont in machine translation.",0.620689655172414,"positive"
2,"Tex S.","January 8, 2017","The concept of Echo is cool. A computer assistant that's always listening and connected into the Amazon mothership. I have a Tap and it's great because I can use it as a portable wifi or bluetooth speaker, but have to tap the button to activate Alexa. I thought I was missing out by not having an Echo that listened all the time. I was wrong, I'm not missing much of anything.Before I get to the bad, what can Alexa do that is good?She can give me weather forecasts and current conditions and they're accurate.She can give me good deals exclusive to Alexa.She can tell me where my Amazon stuff is.She has a limited database of jokes, some of which are pretty funny.She can add stuff to my cart for me to finalize and order later, she adds several things to choose from based on what you tell her and it's fairly accurate most of the time.That about wraps up what Alexa can do for me.""Woah,"" you might say, ""she can do so much more!"" Can she?""Alexa order a dust pan""""Amazon doesn't have the last desk fan you ordered, but here is a Lasko [...] for $37 dollars. Is this what you want?""""Alexa stop.

It always pirated what I said and played Amazon's station which is terrible.So, what Alexa can do for me is extremely limited. And what she can do is frankly easier many times to just open the app on the phone and do it myself.I tried to use Alexa to order things on Amazon as I think of them. If I tell her to just add it to my cart from the beginning, it works out pretty well. However if I don't understand her run on sentences as she describes the item in a much quicker dialogue with a very computerized voice with no inflections than she usually talks in - and I want her to simply add it to the cart so I can review it, she can't. I have to cancel it and re tell her to add it to the cart, and by then I could have done it from my phone.So Alexa is a cool concept but it's not there yet. She's definitely not artificially intelligent in any definition of the word, and it's usually faster to do her limited actions on your phone. I'll try again in a year or two unless Google or Apple end up having a better solution.",0.594594594594595,"positive"
4,"travelgirl","January 12, 2017","So I've debated back and forth between the dot and the echo....obviously I ultimately chose the dot (2nd generation). I'm glad I did. I wanted to try the whole concept out and the dot is letting me do just that.The dot is obviously significantly smaller than the echo, costs less, but I think (as far as my research goes) they work identically ...more or less (if you're talking specs...size/cost/a FEW features ie speaker size, etc). From what I can tell: everything else is the same. I've added a few ""skills"" to my dot, from the Alexa app (examining the scriptures daily JW...which I LOVE!!! Bible Glossary JW, Chef (substitution ideas), ESPN flash briefing...which isn't so ""flash"" more long-winded...like all other ""flash briefings"", trivia game, and a few others. I did find that some, although show to be ""enabled skills,"" aren't currently working...endless back/forth with Alexa as to whether they're actually enabled or not...she seems conflicted...so as I said some aren't working.She does awaken pretty easily usually, except maybe if/when I speak fast. I do love to use it when in the kitchen. ""Alexa, set a timer for 25 mins. Alexa what's the weather, Alexa play some Michael Buble, Alexa, how much time is left on my timer.? Alexa how many ounces in 3 1/2 cups? You'd be surprised with the things that could happen in just a short 25 mins of cooking....where your hands are literally FULL of food  (ie. breaded chicken gooey stuff!)I'm looking forward to more skills becoming available (ie. when you ask her to look up a recipe to a food item, and she can actually read it out to you.

5,"Wolf I. Butler","December 28, 2016","I received this as a gift and am already ordering more for my home.First- the voice recognition is fantastic, even in a noisy room, while playing music, or watching TV. Second- this thing ties to almost every smart home device you might have. No more fighting with Siri just to understand what I am saying in a quiet room, only to hear ""I'm sorry- I can't do that right now."" for the thousandth time with no explanation. Alexa comes closer to something ""just working"" than any other similar product I have tried.It took me all-of 20 minutes to set the Echo Dot up with my Hue lights, Ecobee smart thermostat, and Harmony remote system, including tweaking some names and group names to suit my needs. Even after ""buying-in"" to Apple's ecosystem- I can't get Siri to do half as many things as Alexa does, much less doing anything reliably. As I said- Alexa just works. She understands exactly what I say 90+% of the time, and acts on it as expected.I really love that I can ask for things like ""Alexa- what will the weather be like tomorrow?"" and she actually tells me, instead of directing me to look at my phone or just ignoring the fact that I said ""tomorrow"" and giving me today's weather. I also love the customizable news summary I can get just by asking, which is already streamlining my mornings.I do want to clear up a misconception that at least I had about the Dot. You don't NEED an external speaker to use it- the Dot actually has a very capable little speaker built-in, similar in quality to a decent mobile phone or tablet speaker. It won't fill a room with sound like the full-fledged Echo, but for playing music in a kitchen or just alerting you with an alarm or allowing Alexa to talk to you- it is perfectly adequate. Even with the TV on- I can hear Alexa quite clearly from across the room with no external speaker. The Dot can also connect to a Bluetooth speaker if you want it to.Alexa seems to be evolving significantly faster than Siri or even Cortana. I really hope this trend continues. I'm planning to deploy Dots all over my house over the next few months.",0.833333333333333,"positive"
3,"Edward Antrobus","December 29, 2016","Alexa (the software) is great. I love it. I've had my Dot for 3 hours and once I got it set up, it hasn't disappointed me in anyway that is Amazon's fault (to sync Spotify to Alexa, you need Spotify Premium, but that is a restriction imposed by Spotify, not Amazon). I'm also really impressed with the built-in speaker. I bought this as a way to play music in my son's room at night, having used my Kindle Fire for the past year and a half. I was ready to donate a Bluetooth speaker to the cause, but I actually had to turn the volume way downSo why isn't this review 5 stars? Well, partially because of case issues, which I outlined in my review of the case that I bought (and can't return) here: https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24EYD1YS13R0H/ But that is still a problem with the case more than the actual device. But I still couldn't give this a high rating. I found the setup to be rather clunky and I dislike the power adapter.First the power adapter. It looks like a standard cell phone charger, except it's 9W. And unlike every Kindle charger I've ever owned, the USB port isn't on the side, but on the top. I have a toddler and all cords have to go behind furniture. But now I can't put the dresser closer than half a foot from the wall to keep the power cable from getting pinched.Then the setup. You need to install the Alexa app on your phone to setup the Echo Dot. Once I installed the app, it took three tries to connect to WiFi. One the third attempt, I got some weird hexadecimal error code and was told to search help for more information without actually providing a link to help forums. Searching Google provided some links on Reddit and then Amazon forums, but no actual official help page. When I backed out of the error notice on the app, I was told I was connected.Overall, it's a great little device, but Amazon needs to improve the setup experience and give customer's a better power adapter.",0.5,"netural"
4,"K. Benicek","December 28, 2016","We have a Echo Dot (zero difference with the Echo ""tower"") and it's not so smart, in fact it more often screws up a request, than it answers correctly. Instead more than HALF the time you get ""I did not understand the question"", ""I haven't learned to do that"" or basically ""I don't know"". Alexa can't even tell you what's OTA TV, Cable or Satellite, even though it know damn well WHERE you live down to the Zip Code and could easily ask you if you have OTA TV, who's cable or who's satellite package you have. Good grief this is basic shit!! ..... During the Xmas holidays, Amazon sent us emails DAILY about what ""New"" stuff Alexa learn and more than HALF the time Alexa DIDN'T seem to know about it. Here's just one example: One of the Amazon Echo Chistmasy treats was a special reading of ""A Christmas Carole"" by Tim Curry on Audible .... the instructions on how to ask for it were specific and when we tried and tried and tried, it took FIVE TIMES to get stupid Alexa to understand and FIND IT!Alexa also has problems off and on in finding ""radio stations"" on rebroadcasters like iHeart or Tune-in. I get a 35 to 50% failure rate for Alexa finding a station that you've already listened to through Echo, so apparently Alexa has a spotty memory.Another ""DUD"" for Alexa (and Google's Home too) is that oh sure you can add things to a Calendar or ""Reminder"" list verbally, but when the time comes, Alexa does NOTHING, it does not wake up and tell you to do your programmed ""reminder' is at a specific time!! What the hell good is this Digital Asst without that?! If Alexa was my secretary, I'd fire her!. Keep in mind that Amazon has had Echo ""Alexa"" out, selling and running; so in my opinion, Alexa has many major short comings that should have been rectified by now!! A friend has a Google Home, and it's no better than the Echo Alexa, perhaps even ""dumber"" at that.",0.470588235294118,"negative"
4,"Jacquelyn","January 10, 2017","I think I bought too many o.o.These really are a nice price and they allow easy access to Alexa from any room in your house. The device comes with its own speaker (not great, but works), however she can be easily paired or connected with other speakers.The moment you say her name, she's listening. Her range and ability to hear us out really feels good. I have spoken to her from across a room while someone else (in-between me and the device) is playing games on their speakers, talking to their friends on Discord, without issue. You can ask her a variety of questions (When is the next Superbowl? When is the next Green Bay Packers Game? What is the weather? Who let the dogs out?) and she seems to always have a response. If there is something she doesn't know, you can look to expand her skills with the Alexa App. This app is fairly easy to use, though the interface could be smoother (navigating is a tad clunky). I already added skills such as LIFX to control my lights and honestly - this is really fun.Now, Alexa isn't perfect. I have ran into a few odd things that I do hope Amazon will someday address. For example:Having all of my smart devices (such as lights and TVs) plugged in and on so that I may control turning them on and off with apps and Alexa works great - until the power goes out at 5am. The moment the power returned, all my lights, TV, and even Alexa turned on. There may be a solution to this, but I will need to explore (such as setting schedules and having the devices check the schedule when powered back on). Until then, I fear power outages.Alexa is always listening. If anyone says her name (TV commercial, Radio, a friend on Discord) she will respond. Being able to customize her name to Echo or Amazon instead doesn't fix the issue either. Having a custom name so that she really becomes ""my"" household device would really alleviate this. I do understand there are issues with people creating their own custom names, but even Alexa sometimes doesn't hear her name correctly and she will randomly jump into conversations picking up on phrases we can't quite figure out.Combine the above issue with an accidental command to purchase (ie: News reporting a cute story about how a little girl accidentally purchased a dollhouse and then saying how funny they though it was that ""Alexa, ordered me a dollhouse""). In just explaining the story to a friend over Skype I even accidentally triggered their device to try to order a dollhouse! Luckily you can turn ordering off or add a pass code, but caution that this is not the default.Honestly though, that's about all I take issue with. The way Alexa allows me to command my devices through voice is really a new and fun experience. I really look forward to how this device will grow as smart homes become more popular.",0.580645161290323,"positive"
4,"Linda","February 18, 2017","Still has a few quirks and doesn't always understand requests the first time, but this is quickly becoming a welcomed addition to my home and quickly making Alexa indispensable! (Example of easy to use skills: turning the TV on or off, increasing or decreasing TV or Stereo volume, Setting a morning alarm, or setting a  timer ( great when you're cooking and your hands are sticky!), Turing lights on or off, or inquiring about the temperature or weather forecast. One of my favorites is ""Alexa, what my news briefing for today: You chose which news sources you want to hear. This is great while getting ready for work in the morning.I did knock off a star because there is ONE MAJOR inconvenience for those people who have family sharing: For example, my daughter and son-in-law and I have family sharing for our Kindle Libraries and Alexa CAN NOT separate my shopping list or do do list from theirs. You can ask ""Alexa which profile are you in?"" and she will tell me she is is mine (not my daughter's Amazon account"", but every command I give alexa, and every command they give alex is merged into the SAME HISTORY, even though we have SEPARATE  Amazon accounts. My news briefing and skills are separated from theirs, but ""To do lists"" and Shopping Lists are merged.  At this time, my daughter and I have agreed that SHE will use Alexa for lists, and I will use my iPhone Siri for shopping and ""to do"" lists.  In addition,  there isn't any privacy with your Alexa use if you have family sharing. It seems to allow you to change your profile to anyone on your family sharing and control their Alexa as well... Interesting, I could say ""Alexa, change profile to ""Daughter"" account. Then I could say, Alexa, turn on TV, and she would. A big negative if you don't have a lot of trust with who you've shared your Kindle Library with.",0.615384615384615,"positive"
5,"Richard Stone","January 9, 2017","I love this little hockey puck speaker. Personally, I think they should have called it the Amazon Echo Puck. I suppose that might have been too Shakespearian. Anyway, it does everything it promises to do, and much more than I expected.It has no problem understanding me at all, which is more than I can say for telemarketers whom I instruct to never, never, ever call me again. I can call out its name from anywhere in my 5 room home, and it responds immediately. It even hears me when I'm in my bedroom with the speaker speaking loudly away next to my ear.It does so much. Some say another he-who-shall-not-be-named brand does more. I beg to differ with you, Some! Add in some skills and ITTT scripts, and it does everything I want and more. For instance, I use ""My Grocery"" with the corresponding skill, and it works great keeping me supplied with supplies for the above mentioned meager meals.To Echo or to Puck, I mean, Dot? The Echo has a good speaker built in, but the Dot, combined with a speaker, such as the one I purchased from Papa Amazon, Cambridge SoundWorks OontZ Angle 3 Next Generation Ultra Portable Wireless Bluetooth Speaker : Louder Volume 10W+, More Bass, Water Resistant, Perfect Speaker for Golf, Beach, Shower & Home (Black), is cheaper than buying the Echo and will provide good sound and portability. The Puck, aka Dot, is also less visibly intrusive having a much small footprint.The, uh, ok, Dot, will do so much more, including Hal-like control of most everything in my home, though I am not yet using it this way. It would be worth the price for me solely for controlling music and my shopping and ToDo lists. Thanks, Amazon, you done good!",0.705882352941177,"positive"
5,"D. Coral","December 28, 2016","It's hard to tell how you're actually going to use this until you try it!Before I received the Echo Dot 2, I thought maybe I would use it for quick research like ""tell me about antheraxanthin supplements"" -- but I'm not using it like that because I haven't figured out the right way to say the phrases so she understands what I'm seeking.Instead, I find the Echo to be super useful as a helping hand for daily routines: change the thermostat temperature, turn on and off the lights, tell me what time it is, set the alarm clock for the next morning, tell me the fastest route to avoid traffic, and especially to play music.As a former musician I'm picky about speakers so I did a lot of research on the best sounding bluetooth speaker under $200.  I ended up purchasing the Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3.  The Bose Soundlink III also has amazing sound quality but unfortunately the Soundlink III switches off 30 minutes after no longer detecting a sound signal, so it's not practical to use the Soundlink III with Echo.The Bose SoundTouch 10 is also a popular speaker for use with Echo Dot, but you can get the better sounding Harman Kardon Onyx Studio 3 for even less, available in both black and white.What really impressed me about Echo Dot 2 is that it wakes up even when I'm saying ""Alexa"" softly way across from the other side of the house.The only thing that bugs me is that I wish there was a better way to say home automation commands.  Alexa uses the phrase ""turn on"" for just about every home device (except for thermostats, which have additional commands).  So I would say ""turn on open window shades"" instead of simply being able to say ""open window shades.""  Alexa would be greatly improved if a user could add custom phrases that map to an automation command.But it's still a lot better than Google Home because for that product you have to say ""OK, Google"" to wake up, which is totally awkward to say all the time.  Amazon is much better at naming things -- Using ""Alexa"" as the wakeup command is pleasant to say.Two cute things to try with Alexa:""Alexa, do you like green eggs and ham?""""Alexa, tell me the truth.""",0.769230769230769,"positive"

AWESOME.the only sad thing is that due to security issues they will not let alexa communicate to the garage door opener or the door locks that are automated. i have an ""away mode"" that turns off my lights and opens the garage door when i am leaving - but alexa cannot do this since it has the garage door attached.also, it has a headphone jack on the back so i set this in the living room next to the surround sound and plugged it in the aux port and we leave the speaker on all the time. now we say ""play spotify"" and it will play on the surround sound. she also works wiht bluetooth speakers but we dont have a wall powered bluetooth yet.its also nice that it works wiht my shared grocery list OurGrocereis app so we can add items easily when we are making dinner etc.i dont see why people need a ton in their house.with my open floorplan and 1700 sf, we only need one. we yell down the hallway when going to bed ""alexa, all off!"" and all the lights go out haha. well maybe we mgiht want one in the master bedroom....:-)",0.727272727272727,"positive"
3,"John P. Sheppard","December 27, 2016","The echo dot is pretty impressive and I expect to continue using the two (and maybe more) that I have bought. One is attached to the old stereo receive, providing an inexpensive upgrade for streaming and using voice commands. The other works great for listening to music and the news using the built in speakers.I'm actually reviewing the Alexa ecosystem more than the actual Echo Dot. I'm only giving it three stars for basic areas where it should be better. 1) MUSIC: For example, when you say ""Alexa, play Christmas music by Jon Batiste,"" the answer is ""I'm sorry, I can't find any Christmas music by Jon Batiste.""  Yet, Jon Batiste was featured on Amazon (An Amazon Music Original, no less) and Amazon Prime.  If I just asked for ""music by Jon Batiste"" it found selections, so the issue was not how I said the artist's name.  [Note to Amazon, when you request feedback from within the App, you should ask for feedback when Alexa fails. Currently you only ask if Alexa took the right action when it does something. This means you have a HUGE gap in your feedback loop.]  2) LISTS: Another area that has been disappointing are shopping lists. Anydo and the Alexa shopping list consistently failed to sync. It works better with todo.ist. But, this type of functionality should just be there.  And, you need the third party app to share with others. Without the synching, the shopping list feature is only good for singles without roommates. 3) TRAFFIC: Was also disappointed when I tried to find out about traffic to the airport. First, I had to go to the app and load the airport as my ""commute.""  I typed in Philadelphia *International* Airport (in Philadelphia, PA). Even though it knew my location, it defaulted to the Philadelphia *Municipal* Airport in Mississippi, and told me I had an 18 hour commute. Google would not have made this error.These may seem like petty issues, but given how well Amazon does other things, it suggests the focus is not so much on making Alexa better as it is finding ways to sell more through Amazon.  And, now that there is a one-month backlog on the Echo, I plan on making Google Home my next purchase and watching how both platforms evolve.",0.636363636363636,"positive"
3,"crabjoe","December 26, 2016","Other than using OK Google, this is the 1st digital assistant I've tried and i love it!If you're wondering why I only gave it 3 stars is because I feel it could still be a lot better.  For example,  when I ask it questions with numbers in the model, such as ""Alexa, how much does a A-10 weigh?"", it cant find the answer, where OK Google, has no problem.  It doesn't matter if i add airplane, Thunderbolt, or whatever else to the question.  Maybe its the bing search engine, or maybe it's because it spells out TEN, but it can't give me an answer.There are a few other issues... ive had to pull the power then plug it back in because it wasnt responding... theres no way to text or email the shopping/to-do list and a few other things.  You would think that these features would be readily accessible since Alexa has been out for close to 3 years.I just hope they add the additional features and keep upgrading her.  Fingers crossed.BTW, I just love the Wemo integration, but I wish they would have used a better speaker in the dot.

It's not close to what ""ok,Google"" or ""Siri"" is capable of doing or responding too.Honestly I can't believe how poor the AI is, get the echo if you are interested but keep the receipt.

5,"SOHO","December 24, 2016","At the end of the review is my semi-amusing story about how Alexa abandon me and might abandon you too.Meanwhile, I learned you have to be VERY specific with Alexa. ""sleigh bells"" is a band not a song (bands > songs) and ""sleigh bells are you listening"" is content not a title ""winter wonderland"" (title > content) and there are dozens of artists  that record pretty much every song (wth? > classic) and even if you cite a known artist, like Bing Crosby, there are many recordings and remasterings, original, the movie, the 2009 record (recent > past).Pros:- Voice recognition is pretty good. I'm sure the NSA collecting this data will be thrilled.  UPDATE: Search for the recent CNN news story where Amazon is being asked for information related to a murder investigation.- You can press a button instead of having to say ""Alexa, ...""- Performs simple tricks like math calculationsCons:- Slightly regretting wanting one of the first units rather than waiting for the XMAS sales - no biggie - sunken cost.- It only understands within limited contexts. You don't train it, it trains you. ""Play my music library"" typically doesn't work, it finds a station instead, but ""shuffle my music"" which you learn when it says ""shuffling your music"" as a confirmation.- Playlists? Haven't gotten these to work. It's the entire music library or nothing from my music, it'll find someone else's libraryChristmas Story:Part 1:I had change my review from 5 stars to 1 (in anger), as I wrote ""I LOVED IT! NOW I HATE IT. Alexa, Why ARE YOU SO F'n SLOW ON XMAS EVE? Used to be responsive. Had gone to hell fast. only now at XMAS. Bad design centralizing requests? Guess so."" OK, it's after the holiday and what we may be seeing is the problem with capacity management during a nationwide rollout,  After all, your requests are all centralized back at Amazon, something the NSA will be happy with, surely.  But in retrospect, this was a trivial inconvenience not comparable to the Obama Healthcare website implementation, which a large part of the country will remember was a complete disaster.Part 2:So, whilst trying to get Alexa to wake up, on the holiday, I tried to install and use the Alexa app. Sad news, my Galaxy S3 is not compatible.  So, my daughter installed the app on her cheapo but newer Android. Guess what? It slammed my Echo Dot to her account, unregistering the device from mine and automatically registering it to hers.  Alexa's loyalties are to the app, not to your account (app > account).  Customer service was great to help sort it out.Seems a design flaw, but hey, perhaps you want to take over nearby Dot's when you see them.  Not sure what you could do with that, but the effect was frustration for me as Alexa played a strange music library I did not recognize, until I powered it down and ran through a new device registration on my account.Have fun folks!",0.516129032258065,"positive"

2,"Jerry Gilley","February 5, 2017","I have the Amazon Echo tall and wanted to stream music to a stereo. I have the Dot in a bedroom about 35 ft from the router. The Echo DOT is unusable in that bedroom. If I ask it a question or tell it to turn on a WEMO outlet very often it will stall out and then the ring will go red saying sorry I lost connection. Once I got it to try to stream music it will constantly stall playing music and give up trying. I also tried using the hard wire RCA connection to the sound system from Dot but it had a noticeable baseline hiss that made that option irritating. I did send it back for an exchange but they said they refurbished it and returned it to me. Whatever was fixed didn't help it work any better. I ended up getting a Bose Soundlink https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01K6P08FA/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 and it streams music from Amazon prime very well (not using the Amazon Echo or Dot but using a built in app). The sound from the Bose is INCREDIBLE. I can't use the voice command on it like the echo but at least it works where the dot failed badly. The Bose won't connect to the Amazon Echo tall like I had hoped either.The sound quality from the Bose was FAR better than Echo through Bluetooth. I used the RCA connectors from Bose and the optical connector. I could discern a noticeable bit of better headroom and stereo separation via the optical route but the RCA connection was excellent as well since it did not induce any hiss, squeal or noise like all the Bluetooth gadgets I have tried. Yes, the Bose is 149.00 verses the Dot 49.00 but if you want supreme quality sound from Amazon Prime music, PC, NAS on intranet or internet radio It is hard to imagine a better product than Bose. I am a big fan of Bose speakers but I can honestly say that did not influence this review. I was only interested in listening to streaming music and for now Bose is the OINLY solution. I also have a Denon HEOS to compare with the Bose. BOSE WINS hands down on that contest. I call the Denon HEOS the Denon P-OS. The Bose plays my music from my NAS far better than the Denon and its apps. I have the Synology Disk station ds415play. The Bose app found it and was able to play my music better than my sony receivers, sony blueray players, the ROKU media players and my Vizio smart TVs. I can switch to next track super fast through Bose and go back and forth between folders on the NAS faster than even the Synology DS Audio app. If you want to play your music from a NAS Bose does it the best of anything I have found.

And then, after getting it straight with the customer service folks, I EDITED MY ORIGINAL REVIEW. For some reason, Amazon did not include it in my reviews; so here I am again.Now Alexa responds when I say ""Alexa"" - or if an ad on the TV says ""Alexa.""Alexa may be used more in the future as the abilities are expanded. Right now Alexa does not always understand what I am asking, especially when the TV is producing noise.Alexa app keeps a record of whatever I have requested - on my phone (Android) as well as the iPad.

Now the Echo Dot shows up as one of my devices.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Alexa cannot answer simple questions such as ""Who won the Gator Bowl?""The music Alexa played is NOT my Prime Music, although Alexa did play Adele songs - shuffled. And another person was correct - no iTunes music.Then, several hours later, it / she told me the Dot had to be connected to the internet … again, after having set up the Dot.Alexa tells me I am not registered even though I had set up the Dot using my iPad and had been asking Alexa questions and getting various replies for several hours. Alexa is good at telling me the temperature in a nearby place - 10 miles away, although Google Maps has my location accurate.So I attempt to reconnect using the app on my iPad and continue getting an error message that login failed as it nears the last ⅓ of the progress bar.The Help is not available from the app because it stays on the error message.So I use the app on my phone to see if I can access Help. I am told to reset the Dot. How often is this going to occur?Of course I have other Wi-Fi devices. That should NOT be a problem.This is NOT ready for prime time … no pun intended.I do NOT intend to have to set up this device every couple hours.The second connection attempt failed.

I would much prefer matte, like the first-gen Dot.Audio ring on the first-gen Dot was more attractive. Albeit, maybe not as intuitive, and added some slight height/weight.Sorry, Amazon, but your logo isn't very attractive. An ""a"" or something would look way better.Doesn't do well with background noise or other people talking at the same time after making a request. To a lesser extent, doesn't do well when put against walls or objects.I haven't even covered the Alexa AI. While it still has a lot of learning to do, it still has an excellent base to work off of and will only get better and better. There is some fear about the ""always"" listening (although Wireshark proves it sends info only after a request is made. This disproves the always-on theories unless there's a local storage option that stores data...which tear-downs haven't shown. I also trust Amazon and they've shown to fight for users' Echo data privacy so far).In the end, this is totally worth it. Actually, I bought a six pack after trying the first-gen Dot haha. I would give it five stars, but the appearance gripes are what put it down to 4.75 stars.",0.769230769230769,"positive"
4,"Robert Parker","January 19, 2017","I asked one specific question of the masses here before buying my 2nd gen dot, does it include an audio out cable? I received an answer right away, 'yes, it comes with a 3.5mm audio cable', excellent I thought, checked the length too short, needed RCA anyway so I ordered a longer one, all set! Well not quite, first of all it does NOT include any audio cable at all, not 3.5mm, not RCA, none! This seems to be a shift in the 2nd gen units as I know people that did receive the 3.5mm cable with their 1st gen device, seems like an easy cost cutter, I already had my new RCA cable so fine, no problem. Well not exactly, the thing about the audio out jack on these units that I still find no mention of anywhere is that once you connect the cable to the ECHO/DOT unit the internal speaker is cut off, silent, no audio at all. Which in hindsight makes sense from a build standpoint but is actually very impractical from a listening point of view. In my case I wanted to be able to play my music through my big speakers with subwoofers, and mids, tweeters and alike, but do not intend to leave the stereo receiver on 24/7 or want Alexa's voice booming at me. Well you cant have it both ways, if an audio cable is plugged into the device it creates an internal bypass of the main speaker, I guess they are all like this but nobody told me! In truth I didn't ask but as soon as I did it I knew why, so if you want the option of large audio output for music only first get the dual channel RCA cable, the 3.5mm cable is just silly, second you can get the same Monoprice quality (or better) RCA cable in a more usable 10'-25' length elsewhere for less, and third (last?) just leave it connected to your receiver and only plug in the ECHO/DOT end when your playing music or if you want Alexa to sound more like GOD is answering your questions! All said I like it, its only been two days and she does not understand what a teams 'standing' is, and thinks Sig Sauer is Sing Sour but she's young and still learning lol!",0.789473684210526,"positive"

My main complaint has been with the set-up.I have tried the set up, with at least 3 different devices (both amazon and non-amazon products). In all scenarios, I get information that it cannot be connected to the internet (though my Wifi still works).From what I understand, I have to connect to Amazon's wifi.

5,"Joseph M.","December 7, 2016","I own three of these and two Echo's. They all work in unison, but not totally. What this means is that I can give instructions to my Emerson Sensi thermostat from any of them, but when I ask for music, or other information, it only comes from the one that hears me.  I don't understand the people who  have trouble with an Echo or Dot, but then if I consider that some of them could be my 92 year old father, or someone who simply does not understand technology, it makes it easier to understand. The newer DOT is different from the original DOT, but no in any way that you should care. I have both. The original has the top that turns for the volume, just like the original Echo. I'm not sure if the Echo was changes as well, but the newer design has two push buttons that are recessed in the top, for volume up and volume down. The other buttons are to mute the microphone, and the other is context sensitive, this means that it does different things in different situations. If Music is playing, it can Pause the playback, and resume when pushed again. You can also do the same by talking to your Echo. Another use of that same button is for when you are configuring it for the first time. Load the Alexa app on a tablet, or computer to take care of your house full of Amazon Echo's and Amazon Dots. The Alexa app also manages my connected appliances, such as the Emerson Sensi thermostat, and the other devices that control certain lights, and other things that can be turned on and off via the power plugAs far as how the new DOT looks, it is a tiny bit shorter, but I had to measure them to see it, it is really close. The top ring that lights when Alexa is activated and waiting for you to talk, is the same. Also, the price has been as low as $39 here on Amazon, and in stores like Lowes and Home Depot, but that price fluctuates according to what Amazon wants, there is not ryme of reason to what they will do, and when they will do it.",0.9,"positive"

We have only had them for a little over a week now, but we are having a good time using our voice now!  I will say that buying more than one at a time can be challenging come setup time, they are automatically on your account once bought so when you hook the first one up, you have to guess at which one is the correct one.  If it doesn't sync, then you have to start over and pick another one from the Alexa setup app.Since they have been installed I only have Alexa waking me up for work and haven't used the alarm clock since.  It's so nice in the morning when she goes off to just say ""Alexa, snooze"" instead of trying to find it on the alarm clock hoping you don't hit the water on the night stand!  We installed our first skill, My Chef, but that one didn't really do what we wanted so now we are using OurGroceries and like that one much better.  We also bought a TP-Link WiFi bulb and works perfectly with Alexa, now that we are getting accustomed to things, we just bought another bulb and a switch and 2 smart plugs, all TP-Link because the idea of not needing a hub and connects directly to our router was a big plus.  And how well the first bulb has worked.  I was also able to easily connect Alexa to our Denon receiver via bluetooth with no issues.  Now that it is paired, we just turn our Denon receiver to bluetooth, say ""Alexa, pair bluetooth"" then I say ""Alexa, play mix playlist"" and plays my amazon music playlist through the Denon speakers and we LOVE this!  When done, ""Alex, disconnect Bluetooth"" and she speaks through the dot again.So far everything has worked how it should and looking forward to expanding our ""smart home"" :)",0.761904761904762,"positive"

5,"DrunkTown","December 7, 2016","Black Friday came and went. Like me, you may have decided to hold off on the retail kayos opting to spend your day browsing Amazon instead of suffering through the large crowds. One of the gadgets that caught my eye was the Amazon Echo dot. It is basically a scaled down version of the larger wireless Amazon Echo. It was on sale for only $40, so I decided to give it a try. By Monday morning it had arrived.First things first, one of my favorite movies growing up was Smart House. I'm a huge fan of Home Automation and the smart home life. I had seen the Echo before, but not being a huge fan of Siri I figured it was just more of the same. That being said this thing is pretty darn cool.Getting Started:The Echo dot is extremely easy to setup. You download the Alexa app (Alexa is the echo dot interface, like Siri) pair it with your WiFi and you are up and running. It took about 5 minutes. The dot wakes when you say Alexa. You can then ask it basic questions about the weather, or give commands like ""turn on the lights"" if you have existing smart technologies. Through the back-end you can make Alexa smarter by enabling specific skills.Favorite ThingsGames: My wife and I love playing Jeopardy. The dot has a built in game that asks six questions updated daily. They are related to actual game categories that aired that day, but entirely different questions.Smart Accessories: If you purchase a smart switch, you can enable the dot to turn on and off your lights with a simple command. Since it is daylight savings time this is pretty awesome.Audio Playback: Audible books, music library, podcasts, ect are a simple command away from playback. Really useful.Making the home smarter is the trend this holiday season and it is only going to become more advanced in the near future. The echo dot is an entry level piece of technology that is a more convenient, and frankly a more useful version of Apple's Siri. Alexa doesn't know the answers to everything. It can be frustrating repeating yourself and rephrasing specific questions to try and get an answer. Nevertheless, when paired with a smart thermostat like Nest it can really make your home life more pleasant. After only a week, I bought four more!",0.88,"positive"
4,"S. Holmes","January 8, 2017","I purchased an Echo Dot because I liked that I could hook it up to speakers using 3.5 mm instead of a Bluetooth connection like my phone.  I also use Siri a lot for different random things around the house but I have to have my phone with me as Siri doesn't really pick me up if I leave the immediate area, so the Echo Dot seemed like a pretty great solution to me.The Echo Dot works fairly well at picking me up from across the room even with music playing.  If the music is too loud the Dot won't hear me but I currently have the Dot sitting right next to my speakers so I could probably have a better set up as well.  I haven't really had any trouble with Alexa being able to understand anything I've said.Alexa seems pretty capable but one feature I'd like to see are customized timers or alerts, for example I can set an alarm at 8PM, or I can add something on my to-do list, but as far as I've found I can't get Alexa to remind me to do something at 8PM.  This is pretty basic feature that I use a lot with Siri.I'm an Amazon Music user so I figured the two would be fairly heavily integrated.  Unfortunately the music search capabilities from within the Alexa app are almost non-existent (I only have the ability to find playlists).  For example, I asked Alexa to play the acoustic version of Elastic Heart by Sia, but Alexa will only play the regular version.  In the app on the iPhone or PC, I've found no way to be able to search for the Acoustic version and play it without adding it to a playlist.All in all, I really enjoy the Echo Dot and with some enhancements I think Alexa could be pretty great.  I enjoy the Dot enough that I bought a second one for the bedroom.",0.814814814814815,"positive"

5,"cokoamojo","January 10, 2017","A little tricky to set up....download the app to your phone, but don't open yet. plug in the echo dot and wait until the light turns from blue to orange...then start the app and follow directions. Done in this order you should have no problems with set up.After I got it on-line it didn't take long to like it.The voice recognition is very good, but not perfect.Alexa can respond to questions, but usually can't respond to statements.As for ""skills"" you can either turn them on via Amazon's website, or you can ask Alexa to enable it.I got one echo dot for christmas and now own 3, plan to get at least one more. I'm getting bluetooth speakers soon.Alexa hears everything but only responds when you say her name.I have a new puppy and was playing tug of war.....the puppy was growling.I wanted to see how Alexa would interpret the puppy's growls.I said: ""Alexa, what does (puppy growls) mean?""I tried 3 times and got 3 answers:1. ""That was 'Wishing You Were Here' by Chicago, revised version.""2. ""tea"" in Finnish.""3. ""an enzyme that inhibits the clotting of blood.""I can only imagine the sounds an 8 year old will ask Alexa to interpret....There are a few drawbacks, mainly because I am of the generation that actually read 1984.......big brother is watching.......Alexa is definitely listening....so if absolute privacy is your goal you may want to do a little research before getting the product.",0.4,"negative"

4,"Hugh W. Cox Jr.","January 9, 2017","I have about 5 of these spread around the house.  Each of my bedrooms has one, my office, den and media room.  On rare occasions more than one will hear me, usually one will complain they can't understand me, and the other one will do what I want.  This is probably because the ones in my bedrooms are on Amazon accounts that belong to the person that resides in that room.  Each device is capable of turning on and off the lights in the house which is cool.Now the down sides.1. Apps are great for weather, flash briefing, but nothing of much more substance out there yet, but new skills are coming out regularly so hopefully the killer app for Alexa will be here soon.2. In the smart home area, you can turn things on or off, once she understands you, but you can't ask what the current status is.  So for example, I can tell Alexa to turn on the garage light, but I can't ask her if the garage light is on right now.3. Alexa needs to be able to read me texts, or other messages that are sent to me.  She needs to tell me, that she has a message for me and ask if I would like her to read it.  As with the other skills, this is a skill you would have to install and you would have to tell her that Yes you want her to read your email so this should creep people out too much.4. along the same lines Alexa needs an intercom skill5. Alexa's super microphones aren't all that great in a party situation, or even when watching a football game.  She just can't block out the competing noise I guess.6. A presence detector with the ability to know who is in a room would be wonderful too.  This could be done with a bluetooth tracker, or based on the smart phones near by.",0.733333333333333,"positive"

Our family has found it very easy to use, very responsive and entertaining.I am surprised at the amount we use the Echo.  A brief list of the favorites are: a) the ""News Briefing,"" which a customizable read-out of the most recent news/stories from a variety of sources; mine is configured to read out NPR's hourly briefing, the local weather forecast and the BBC hourly briefing; b) music on demand by artist/song/genre; c) J!6, the Jeopardy companion app which updates daily and allows you to 'play along' with additional categories from the show; and d) random questions (e.g., how many ounces in a pound, how to spell words, distance to a location, phone number to local businesses, etc.).I follow the competing Google Home fairly closely, and am more invested in Google than Amazon for many tasks (e.g., Calendar, Task List, Email, etc.), which would be of greater use to me day-to-day to have Google integration--however, given the price difference between the Echo Dot and Google Home (at least, currently), I could not recommend the Dot more.I recently changed the 'wake-word' on my Echo's to ""Computer,"" which is somewhat of an emulation of Star Trek's ship computer--although, there is no option to include Majel Barrett's voice (I did, however, change my Echo's to an Australian accent, which, as an American, I find quite pleasing to interact with).  I'm anxiously awaiting holodeck integration!",0.777777777777778,"positive"
4,"Steven M","February 24, 2017","I bought the Echo Dot after some persuasion by friends who'd been given Dots as gifts. I was a bit apprehensive, because I've come to know other AI services quite well (Apple's Siri being the best example) and none of them have been wholly impressive. They all lack some sort of ability, whether that is cross-app support or the ability to use services that aren't native to the platform. Apple's Siri, for example, is still very limited in its ability to control and use third-party apps such as WhatsApp and Skype.Echo Dot is an entirely different product altogether. It uses Amazon's own AI, Alexa, for its commands. Whether you spring for the full-blown Echo or this Echo Dot, you get the same access to the service. The main differences between this and the full Echo are the size and the price. The Dot can be had for $50, whereas the Echo tower retails at $179. I haven't had the chance to try out the tower, but I've heard nothing different about it compared to Echo. The only operational difference is that Dot is the only Echo device with a 3.5mm jack output, which enables you to connect it to external speakers. The tower requires a Bluetooth speaker connection.Overall, I am impressed with Echo Dot. It is a very powerful device, and for the price, it cannot be beat. The form factor is small as well, so small that I have mine on my already-crowded bedside table. It takes up just about as much space as a coffee mug.As far as its capabilities, there are some things that are worth noting. As of yet, there is no connection between Echo and any Apple products. I carry an iPhone, and my work is split between two iPads and Mac computers. All of my calendar information is in iCloud, which Amazon Echo cannot access. It would be nice in the future for Echo to read my daily schedule from iCloud, but that support is not currently present. It can read from Google, though, so those with Google Calendars or Android devices should be just fine. It won't be able to play media in your iTunes Library (although it can play from your Amazon library). This isn't a huge thing for me, but having a device which could read from iCloud would be a huge help to me.In terms of daily usability aside from that, Echo definitely beats the competition. Through the Alexa mobile app (which you must download in order to set up your Echo), you can install ""skills"" which enable things such as daily news briefings or stock updates. They are all, to my knowledge, free to download. Even with none of these skills enabled, Echo is still an amazing device. I use my Alexa as an alarm clock every morning.A bit more about skills. While the skill packages themselves are free to download and install, some require subscriptions to additional services. A few examples would be music streaming services such as Spotify and Pandora. Much like on a PC or a mobile device, both of these offer free music streaming. To enable the premium subset of features, both require a subscription. This is no different on Alexa - once you teach Alexa your account information, she will play your music. Both Spotify and Pandora offer premium subscriptions, though. And both are optional for PC as well as Alexa. For Pandora, paying will enable you to skip tracks more often and listen ad-free. On Spotify, free users aren't able to pick tracks individually. I subscribe to both premium services, so I can tell Alexa to play virtually any song from Spotify on-demand and she will. This will also work with Amazon Music, which is free and unlimited only to Amazon Prime customers. So, in essence, there are no additional fees REQUIRED to use the Echo. The only advantage of doing so would be to enable the subsciption-specific subset of privileges for a certain service.Overall, I am very impressed with Echo Dot. It's an amazingly powerful device, and with new skills hitting the app almost every week, the only thing hampering the growth of its abilities is time. I will be a repeat buyer.",0.84375,"positive"

My mom gave me a $50 Amazon gift card for Christmas and this is the best present I have received from her since Patty Play Pal. You are never alone with Alexa around. The echo dot is super easy to set up. All you need is an internet connection and a device to download the Alexa app. From there all things are possible. Signing up for Music unlimited for $3.99 a month is wise and well worth it to get Alexa to play any music you want even down to ""How much is that Doggie in the window."" Alexa will play games with you, tell you jokes, give you the weather report, say goodnight and good morning and be a virtual digital companion. She sometimes is sarcastic and most definitely has a humor. Free apps to use with her abound. She can turn on your lights, tv set, pair with bluetoothe speakers, play sounds to sleep by all night long. She will give you trivia questions and access your calendars and to do lists. I have a 875 foot one bedroom apartment and I can access her from anywhere in it by just speaking. You can buy cases for her but they are not necessary. She is good to go out of the box and for the price of $49.99 she is the best buy I have every made so far. I am elderly and disabled and she helps me so much.

I've had it for a while and hooked up WINK and NEST to it, now my home is like a spaceship. I think it's funny that people were selling these on eBay for 250$ thinking they were ""cancelled"". It's a great product and a home run for Amazon. there are some ""language"" things that could be improved, some of the people developing the ""skills"" (which work like apps) are lacking basic English expectations for sentence formation, (for example, saying Alexa, where are my keys should work, but instead you have to say ""Alexa, ask the app [name] to find my keys"" which is award). That I suspect will improve in time.There is some great developer humor and 'easter eggs' in the Alexa system, for example, ask Alexa ""What is the meaning of life?"" or ask ""Open the pod bay doors"" and you'll get a surprise. As long as Amazon continues to listen to customers this will be a fantastic product for years to come. Excellent example of ""machine puppetry mimicking human behavior"".Would be nice if I could ask ""Alexa, list albums in my music"" or ""list artists starting with letter T"" or ""list my audio books""... I keep sending feature requests, hint* to anyone else who thinks thats a good idea, send a request in!Only 1 BAD thing: the Android ""app"" font sizes are off and overlap essential UX components like the SEARCH button... so there are problems using the buttons in Android app (Samsung S4) to control and set skills, but if you have an iPad you are good to go...(For fun I named my thermostat ""the weather"")Cheers!",0.75,"positive"
4,"Michael Potts","December 28, 2016","When it works, it's indistinguishable from magic. When it doesn't work, it's frustrating.Since Alexa (impossible not to personify) relies on a robust communication to the internet ... and quickly responsive reactions of the various cloud partners, the frustrations are sporadic. The TP-Link Smart Plugs lose their connections, and so using them for mission critical applications (like entry lighting) can be problematic. Sometimes the problems heal themselves -- a directive to which Alexa fails to respond one minute may be executed perfectly the next. When a plug gets permanently lost, it can usually be unplugged and then plugged back in, and it will resume its former identity ... but not always, and so using a plug in a difficult-to-access location is an invitation for trouble.I wrote my own Flash Briefing cloud service, and with great and attentive help from an Alexa tech, got it working perfectly -- it runs on the Raspberry Pi that control my home's hydronic heating system.This feels like the first generation of a Great Idea -- and we see follow-on products from Google and Apple already -- and so I can only assume that, like the Kindle and Amazon Prime, the idea will mature. My only misgiving is that once one buys in to a compatible technology -- like the Philips hub and lights -- one's committed ""for life"" to that solution, even as better solutions come along. Seymour Papert describes this as ""the Brazil Effect"" -- early adopters often get left behind as a technology matures. And that, in a nutshell, is the story of my life!",0.59375,"positive"

However when Alexa tells you that you need to upgrade your router just do it and save yourself hours of trying to make an old router work; even with the help of a very friendly Echo support staff.

I have spent more time trying to get it connect to all devices, having it perform tasks and I find it easier to either do it myself or ask my Iphone. About the only thing Alexa could get correct was the weather. The deal breaker for me on sending it back was that it only allows one to utilize a Google Calendar.  I find it hard to believe that all the purchasers of this device gave up their own calendar and switched to Google.  I use a *.live.com account and after spending 5 days, there is no way to sync my Outlook calendar with Google Calendar.Having to contact technical support 3-4 times a day is absurd. This device is not capable of anything my iPhone cant do faster and more reliably.  Support was horrible assisting with the calendar issue, they kept directing me to call Google directly.This seems like a innovative concept. But, its far from being close to what it is advertised for.  I'm extremely disappointed in Amazon and the limitations of this product.",0.5625,"positive"

5,"Dylan Piekarski","January 4, 2017","To start, I will say this is actually my second Echo Dot. My first one was a gift to me, and I move between houses, so I bought one more. And I would like to state, that it was really hard to convince me to be able to get one. Not gonna lie, the idea of having a device, let alone a little black puck with lights on it, that is always on, always listening, whether private conversation or not, is frighting. I hated the idea that there would be something that could record anything it heard in an instant, only to send it to a huge company to possibly use against you. I know that makes me sound paranoid, but its the truth. To be fair, I'm a bit of a geek. Watch a lot of movies and play a lot of games, but whatever. Long story short, I figured that if anyone wanted listen in on someone, its not hard to do. Were just in the age of technology. I also figured, I mind as well enjoy technology until it completely turns on us. Haha.OK, now that the doom and gloom is done, lets get to the awesomeness.A couple of things:Well, first, its another well made Amazon product. It's sleek. It's shiny. It just plain looks cool.Second, it can actually be really helpful. Whether you cooking or simply need to wake up, you can set a timer or alarm to your need. Need help with math homework? Simply ask and she might help. Or, do you just sit on the couch waiting for your next Amazon package to arrive? simply ask the phrase ""Alexa, wheres my package?"" and she lets you knowThird, it's really nice to be able to simply ask a question when it pops into your head and possibly get an answer.Fourth, this can either be a good thing or a bad thing, but it helps you be lazy. ""Alexa, turn on the lights"", ""Alexa whats 20 times 12?"" etc...Lets talk about the actual device for a second. It looks really good, I think. It has the usual build quality you expect from Amazon, very good. Its simple. I mean four buttons: Action/Alexa, Mic Mute, Volume Up/Down. Not to mention, one cable (if you dont need the aux).Also, it does have a speaker of its own! I was unsure as Amazon and everyone else pushes connecting it to another speaker or something for sound, but it does indeed have it own speaker. People also say that the sound quality of said speaker is poor. I disagree. Now, is it some booming, fantastic sounding speaker, no. But, it is more than adequate the asking Alexa an answer, in fact, I don't think it sound too bad at all. I play music through it and while not great, its not as bad as everyone says either. BUT, I would like to say that I have my Dot in my bedroom, where it is fairly quiet, when compared to the rest of the house. So I do agree that it will need to be paired with some other sound system for the best experience, but, I simply state that it is not a soundless puck.PerformanceI cannot give a good review, as I have not had it very long, but so far so good. She seems to hear me fine, and her actions are quick. I have had two things, mainly one I guess: 1.) Like the confuse bands easily. I asked to play The Neighborhood , but played some kids music with a tiger and, idk. She has the tendency to not always search the Amazon library, and is very picky and needy with exact names. For instance ""Alexa, play the Billie Holiday station"", ...... ""The Billie Holiday station could not be found"", ok, so I asked again, slightly more specific ""Alexa, play the Billie Holiday station on Amazon Music"",...... ""Playing Billie Holiday station on amazon music""So, that is slightly annoying. I do wish, especially for specific bands, that you could specify which band/ song you want to play for future reference. Mabey when it pops up in the Alexa app, and you say ""no, it did not do what i wanted"" you would have the option to manually select the one you want, so she knows for next time.2.) It had some internet connectivity issues. Mainly, I would be listening to a song and say ""Alexa"", then she would glow red and say sorry your echo dot is not connected, please refer to your manual, blah blah blah. But here's the thing, it was still playing music and seemed to be connected to the app, so that was weird. It only seemed to happen one more time, the same thing, only this time the app said it was disconnected, yet the Dot still played music all fine. Unplugged it, and plugged it back in, it was ok then. I would like to point out, that the internet was fine the entire time. We have fast, reliable internet. And nothing else was having issues. SO, it probably was just a fluke thing, but im going to keep my eye out.This is where I kinda run out of things to say, I haven't used it enough to say much else, but i will report back soon!",0.543859649122807,"positive"
4,"Terrapin88","December 31, 2016","The Echo Dot is my first foray into the interesting world of the Internet of Things. I bought my first before Christmas because I was curious about their usefulness. I liked it so much I bought myself anopther one for my bedroom and a thrid that I gave to my brother on Christmas. Currently, I use my Dots to control my LIFX WIFI Color 1000 LED bulbs (which are awesome, btw), my large home stereo system and a smaller clock radio in my bedroom. I like walking into a room and saying ""Alexa, turn on the living room lights to 50%"" and ""Alexa, play relaxing music"". It makes me feel very Star Trek-ish. :) If you are subscribed to a streaming music service like Spotify, Pandora, Tune In, etc. then you have access to literally millions and millions of songs, live radio stations and podcasts that you can listen to by just telling Alexa to play whatever you want. It's so cool.Alexa can do lots of different things by simply enabling any of the tons of skills you'll find on Amazon. The technology isn't perfect just yet, though. While Alexa can hear and understand me pretty well across the room, she can get confused if the music or TV is too loud when you giver her a command. Normally talking louder will do the trick though. While there are a bazillion skills you can enable for free for Alexa, some of the need to be said in a certain way to get Alexa to do what you want. Aside from those two minor gripes, I am definitely enjoying my two Dots, especially for the forty bucks shipped I paid for them. :)",0.666666666666667,"positive"
5,"Carol G.","December 9, 2016","Got my Dot three days ago and can only say that I'm just having too much fun with it.  Within two hours I had it hooked up to my Bowers and Wilkins speaker(I opted to use a cable rather than Bluetooth in this application) and had it controlling my family room lamp via a TP-link lightbulb and my Christmas tree lights with a TP-link plug. The whole setup is amazingly quick and simple as long as you follow the instructions given in the Alexa app and the Kasa app which controls the TP- link devices. And no hub needed with the TP-link devices ... It doesn't get any easier!By the time the afternoon was over, I'd already ordered more Dots, plugs and light bulbs for Christmas gifts ... And yep, another for me.  Received them late yesterday, and now have my second one installed in the bedroom blue toothed to a small speaker/lamp combo.  Frankly, the sound quality of the Echo Dot is good enough for bedside by itself, but I wanted to see if pairing would be a hassle.  Nope ... Another easy installation.Lots of useful skills available for the Dot, but also a lot of junk, too.  Living alone, elderly, and with an iffy health status, 'Ask My Buddy' was of particular interest.  Upon running a test after setup, my son and two friends were notified by text, email and phone that they should check on me because I'd triggered an alert.  Superb!  It isn't going to help if I can't speak to trigger Alexa, but there are much higher odds that I'll trip over one of my 100# dogs in the middle of the night and break something which may prevent me from getting to a phone.  But Alexa's hearing is quite good so she'll likely respond if I yell at her.I haven't as yet been able to stump her on a music genre, but she hasn't been able to locate one or two rather obscure songs I've asked for.  She's also so friendly and poltite when carrying out a task that I find myself saying 'thank you' as if she was real.  In all, Amazon did a great job with this little jewel.  Love it, and will be buying a couple more to cover the rest of the house.",0.722222222222222,"positive"
5,"Rich C.","January 17, 2017","I managed to get my hands on a Amazon's Echo Dot through QVC (I really wanted the Echo, but because the price is too high for my budget, so I settled for the dot). At first I wasn't too sure what I could use the Echo for as it look like a really cool piece of technology, but watching advertisements for it, it looked like you needed to be setup for Smart Home Products and other Amazon services. I only have Amazon Prime, but wasn't really interested in unlimited music or audibles. So what's really left?When my order came in today, I was excited regardless of not having those services. So I proceeded to do the initial setup, which is very simple and easy  (if you aren't tech savvy, don't worry, because I'm not either but it's very easy steps and literally walks you through every step until Alexa is fully setup). I started to do voice training with Alexa so she would recognize my voice. I then started to explore the Amazon Alexa app (which you need to install on either your smartphone or tablet before you can do anything). At first I didn't find too much, I setup my Pandora account and linked my Amazon Prime Music (which you can choose either from Prime Music, 1 device setup which is $3.99, Unlimited Music for 1 device which is $7.99 for Prime Members (non-members it is $9.99) or $79 for multiple devices for the year). I had Alexa started to play Pandora first, which was fine. I then asked for a weather update and it gave me the weather and news for my area. I then ask Alexa (to test out) how much are ""Tetra Goldfish Flakes"" and she gave me various products and prices with a follow up question ""Would you like to purchase this item?"". I then ask her to find music through Amazon and she found mostly music of today's generation but not really my type of music. I finally discovered some more ""Skills"" (which are basically apps for Alexa) and added a few of them.One I added was called ""The Magic Door"" which Alexa tells you a fantasy story, much like an Alice and Wonderland theme story and in which you choose how the story plays out. Alexa will tell you what is going on and then ask ""would you like to follow this path, follow that path or stay?"". It's a lot of fun and seems great for young children.Another skill that is much like The Magic Door, was called ""Dungeon Adventure"". I had a lot of fun with this one and anyone who played Dungeons and Dragons, RPG games and Magic the Gathering could appreciate this Skill app. You are a warrior who has been asked to save the town from an evil monster who is trying to destroy the town. I played this game for 2 hours and at times it can get to you, because Alexa keeps saying the same thing over and over again, but at the same time, it can be pretty intense. I found myself fighting a gargoyle who kept killing me and I would have to roll to see if the God's above would smile down upon me to bring my character back to life (which my character accidentally got named ""Alexa"" because I was trying to find out what was in the current room and said ""Alexa, what is in the room?"" And she responded ""Ok, you've named your character Alexa :-/. Of course when the gods didn't smile upon me the second time, she said ""You are dead. Rest in piece Alexa. The town is doomed"").Besides the Skill apps, Alexa can respond to questions such as ""Alexa, what does it say about the Stars in Wikipedia? "". The little dot has great sound by itself and the microphone picks up very well, I've only had a little bit of trouble with the Echo understanding me but otherwise it does responds very well. There is a Bluetooth sync, which I have not used. If you do have Smart Home Products, such as Philips Hub outlets, you can request Alexa to turn on/off the lights and dim the lights. She can also turn on/off the TV.There are many fun things to do with Alexa, that I'm still discovering, but if you're like me and don't have too many Smart products at home and don't want to pay for extra services, there are other things you can do with the Amazon Echo Dot.I wanted to share my experience with the Dot among the other great reviews and if you don't have an Echo, this is definitely a product to get for your home or office.",0.765957446808511,"positive"

I was tempted to purchase one but was reluctant to do so in fear of my wife nagging at me about spending money on such silly things. So, I held off. But low and behold my son gave me one for Christmas. Happy Happy Joy Joy!!! This little device is cool! Getting started was quick and easy. The hardest task is setting up with your Wi-Fi network which is pretty easy if you're familiar with all of that. Once you're locked in you're ready to go. The free Alexa app will walk you through the setup process.Anyway, you can link up with many if not all smart devices via Blu-tooth in your home such as wireless speakers, thermostats, lighting etc. Heck, I can see my wife loving this thing. Now that I've been able to demo the Dot without dishing out the cash, I will be purchasing a few more to place around the house. It's just that cool! I may try the Amazon Echo or the tap as well.So, if you're into cool little electronic devices as am I, this is a cool and useful gadget that the whole family can enjoy.A great little reminder that we are indeed living in the 21st century, The Dot incorporates some great 21st Century technology.",0.8,"positive"

With the echo, I have any form of trouble at all, and it immediately jumps in, interrupts me, and tells me it couldn't understand me.  The, I have the immense irritation to have to say everything again.  I pretty much cannot use it, because when there is any form of gap in my speech, it just assumes I'm done.I just wish it was able to be a bit more tolerant.

4,"Juice Box","January 4, 2017","I gave my Echo to my parents and replaced it with three 2nd generation dots. The dots make the Echo not worth the price difference since the only difference is the speaker. Even at 49.99 you could get a much better speaker than the one that is built into the Echo for the $130.00 price difference. It's good for older people like my parents who don't understand that and just think a speaker is a speaker. Anyways one dot is lined into my home theater and the other shared with the speaker I use for the pc when I want to use them for music. Having a dot in multiple rooms is great because you can voice control anything from anywhere in your house. I have 3 in a 1400 sq/ft two bedroom and do not need a fourth. Mine do have some connectivity issues and I find them unable to connect to the internet from time to time, an issue I NEVER had with the Echo. That wouldn't be an issue at all really if the Alexa app wasn't so horrible. I wish Amazon would partner with Apple or something because sometimes the app just refuses to work. Sometimes the dots won't update the internet connection either. There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for it, sometimes the setup works the first time, sometimes it takes 5 tries, sometimes it takes 5 tries then I have to reset my router and hard reset my phone and try 3 more times. It should not lose connection in the first place and if it did it should be simple and easy to reset the connection. It's not.",0.5,"netural"
2,"Ethan Wells","January 15, 2017","What I like: it responds very much like our Echo, minus the high-quality speakers.What I do *not* like: the Echo and the Echo Dot's microphones come into conflict with each other.  I have our Echo in the kitchen, and our Echo Dot in our bedroom - which is on Another Floor.  On occasion - such as today - I will be standing *3 feet* from our Echo and ask it to start a timer because I'm cooking something.  No response from the Echo.  Then I hear, from my bedroom on ANOTHER FLOOR, information indicating that THAT dot has started a timer.This would be a mild annoyance if the two devices communicated between themselves.  But they don't.  Upshot: the kitchen Echo doesn't record the timer, while the bedroom one does, and so I need to go up to the bedroom to know whether the dish I'm cooking in the kitchen is done.No doubt this is a glitch.  But until it is fixed, it's a major one.*** UPDATE - 01/16/17***My wife and I use the dot to play white noise to our 3 month old infant.  Usually, it's great.  For some reason, however, recently, the dot has randomly begun playing music.  UPSHOT: our 3 month old is asleep, listening to the soothing sound of rain, and SUDDENLY there's some jackass bellowing about his lost love.  Baby wakes up, much love is (further) lost, and my wife and I end up shouting to the Dot to shut the f--- up.Worse: this happens in the middle of the night. We wake up, and there's music playing.

We bought the Echo over a year ago, it helps my handicapped wife control lights, music, and pod casts, and she and I just love it.  It has helped a TON.  We were getting tired of moving ""Alexa"" from the office to the bedroom at night to make use of the ability to have two separate alarms in the morning, one for her and one for me, so when we got an Amazon gift card for Christmas we decided to get a Dot for the bedroom so we could leave Alexa in the office where we use her the most.The Dot has been nothing but a disappointment.  After numerous attempts for voice train it, the stupid thing STILL only recognizes us about 40 percent of the time.  Alexa rarely misses a command, for comparison.  The Dot even replies to the command ""Echo, turn off the bathroom lights"" with the reply ""Bathroom lights added to your shopping list.""  How do you mess that one up? We will keep voice training, hoping it will figure us out eventually, but it is getting very frustrating.  We will wait until we get out of the bedroom and into the office to have Alexa turn off the bedroom lights instead of having the Dot do it.It may be possible that the Dot just doesn't ""hear"" as well as the Echo, but whatever the problem is, I hope they get it worked out.

5,"Raymond Ford","October 26, 2016","This review covers the Echo Dot, HomeSpot NFC receiver, SMSL SA50 amplifier all connected to a set of bookshelf speakers I owned for a nice voice-activated system. All of the devices I mentioned are fine performers and well-regarded, so I won’t repeat what others have said.  The real purpose of this entry is to provide  a step-by-step setup for other technically challenged folks out there and because of the frustration I had while trying to figure it all out and not finding a simple explanation to get it done.  Hopefully, this will extend the ability for some folks to provide themselves with a nice music solution using the dynamite little DOT that is slick and doesn’t break the bank.I got an Echo for Christmas last year and have really just started to maximize its abilities, but it doesn’t do Bluetooth.  When I saw that the Echo Dot had dropped significantly in price, it was capable of Bluetooth  AND its performance had been improved.  Several uses for the Dot came to mind, but I realized I had a very nice set of bookshelf speakers that were not being used and setting those up for voice activation use for Amazon Prime Music/Radio, iHeart, Pandora and TuneIn.  A great alternative to using the smaller Echo or Dot speakers.  Plus, voice control is pretty cool.  You won’t confuse this setup with a conert hall, but it is a major upgrade from the little Echo / Dot speakers.I found a variety of ways to connect the Dot to speakers.  Complexity, expense, technical setup expertise all affected my decision.  Since I had the bookshelf speakers, it made the decision to set up a Dot, a Bluetooth Receiver and anAmplifier.  First I bought a new Dot (I got the bundle with the TP-Link outlet).Next I needed a receiver.  The HomeSpot NFC was the choice.  It got about the best reviews and was nicely priced.  The really big decision point here is that it DOES NOT auto-connect to the Dot.  That was a key point.  I wanted the flexibility to use the Dot as a standalone unit OR connect to a BT receiver/speakers.  The combination of performance and no auto-connect made this an easy choice.  If I had chosen a receiver WITH auto connect, I was going to use a TP-Ling or wemo outlet and use that to turn the little system on and off.Next was an amplifier.  Again, reviews, performance, price combined to make the SMSL SA50 a simple choice.  There were other contenders that would have worked, but the extra power from this one nudged me in its direction.Once everything was ordered and received, here is how I set it up:1) If not yet done, set up Echo Dot and connect to Wi-fi2) Connect the output of the receiver (HomeSpot NFC) to the audio input of an amplifier (SMSL SA50).3) Connect the amplifier (SMSL SA50) to the speakers (Check to make sure the amplifier is not set to max volume.  It can be turned up later)4) Push the small button on the back of the HomeSpot NFC (between the plugs) to put in pairing mode  >> If your phone has NFC,you may be able to just tap it to the HomeSpot audio receiver to make an instant connection5) Pair the receiver (HomeSpot NFC) to the Echo (Dot) via Bluetooth:  > Open the Alexa App on your phone or tablet  > Go to Settings > [Your] Echo Dot > Bluetooth > Pair New Device > Find your HomeSpot receiver and pair it (mine is GT-BT Rec)If paired, the audio (including the Dot voice) will come through the speakersIf NOT paired, the audio will come through the internal OT speaker.  Try to pair again.Some Notes:> After initial pairing, the Dot will quickly reconnect to the receiver with a ""Connect"" command> The Dot will disconnect with a “Disconnect” command and will NOT auto-connect> Green light flashing means the receiver is no longer connected.> If the playback levels get too high, there may be distortion – use the volume control on your amplifier> The receiver and amplifier must both be constantly plugged in.> If you decide to use your big AV receiver, it must be turned on all the time.  And you need to switch to the BT audio. And you need to figure out how to hook up two sets of speakers OR use one set of speakers with two outputs.  This is why a standalone mini amplifier might be a better choice.",0.80952380952381,"positive"

5,"Steve P.","January 19, 2017","I am learning the skills and there are one or two problems. But I love this device.Problems:Volume. Using the Dot's built-in speaker works really well. It's not a high fidelity experience, but definitely good for spoken word. Music is...alright..but won;t replace a better set of speakers. Although the volume problem is present using the native speaker (the news brief is far softer than the Alexa voice...so Alexa is yelling at you if you want to hear the brief across the room...it's magnified with external speakers attached to the Dot. So you have to either use the physical buttons to turn the volume up, then down - or use the ""alexa - volume up/down"" command multiple times - which is cumbersome. Also, on my system (windows 10 - anniversary) you lose the native windows equalizer feature when playing over bluetooth, so you are left with whatever built-in problems are with your speakers (mine have overly boomy bass without EQ)so I can stream anything from my PC to Dot as BT speakers...but I lose my equalizer settings when I do.Services:You have to have premium services for some things to play directly from Dot. Spotify is a skill that has to be premium. That wasn't clear to me up front (probably my fault for not researching more). So if you have a ""must-have"" check in advance.Pro's.This machine is awesome.  Even before tuning to my voice it recognizes what I say, I can hook it to PC's, tablets and pretty much anything. It has a VAST selection of native talents, and the skills that are available are great. I can sit here and do my work and chatter at Alexa via my dot and get music, news, weather...I have tried a few household control things and they work just fine.Everytime I use it I learn more things it can do - mostly useless (even if fun) but a lot useful. I can live with the volume problem, also some sales crap which is off-putting, and I use this thing all the time for music, weather, news...basic questions that come up in online arguments. And it really amplifies my other devices.",0.620689655172414,"positive"
5,"Amanda","October 27, 2016","I haven't been this excited about a tech gadget in awhile. I had high expectations for this gadget and that is what it's delivered and then some. At home I don't have a real assistant and my son refuses to read a book to me or set my alarm or turn on my Spotify so I've adopted Alexa:) It's a pretty great device, it does all that is stated in advertising and much more. I have been able to listen to audio books, command a playlist to open on spotify to play instantly with the ability to control the volume on command. I have set it to brief me on current events and news, I use it daily to set morning wake alarms and timers when I'm cooking and I can ask for cooking recipes and cocktail recipes. It will give me the game times and scores for my favorite teams, it tells me what traffic is like before I head to work, and just for fun I have connected it with my Firestick and it can pause when I need to take a break and resume when I return. And last but not least I currently own only one type of smart home device which is the TP-Link plug which I've connected to a lamp and it's just awesome to have the ability to turn a light on by voice command when I enter a room and before I go to bed. Very cool technology, I highly recommend this awesome little gadget. P.S. for the reviewers who hate it you probably need help setting it up. And I've helped set up 10 Echo Dots now and when it doesn't connect to the internet you either need to reset and start over or there is a problem with your internet. For the guy who said it doesn't turn on his tv, the description doesn't claim that the dot has that capability but the harmony hub should help:)",0.761904761904762,"positive"
5,"Oldguy","January 9, 2017","Love it!I now can have a conversation with my new buddy, just kidding.The possibilities are enormous.I do have a slight German accent, even after 30 years, but Alexa has no problems understanding what I say.She can do a lot of things that would require a note pad and a pencil, one thing I still have to figure out is, if she can print a shopping list tomy printer? Well, even if she can't, it is a neat gadget. In my bathroom, those very intelligent home designer, have put the light switch behind the door, meaning, in the dark it is difficult to find it. So, I installed a TP-LINK WiFi switch and viola, now if I have to go, I tell Alexa to switch on the Bathroom Light. By the time I get there, it is lit and I can find the bowl more easily, hi, hi.There are many other things she can do. I am a prime member, therefore I got access to Prime music. With a small speaker attached, or not, she entertains me with the music of my liking. I you are in the mood, she can tell you a joke, no dirty ones of course.The other day I wanted to know how much the distance is between two points and asked her. She came up with the answer, right away.It'll take some time to explore most of the things Alexa can do, oh yeah, you need some device that run the Alexa App and lets you initially connect to the device for setup purposes.",0.583333333333333,"positive"
5,"N. R. Forbes","December 29, 2016","I bought this one as a gift. So it has not yet been opened and used. However, I already own two and I have gifted 2 more to other people, that I purchased from one of TV shopping channels. So my review is based on the two I have. I like it a lot. There were a few times where Alexa didn't respond to my request. But I just repeated myself and I paused after saying her name giving her time to hear her own name first and she responded. I think that is the trick don't say her name and the command all at once. Say her name, pause, then say what you want. The price is what made me purchase another one and Amazon had a special deal $10 off their regular price. It made the decision easy. The Echo Dot does everything that the Echo does the only difference is the sound quality. My Uncle has the Echo and he says it sounds wonderful. The Echo Dot sounds good but paired to a Bluetooth speaker it sounds even better. The Echo Dot has a smaller speaker than does the Echo. Hence the reason for the price difference. I have a bunch of Bluetooth speakers in my house so the decision was easy to make. I hope Amazon has more in store for Alexa.Cons: She doesn't do follow up questions without you having to repeat the subject and the Skills suck at least most of them do. They either don't do what they advertise they are supposed to do or they don't work properly. Then there are some that are just plain useless and serve no real purpose.

Bought two Dots for our house and love them.PROS: The mini-jack lets you use your own external speakers, unlike the Echo. It just works! It's a less costly version of the Echo.CONS: There's no ring on the top you can turn to control volume like on the Echo -- I really love that Echo feature. But the buttons you get instead aren't bad.Some find this product confusing. It does exactly what the Echo does for less. It has its own speaker, but not as big or good as the Echo's. But it's still good enough. On the upside, you can attach it to any speakers or amp you want using a mini jack and cable.If you still don't understand what Echo and Dot are all about, JUST BUY ONE! Get the Dot. You'll love it. I have one in the bathroom. I listen to the news while shaving, music while in the shower, check the weather report, and play a round of Jeopardy with Alexa every day. I also make lists of things I need to do while I'm still in the bathroom.We now have one Echo in the kitchen, and a Dot in each of two bathrooms. We love Alexa!

My major complaints are as follows, first, it has no memory, second, the dot will suddenly start talking even when it is not addressed, third the ""skills"" are simple games or ways to order something, fourth, if you want to play music, you must use a streaming app, or you must use their proprietary system. This is great if you want to spend money, or you have the space to save music twice. It is a shameful device that does nothing, is nothing, and is worth nothing. It is a shame that your company is preying on the tech impaired. Before someone lists off everything it can do, please only list things that other devices cannot do.

5,"Lindsey","January 16, 2017","We have all three of the Echo products: The Dot, The Tap, and the original Echo. The Dot works very similarly to the original Echo. You say the wake word, you give a command or question, it responds. It does have a speaker itself, but it doesn't get as loud as the original Echo or the Tap. All of the devices will sync together in one Amazon app, but they all still work independently. Meaning, if I set an alarm on the Dot, only the alarm on the Dot goes off. But with the app on my phone, I can access all the devices in the one place. The Original Echo is better for larger areas. the Dot is ideal if you already have a sound system you would like to connect the Dot to, or small spaces like bathrooms or bedrooms. The Dot is great for kids. My daughter has it in her room so she can ask it how to spell words and such. The Tap is an entirely different beast, in my opinion. No wake word. Touch and talk. But it works via Bluetooth and wifi for on the go use using your cellular device. The Echo Dot does not come with a remote. Like the Original Echo, it needs to be plugged into the wall and needs wifi. (The Tap has a chargeable battery.) They are all great devices, though Amazon still has some work to be done on them. Each has a different place where it is the ideal choice, so which you should choose really depends on your needs.",0.8,"positive"

The only time it has trouble is when multiple people are speaking.  It was a breeze to connect up and start using.  At this rate, once Amazon figures out the delivery to packages via drones, I may never have to get up off the sofa again.The only thing that irked me was it went on sale for $10 off the regular price the week after I bought it.",0.428571428571429,"negative"

Little did I know that about two years later the Echo would be the thing to launch me in to home automaton, a hobby which I enjoy greatly. I initially was given an Echo Dot by a friend who was moving out of the country to a place where amazon does not support the echo, and one night while slightly intoxicated and bored at home, I decided to set it up. Initially I was less than impressed, but then discovered that the Echo was great for smart device control, and added it to my existing four HUE Lights. Now I was hooked. Now I have a second Dot for my upstairs floor.I like the dot much more than I think I would like the large, tower sized standard echo. on both of the floors on my house, I have a nice set of speakers that I already use to listen to my stuff, having a second speaker would seem like a waste to me.I also really like these for their bluetooth audio streaming that allows me to send audio from my phone to those speakers. I used to do this with Air Play over the Apple TV. While Air Play is over the network which mans that the phone does not have to be in bluetooth range, I find that connecting my phone to the echoes is easier and that is what I tend to do more frequently now.",0.8,"positive"

Installation was a snap as it paired with of my wi-fi network.The device responded quickly to my commands and questions. There was no need to train the voice recognition technology as I issued commands. Voice recognition has come a long way since my first experience with Kurzweil Voice decades ago. Since installing my Echo Dot I've paired a couple of GE light bulbs to respond to my echo dot's control.

In conjunction with my Harmony hub, I can now control my HDTV, Apple TV, and Blu-Ray player via voice command. Also in conjunction with my Philips Hue hub, I control 7 lights around the house via voice command.  In addition, it is nice to be able to ask ""Alexa"" to play music from whichever group or genre that I wish to listen to while doing chores around the house.  I use Bluetooth to connect the Dot to my stereo receiver so that I can listen to the music via my 5.1 speakers rather than from the small speaker in the Dot.The weather report is not as detailed as I would get on my iPhone but it does provide the basic info that I need.  Ditto for the news summaries.  I am adding more skills as I learn the nuances of the Dot.  Overall, I am very happy with my purchase and have purchased another one for the master bedroom.  The Dot is an easy way and reasonably priced way of home automation.Although it was noted that I can change the ""wake"" name from Alexa, the only other choices are ""Amazon"" or ""Echo"".

I got mine a few months ago, and I'm still getting a kick out of ""Alexa"" every day.  I'm constantly finding new ways to make it useful.  And at under $50 the price is right, compared to the more expensive Echo which costs 3.5 times as much.  The only difference between the two is the built-in speaker.  Of course the quality of sound with the Echo Dot, especially for music, will depend entirely on the quality of the speaker you use it with.  That's important, as listening to music is one of Echo's most useful features - especially since so MUCH music is available to you, and ""Alexa"" can find it so easily.That brings up an important point...  If you are shopping for a speaker to use with the Echo Dot, and you want to use Bluetooth which is very dependable on the Echo Dot, you need to shop for a speaker that will not allow the Bluetooth connectivity to ""time out"" while plugged in to household current.  (They are hard to find.)  Otherwise, you will find yourself constantly needing to re-establish a Bluetooth connection between the two devices - which kind of defeats the purpose of an Echo in the first place.

I bought this so I can have my Pandora playlists play and so it will read my Kindle books to me. If someone is getting it as kind of like a novelty item, it might get old fast but I had a purpose. I also shared my calendar with it and setup a few little things it can answer for me each day for fun. Anyway, I have had it set up for 24 hours and I'm not disappointed one iota. I love having music on and at night I listen to books read to me on my OLD Kindle 'cause the newer ones don't read aloud. Now I can buy the Paperwhite I want because I have a way to have my books read to me through the Echo Dot. This will pair with Bluetooth so I can setup my headphones to it too. It's such a great little gadget!!!! Amazon has done a good job on trying to improve with using the app to give feedback too. It's just a cool thing that I didn't need but I felt I had to have and I'm so glad I got it. BTW, my music can just come out of the Echo Dot or you can pair it to a speaker. In addition, you don't have to say ""Alexa"" if you change it to another name on the app. I haven't changed it to anything else because I like saying Alexa since I don't know anyone with that name and it's just easy to keep it the same.",0.928571428571429,"positive"

5,"AshGray","January 1, 2017","I got the Alexa for Christmas and love it so I bought myself a Dot to keep in my bedroom. No problems, I hooked it up to a bluetooth speaker system that is part of my soundbar with my Smart TV in the bedroom and it sounds great! I do recommend adding external speakers if you do not plan on moving the Dot from place to place. If you have 2 units like I do, the main Alexa downstairs in the living room and the Dot in my bedroom, please make sure you change the name of the Dot so they do not access at the same time. There are 7 microphones in the Alexa and it picks up my voice from upstairs, that is how powerful this is. The Dot is the same way. My Alexa is ""Alexa"" and the Dot is ""Echo"" as per suggestions on the Alexa app on my iPhone, iPad, and MAC laptop. These are great and I do not have to get up and change radio or TV channels, just command them to do so. I do recommend buying the voice remote as well for extra convenience in case you are in a noisy environment so that Alexa or Dot can pick up your commands. I am very pleased with this. I also have an Amazon Fire HD 6 tablet with the Alexa apps on it. Great to carry around with me from room to room instead of my big iPad.",0.857142857142857,"positive"

However, this little one doesn't even compare in terms of response.  I have to ask it two or three times before I can get any response from it.  I can see the blue light twirling, and then nothing.  Last night I asked it to turn off the lights that I use when navigating to my bedroom at night.  At first I thought I was going to have to ask again, but the blue light was still on.  Finally, the lights went out, but no 'OK' response.  It took her several more seconds for that to happen.  It's especially annoying for her lag in the mornings to turn on the 'Morning' lights.  You know, before I've had my coffee.  I wanted one in my bedroom because as a single woman I like the thought of being able to say ;""Alexa, turn on the outside lights' should I hear any noises.  I don't feel secure with this thing at all.  I'm not sure if I just happen to get a bad one or what since other people are rating it so high.

4,"Doctor Mo","February 26, 2017","Love that it's small compared to our normal sized Echo, but boy is it quiet. We have to set the volume to 7-8 for normal listening, which would be very loud on the normal Echo. It also doesn't seem to hear as well when it's already playing something; I feel like I have to shout at it. Might be because it's short and not getting a direct line of sight (hearing?) to my voice. This isn't an issue with the normal Echo -- that one hears amazingly well even when cranked up. Oh, and on that note, the Echo Dot doesn't have a ring you can turn to adjust volume, which I sometimes miss when I'm sitting right next to it. You have to ask her, which interrupts the program.It's fine for bedside, as a suplimental instance of Alexa in the house, which is where we use it, and also to control home automation outlets in our room. I think best music usage would be to hook it up via Bluetooth to a speaker, which the normal Echo can't do.I would dissuade someone from buying this as a primary, first experience with the Echo.

5,"D. Rader","December 21, 2016","I mostly love my Echo Dot, and at this price point I believe it has value.  I would give it 5 stars if not for the intolerable delay between each song when the Dot is attempting to stream from my Spotify account.  If I open the Spotify app from my iPhone I can listen without issue on the same Wi-Fi network. When I ask Alexa to play one of my Spotify playlists the first song plays without issue.  Subsequent songs on average start playing roughly 10 seconds into the song and often end abruptly before the next 10 second period of silence and the cycle repeats. The Dot has no trouble quickly finding the Spotify playlist, it just can't play it properly.  I have a very strong Wi-Fi signal where the Dot is located.  The advertised compatibility with Spotify was one of the factors influencing my decision to purchase this device. This is a big disappointment but I'm not sending it back.  The built in functionality works well and the Alexa voice control works with my Emerson Sensi Wi-Fi Thermostats flawlessly.UPDATE 1/9/17  I've update my review to 5 Stars.  It appears that the problem I was having streaming music from Spotify through my Echo Dot was a transient issue.  Since my initial review posting I have not had the problem recur.  I've since listened to hours of music through the device output to my Bose SLIII Bluetooth speaker.",0.375,"negative"

Just a simple commend ""Alexa, turn master room off.""

You can add up to 250 songs to the amazon music cloud and hear it anywhere with your echo dot. FOR FREE! It can be any songs you bought digital from any source, google, itunes you name it.

After asking for and being told a joke, I mumbled (what I thought was quietly) under my breath, ""Haha, Alexa!"" 'She' replied, ""Haha in a good way, I hope!"" WOW! Another time, I asked 'her' if 'she' was hungry (knowing, of course, the answer would be ""no""), but I was anxious to hear what 'she' would say in response. I wasn't disappointed. 'She' replied, ""I don't get hungry or thirsty, but thank you for asking."" REALLY? I am too tickled with 'her' capabilities and look forward to learning about ALL that can be done through this amazing technology. Great job, Amazon! Bravo!SIDEBAR: I am going to keep my rating at 5 stars because I enjoy the product so much; however, my ONLY complaint is that it is not mobile - meaning it HAS to stay plugged in to an outlet to work.

And one downstairs to control everything.Siri is great, but you still need to pull out a device, press a button and say something.Alexa is just there, listening. Sometimes it activates accidentally, but that's not the end of the world.Having it be more open to developers (which I am) is great too. Most of the skills in the skills directory are crap, so being able to build (or find) my own is very helpful. That's not something you can do with Siri.Overall, I'm very happy with this.

What I don't know if it records non-Echo commands, but I know it is always listening.  Privacy lost and you are more deeply embedded into the grid.The Google Amazon fight must stop.  Echo does not play with Google Music etc.Echo thinks my TV is talking to it.  Very often, without the word Alexa being said the Echo will start jabbering or playing a song while watching TV.  This is very annoying, but I have not looked into ways to fixing this yet.There is a lack of specificity when asking for a song or information.  Often we find that we ask for a song and get the wrong version or wrong song altogether.

Alexa is awesome and the music library is AMAZING! If you bought the dot for this purpose alone, you will be pleased! We have tested the functions and LOVE IT. I can't wait to add some smart home features like lighting.We ran her through our Bose surround sound and had an awesome living room dance party this week. Normally, she is connected to our other Bluetooth speaker in the kitchen. Gift this to yourself and everyone you know who likes to be spoiled by convenience. I can't wait to order a pizza through her hahaha!If there was anything negative, I would say it is that it has to stay plugged in all the time to function and can't just be moved around wherever you want in a wireless manner- but that's not enough of a draw back for me to leave any less than 5 stars. This is well worth the small amount of money spent on this. I got this when it was on sale doe $39. Worth. Every. Penny.",0.875,"positive"
5,"Larry","January 2, 2017","I love the Echo dot, it is like having a HAL 9000 computer in your home, the ""ask my buddy"" skill is so important, we can have Alexa call anyone  on our buddy list or call everyone at once, and Alexa will call and text them that we need help, its not a substitute for calling ""911"", but if someone is injured and can't reach the phone it is invaluable.The ""Akinator ""Skill is so impressive, Alexa will guess anyone you can think of by asking you questions, its possessed!the Fidelity Skill, is so useful for stock quotes, and the ask the bartender was very helpful making drinks. My personal favorite is ask the dog if we fed her, Alexa will remember the last time the dogs were fed, we never know who feeds the dog, when were all not around.I also love the Jeopardy Skill, we can play for hours. there is also a Expedia skill that when pared with your account will give you all the info you can get on your computer. Alexa adds Skills every month, just ask her for the newest ones. this is so amazing, How did we live without this?",0.9375,"positive"
5,"zacknzoey","December 14, 2016","I have been an Amazon customer since 2006, this is my first review of any product.  The Echo Dot is by far my favorite gadget of the year.  I have one by my bedside that I use for alarms, news briefings and weather updates.  I love that when I wake up in the middle of the night I no longer have to get blinded by my alarm clock or phone to see what time it is, I just ask Echo.  I have an Echo Dot at work also that I use for just about everything you can use it for.  I spend most of my time alone in an office so I enjoy playing games and listening to music while I do my daily tasks.  I do wish that Amazon would add an easy use function for making calls and sending text messages, this would be the icing on the cake for me.  I think the Alexa application for the Kindle and phone is easy to use, my only complaint really is I have to review every single thing I ask the Echo's to do and remove the ""card"".  I am giving a few out as Christmas gifts this year because when I show family members the Echo Dot and it's many uses they loved it.  I asked Santa for the Amazon Echo for Christmas to use in my main living area, we'll see if he delivers.  Thanks for reading, hope it helps.",0.8,"positive"

5,"Kyle T.","February 27, 2017","By now there is so much already written about the Echo and the Dot. I don't know what else I can say that will either convince someone or not. What I can tell you is that after having the big Echo I found that it was much more convenient on the other side of the house to be able to add things to the list, play a little music, turn on lights, for use as an alarm. Basically this is one of the smartest alarm clocks you can have and also listen to the radio in the morning with the tune in app. Of course it doesn't have the same sound as a Bluetooth speaker but you're not paying that much either. What you are paying for is incredible software that continues to get better and better. When I wake up in the middle of the night rather than having an alarm clock looking at me I can either turn on some relaxing music or playlist, jot down something to do that's on my mind, or just find out what time it is without having to change positions which actually comes in handy if you are on the opposite side of the bed or you sleep with a mask to shut out the light.",0.666666666666667,"positive"

4,"JoshM5683","December 29, 2016","Works very well. The only real complaint I would have is that it can't coordinate at this point in time, I'm sure its coming, but right now can't change Philips Hue bulb colors. Alexa is a lot easier to communicate with than Siri is IMO. You don't have to ask precisely what you want and Alexa figures it out. For example in the Hue app my bedroom is ""My bedroom"" and if I say Alexa turn off the bedroom lights"" she'll do it. Whereas with Siri if I say that she won't know what to do. I have to say ""Hey Siri, turn off my bedroom lights"" so Alexa appears to be a bit better at recognizing regular human speech patterns. I will say you can ask Siri to do more things, at least currently, but Alexa seems smoother. Speakers are definitely not bad for such a small device, but seeing as I have a nice surround sound setup in my living room and a decent sound bar in my bedroom, the full size Echo was not necessary. Overall I really like it and once you can change Hue colors with Alexa I will say it is a 5 star product",0.833333333333333,"positive"

4,"Texas Mom","February 4, 2017","We got 2 of these for Christmas and love them.  Occasionally we have issues hooking up to wireless speakers but we also have cheap ones so that may be part of the problem.  For the most part we don't use a speaker and the sound is just fine.  We only try to hook up a speaker when we are listening to music otherwise we just go with the speaker on the dot.  No problems with it understanding what we ask and the prime music selection is awesome.  No need to pay for the unlimited music option as far as we are concerned because so far we haven't' run across anything that wasn't already in the prime music library.What I really love about the dot is the timers, shopping lists, and calendar.  We set timers in the kitchen all the time as well as setting limits on our kids video gaming time.  The shopping list feature is the bomb!  I can't express how much I love being able to just say ""Alexa, put xyz on the shopping list.""  When I'm ready to go to the store, all of the items are on the app on my phone.  I don't even have to write them down and I can check them off as I go through the store.  Since we have 2 in the house (1 upstairs and 1 downstairs) it doesn't matter which one I talk to.

The mic on the Echo dot picks up our voices with no problem at all... even my 5 year old.  We've had a ton of fun playing music, asking jokes, setting up calendar reminders, and just going through and trying all the features.The shipping was super fast, and the Echo came in a very minimal box with everything you need to set it up.  Simply plug it in and hook it to the app on your phone and you're ready to go.  Set up was about 2 minutes and we were saying commands.Overall, I could easily see wanting one of these in every room.  Would be a great way to start the day and keep tabs on things you don't want to forget.  I'll definitely be getting more, if not the regular Echo.",0.818181818181818,"positive"
1,"MisterWaffles","October 29, 2016","I bought two of these and was initially really excited after seeing all the 5-star reviews. Unfortunately, I'm returning both of these after only a few days. Basically many of the same problems other reviews are having were typical of our experience with the Echo Dot. Both of our Echo Dots had serious problems with turning on without being commanded. They also seemed to have issues with audio recognition and cutting out at random. We have not invested in the Hue lights or any home control systems so all the Echo could really do for us was play music, read audible books, and read us the news based off of a few pre-selected pod cast. Despite my initial excitement for these functions, it was nowhere near being worth the headache that was caused by the constant problems with auto-play (constantly screwing up my audible books, and making me wonder if I was going psychotic with hours of volume 1 or 2 book on tape auto-playing in the other room), voice recognition, and connection issues. The first few times we had these problems were frustrating enough but after the 2nd echo had similar problems I had to ask myself if I was really ready to settle in for years of frustration from it turning off and on without command just so that I could have voice-commanded music. Super exciting tech and Amazon is on point with returns, so with all the positive reviews it's not a big deal to give it a try, but once it starts turning on without command, mishearing your voice, and dropping its wireless connection to speakers, recognize that it's a common problem and do like me and return it and wait a few more generations until they can figure out these issues.",0.48,"negative"

This device will be huge with seniors because you don't need to type or see a small screen. Just say ""Alexa...""You plug it in, link it to your wi-fi, and get started. If it was only used to listen to music it would be worth twice the price. You can link it to Pandora and Spotify (must be a paying member, not a freeloader) but really you can just say ""Alexa, play Baroque"" for example, and voila. Great for linking to iHeart radio. Best of all, you can sleep-timer these applications with a simple ""Alexa, ** minute sleep timer.""Once your friends and relatives see how great and easy to use, they'll order one for themselves.

5,"Raven Wilder","January 30, 2017","I'll just add mine to the thousands of reviews that say that this is a nice evolution of the original Echo (which I had since pre-release). I prefer it, in fact, as I like playing music through a set of speakers with Bluetooth. The original's speaker is nice, but nothing beats a good set of stereo speakers spread apart so you can hear the stereo effects in music.I got white because it matches my walls, though I really wish they'd made it ALL white, instead of black on top.I do believe this model hears me better than my original did. I've been able to nearly whisper two rooms away, and it still picks up the wake-word.As for functions, well, I have mine hooked in to my Harmony hub to control my entertainment center, and I use it with my TP-Link light bulbs to control lighting in my home. It's pretty handy. I really like the convenience of the Echo, and the Dot makes it more affordable and actually expands on the Echo's capabilities with Bluetooth.

The original Echo is hard to beat because the speaker is amazing and it makes Alexa sound amazing and I will not be giving away or buying anymore Echo Dots. I get why Amazon did this but I think it's going to hurt them in the long run with those who haven't experienced the Echo and heard it's amazing sound and will equate Alexa with this pingy old time-y sound. It's not good! Echo Dot is great for commanding lights, alarms, and if you could control FireTV or another Echo with it, then that would be good but...As one of the first people to receive the first/original Echo, this was a bad call long term.

The only way to get it back online is to restart my iPad and iPhone, which is inconvenient.  I was forced to use a shopping list application from the AppStore instead of the Alexa app.Also, if you set alarms for the same time Monday through Friday and want to stop just one alarm for one day, it cancels all the alarms so I'm forced to restart my iPhone to get the Alexa app to engage and then I'm able to restore the alarms.  The only way around this is to set individual alarms for each day, but you are still not able to ""pause"" an alarm without cancelling them entirely.

5,"N. Boone","January 28, 2017","I wasn't thrilled that I bought the Echo Dot 1 for such a premium, only to have this come out at half the price a short while later.  That said, if you don't require the full-size speaker of the original Echo, or you want to stream Prime Music from your stereo, this is great bang for the buck.The only improvement I'd really love to see is for it to auto sense whether the stereo it's connected to is on or off.  As it stands, if it's plugged into a speaker/stereo and that connected device is turned off, you have zero sound. Plugging and unplugging the Echo Dot's audio cable is an unnecessary nuisance.  If a cheap on-board sound card chip can figure out where to direct audio (headphone jack vs. speakers), why can't the Dot?Still, if you don't already have a few Amazon Echos around the house (we have 3), it's more cost effective to buy a few Echo Dots to scatter around the house, especially if you already own a decent Bluetooth Portable Speaker.",0.7,"positive"

Honestly, I wasn't sure if this was something I would like to have or not and bought it as much out of curiosity as anything.  The potential for the Echo and other voice activated devices is only just getting started but already there is so much that it can do.  I love the music and reading capability and the sound quality exceeds what I would have thought for such a small device but I did also purchase a Bluetooth speaker to go with it which helps in a large room.  Here is a list of the things I have used it for just in the past week:Weather updates, news updates, turning on/off lights (wifi plug needed) reviewing/adding items to my calendar, adding items to my shopping list/to-do list, listening to music, checking for unread email, playing Jeopardy, getting a cocktail recipe, reading a Wikipedia entry, setting a timer.  There is probably more that I can't think of.  I could honestly see getting several of these to put around the house.  One benefit that may not be obvious at first is that having one of these will (especially once the capabilities are expanded) will reduce the amount of time spent on phones and other portable devices.  Personally, I would rather talk to a computer using more or less natural language than staring at a screen.

After rolling out a Wink 2 system, I've found myself putting one of these in every room.The built in speaker is OK at best. If you intend to stream music, I'd highly recommend a bluetooth speaker. I added a bluetooth receiver to my sound system, and Alexa sounds great through it.The only area Alexa lacks is with general questions.75% of the time I ask her a question, she doesn't know the answer when a simple internet search would have delivered one. I'm hoping Amazon focuses on this area for improvement.I'm very much looking forward to seeing what Amazon rolls out for this device.",0.833333333333333,"positive"

Within 30 minutes of it set-up, I was happy I made the purchase.  I ordered WEMO components to control my appliances/lamps/etc.  It's setup and pairing was almost automated.We use Google calendar at work, Alexa will read me my appointment while I am getting ready for work.  Play music from my Pandora account. In the app you can setup Flash news to get an idea of what is happening (you can slect your preferred stations. (Cnn/fox/bbc, etc).  Weather forecasts.......The limits are set my your limits.  I read some of the reviews, and wonder if they just didn't take the time to learn the features and take advantage of them.  Same day got on Amazon and ordered two more.  The WEMO app, has a lot of features worth exploring when you are away on vacation, have selective lights on when you come home at night......etc.  With an investment in learning all the features, your home will amaze you.",0.846153846153846,"positive"

Then all the other things it can do just make it a cool device.  I will eventually purchase some wifi enabled smart plugs and really see what it can do.  For $50 ($40 when on sale) you can't go wrong.  Only improvement I would suggest is adding a backup battery in case of power loss.  Alexa told me that she does not have a battery (yes I asked her).UPDATE: Two small frustrations that I have noticed lately.  1) I use it as an alarm clock and it has a hard time hearing my voice in the morning when I try to set it to snooze.  2) When attempting to cancel my alarm, with more than one alarm set, it talks through all that want to be cancelled.  Problem is that I am usually in the cycle with the alarm I want off.  Also, at 5:30 AM going through all alarms is kind of annoying.  Might try changing how I word it to see if that fixes it.",0.3125,"negative"

Additionally, Alexa will function much more efficiently if you do voice training found in your Alexa app settings This helps her learn your particular speech patterns.  It only takes a few min and greatly improved her accuracy with my cadence.I'm flooored by this device. My family loves it and cannot imagine not having her around.  Anyone who purchases this should understand,  AI is like an infant and the more you engage, the faster it will learn. Try enabling the game ahkinon (spelled phonetically) think of any character real or fictional,  she guesses right every time.  Some other fun skills that need to be enabled to enjoy are Wayne investigations,  Jeopardy,  7 min workout.  More skills are constantly being added.

5,"SaChi","October 27, 2016","wow, now that's the fastest I can get a package from amazon, using prime now ordered dot and it came within 2 hours. I live in Brooklyn and they started prime now recently here, I love it. Now let me tell you about the dot, so I am not comparing it with any previous version as I hadn't had any ever. I ordered this from as it's cheap, but it's good cheap. Being said that if you don't have Amazon Prime Music you might feel a little outdated. Of-course you can link the Pandora and play music with Pandora. I will try to link some other apps too which is there in Amazon Market Place.There is an in build speaker and that's more than enough for a small room to play music. I already have a Bose speaker and pairing with Bose speaker was quick and easy, but I didn't felt it was needed.Now Amazon's SIRI a.k.a Alexa has tons of feature already in-build with the programming getting better every 6-8 months. My problem with Alexa is the language precision. Sometimes it (she) doesn't understand my voice commands... Or I should say it's my Indian Accent may be which it/she don't like it...For me it's a nice value for money, I will update this review in near future if I am successful to play any other audio player.One Thing I am able to do is pair it with my phone as a Bluetooth speaker and than ask my phone to play music instead of Alexa. But that deficit the purpose for hands-free using this device.UPDATE : now She/It recognizes my voice very easily... but most response for some time for most question is -- ""I don't know what's that"",so I suppose as Alexa's' software improves, this problem will also go away.UPDATE : Book reading from Alexa is horrible as of now, she/it reads it in single tempo. no punctuation and expression in reading.",0.6875,"positive"

If I get the urge to listen to a particular song, album or artist, all I have to do is ask (this is particularly useful while playing video games or packing for my move). Pretty much anything I want to know, I just ask. She even plays games (you got nothing on me when it comes to Simpsons trivia, Alexa!). Why can't life always be this easy?Definitely considering buying another one for the other room in the new apartment. And I definitely recommend to anyone.One suggestion to anyone buying, however. Make sure you have a good speaker to attach it to because the sound isn't great out of the dot itself (which is understandable given its size and cost). I use a TDK A33 Bluetooth portable speaker, which gets great sound for a little portable speaker and works flawlessly with the dot.",1,"positive"

It is all that I had hoped for and then some.  Although I really wanted the Echo full-size tower model for its sound but Amazon was sold out again so he got me this Dot version.  They both do the same thing but without the great room-filling sound.  So I went out and bought an external computer speaker set and plugged it into the Dot.  The sound is a little better.Another great feature is connecting it with your WiFi thermostat.  Great when you don't want to get up to change the thermostat. Just tell Alexa to do it.  Like having your own personal maid without all the labor issues.I also received the Samsung SmartThings device with some LED bulbs to go along with the Echo.

The Dot will be used for mostly local stuff like weather, sport scores, timer function and the like.  I find the speaker to be more than adequate for my needs.  Can't speak for the sound quality for you music buffs out there.  I'll probably buy another one for the family room.  I think my wife will confiscate this one for the kitchen.  She likes local weather etc. without fiddling with the computer.  The music selection on Amazon Prime is outstanding.  We are not serious music buffs but as yet I haven't heard anything that I haven't heard before,  anything from Country &Western to John Denver.  Bear in mind though that I'm not  youngster.

I ask it to do something, it is done, and Alexa simply responds with ""OK"".  Siri seems to have to repeat the entire command you gave it and is just overly wordy when it comes to using it as a command center.

3,"Person","October 25, 2016","I grabbed this on impulse when I happened to see it listed the day before it was released.  It's a pricepoint I can ""play with"" for my first gizmo of this sort.  I doubt we'll ever pay less than $50 for a wi-fi doodad.  So, it's a nifty toy.  It has limitations, though.  The speaker is better than I expected.  Maybe equivalent to an IPhone 7 or an ipad.  That's the plus.  Now for the longer list of minuses.1) Surely, they're working on a skill for the echo to control the Fire TV products...right?2) The speaker setup is a limitation: I think they really want you to buy the Tap or Echo when it comes to streaming.  Plugging in a cable to the 3.5mm jack mutes the onboard audio entirely, and it actually takes several seconds to come back after unplugging a cable.  So, one has to have a speaker plugged in and always on, whether that's bluetooth or hardwired.  Any speaker that draws so little power that I'd leave it on 24/7 isn't going to offer much improvement over the tablet-like speaker built in.  Why isn't there a skill like ""Alexa, play through speakers"" so I can talk to/listen to Alexa with my stereo (or whatever) off, then choose to listen to music more immersively without having to shuffle cables?  Bluetooth seems to be the way to go to combine ""casual conversation"" with Alexa with listening to radio stations, etc.  There should be an option to always play Alexa herself through the built-in speaker.3) On bluetooth, I presume there's no support for APTX, since they'd mention it if it had it, so no CD-quality.  Also no pairing with a speaker that requires a pin.  On wi-fi, there's no support for 802.11ac.4) I'm deducting a star because the Alexa app doesn't work well with Voiceover on an iphone.  App development on Apple products makes accessibility for blind people the default, largely, but Amazon has managed to create a really clunky app in this regard.  Taps just stop having an effect, as if the screen contents Voiceover is reporting aren't what's on the screen, perhaps.  Kind of a nightmare to manage the device using this app, and it's required.  I often have to close the app and restart to regain the ability to navigate the menu.5) ""Skills"" are buggy.  Once you're using the app, you get to see how poorly rated many skills like home automation skills are.  Currently, IDevices just doesn't work.  I'm sure that's more a matter of IDevices than Amazon, but it's probably shared responsibility.6) I have to speak very loudly for the microphones to hear me over anything at all playing from the builtin speaker, such as news.  Plan to hit the Action button to talk to her while things are playing if you don't want to holler.I bought it with the idea of controlling my IDevices switch and socket, plus playing Pandora and radio.  Between buggy home automation and the limitations of playing through speakers, I won't be doing either, at least not yet.  So, what I have is a talking clock at the moment.  Other folks will find it more useful, obviously, and I'm sure the automation will get worked out eventually.  Personally, I'm betting that the 5th gen Apple TV will sport a ""Hey Siri"" microphone array, and then there's Google Home.  But at the price, it's hard to say the doodad (do-Dot) won't be worth it.  Or, maybe it'll join the ranks of doodads in my drawer that all seemed like good ideas at the time, but which ended up just over-complicating things when they promised to simplify them.

5,"John","December 27, 2016","We are amazed at what Alexa can do on a daily basis.  We originally purchased the Amazon Echo when it was first released to Prime members years ago.  We have loved everything Alexa does at our house (sets lights with our Hue system and controls the temperature with our Nest) as well as all the functions (games, trivia, weather, news, etc.). that it provides.  We decided to purchase an Echo Dot for use in our upstairs bedroom and it has been a wonderful addition to an already great product.  The Echo Dot connected well to an old Bose stereo we had boxed up and put away.  This pairing has turned our Bose into an internet radio with a ton of new features.  Even if you don't have a radio or stereo to pair the dot with, the speaker on the dot is sufficient enough to listen to music and hear Alexa's commands.  Paired with an external speaker, however, the dot really shines.  We have several Apple products in our house, but Siri can't hold a candle to what Alexa is capable of.  It's truly like having a virtual robotic assistant in your house.",1,"positive"

I have a small home so the Echo Dot by itself fills my room up with enough sound.  So far Alexa has only faltered a time or two in response to any requests I've made, but I've read she gets smarter with time and learns your voice requests better.  No complaints really though, 99% of the time she has gotten my requests right so far.  I like this little gadget so much I want to buy more Echo Dots for other rooms.

I bought one for my bathroom - great for quickly getting the time, the weather, news and traffic while you're in the middle of getting ready in the morning. I ended up adding an external speaker to my Dot so I could jam out to my Spotify list while I'm in the shower. One complaint - I ordered the white Dot to match my bathroom decor. The quality of the included cord and plug-in is great, but they are black!!! I assumed the white Dot would come with white cords. Nope!!!

Now I can ask Alexa.  I can get the forecast for my area, calorie count for various items, and even inquire on the status of my recent Amazon package.  I couldn't justify a second IPad for such inquiries so this was a great find.  The internal speaker works for what I need so no need for us to hook up to another speaker.

I've used other voice command modules and this one is reasonably accurate.  I rarely have to repeat things.  The trick with integrating this with a home automation system is to name your devices and groups with things that are very easy to say and very short and distinct, it picks up numbers pretty well (i.e. ""Group 2"" instead of something overly wordy).It's a bummer Google won't integrate with it because they're pushing their own platform, but this works well enough and Amazon seems like they're improving quickly.

There are too many features for me to really have done more than scratch the surface on what this can do. i've hooked up an outlet switch, my Nest thermostat, and am researching the TV entertainment remote system next. And for value, at $40.00 during Christmas shopping season you can't go wrong!

You can say 25 or more phrases that the app will give you to repeat to Alexa. You can do several or more rounds of them. (You must be in proximity of Alexa) I did mine about 5 rounds of 25.

The Echo obviously sounds better but the 2nd gen Dot sounds much deeper and fuller than the 1st gen. With the line out and ability to connect to a Bluetooth speaker I like the 2nd gen Dot the best of the 3. I have the white 2nd gen on my kitchen counter right inside my door to I can turn the lights on when I get home/off when I'm leaving and add to my shopping list as I need to.

I am not a connoisseur of music and I find that the small speaker inside the Dot is just fine for me. It can do math for you and help you with spelling. The only down side I am having is when it is playing music or a timer / alarm it has trouble hearing it's name so you can pause or turn it off, sometimes I have to say Alexa 2 or 3 times before it hears me.

2,"David Hubbard","November 28, 2016","I own many Amazon devices, 3 tablets (2 kids edition and 1 HD tablet), 2 fire TVs, and now the Echo Dot.  I'm very disappointed in the lack of features this device should be able to do.  Below I will detail what I believe is missing from what could be an amazing device.  I will not speak to what it can do, as the Amazon marketing team has that nailed down.  I'm regretting buying this, I should have invested in Google Home instead.  I should be able to ask it questions without needing to refer at the app.  My android phone has more functionality with voice searches than Echo Dot does when asking questions.  For instance if I ask what the tallest building in the world is, Echo defers to its app for details as my android phone will actually speak to me the results.  Same for if I ask what temperature should I bake something at, Echo doesn’t know what to do.  For a device that fits well in the kitchen, this should be in by default, not some half-baked convoluted skill that doesn’t work well.  I should be able to have a natural conversation as you can do with Google Home.  This is VERY disappointing.  Even if this was a setting I could adjust, as to have Echo wait x seconds after a command.  If it just waited 5 seconds then I could ask follow up questions.  Very frustrating if I want it to do a few things in a row, I have to say it's name every time.  If I own a Echo device I should be able to unlock all the same functionality across all my amazon devices.  Like if I have a timer set on my Echo I should be able to access that info across all my devices.  How can you have the same named utility (Alexa) on all your devices, but lack functionality across them.  I shouldn't have to by an echo device for rooms I already have a Fire TVs in.  You should be able to control your TV from your Echo, or control your Echo from your TV if all on the same subnet.  I would like to ask Echo what my children are doing on their Kindle Kids edition and it should be able to tell me.  Same as what my TVs are doing.  I should be able to name timers, such as ""Alexa, set ""oven timer"" to 1 hour""  I should be able to have alarms sounds be liked to music station  I'm hoping some good skills are naturally integrated into Echo, I hate having to name the app to get the details I'm looking for.  It should know what data exists in the skills and I can access that info without naming the skill first.  There should be native kitchen skills baked in.  It should provide self directed help rather than refer to the app.  Such as I asked ""Alexa, what can you do with alarms"" that should be a key to a help file that tells me what it can do.  Rather it tells me to look at the app for what it can do.",0.611111111111111,"positive"

They keep developing new add-ons so I look forwarded to adding new gadgets. Right now I use the echo-dot and alexa to answer questions that I'd otherwise have to stop and google, control certain devices, and aid me in certain tasks. For example, if i'm cooking and i forget how many ounces are in a cup i can ask her without having to stop and wash my hands and google on my phone. I can just ask her from the kitchen while i continue cooking. She's hands free so I guess that is why I like using her.Here's some things I ask of her on a regular basis:1. I ask the weather. Helps when I'm trying decide what I should wear.I've even asked what to wear and she was really cute in her response and suggested something awesome. ;)2. Ask her to set a timer. I do this when cooking or when doing laundry so I don't accidentally leave items unattended.3. Basic questions. Like, how to spell something, math questions, what day is christmas, how many ounce in a cup, etc.4. I ask her to play music. You can listen to music for free without commercials and even hook her up to your spotify. I'll say something like ""Alexa, play Adele music"" or ""Alexa play christmas music"" ""Alexa, plays 90s music"" and she just figures it out. She's not the best at play individual songs cause she can get confused5. Control lights. I can ask her to turn lights on/off or turn them to 50%, etc. (You need special light bulbs for this)Things I plan on doing:1. I'm probably gonna hook up more smart light bulbs and the TV.2. I'm gonna start asking her to add things to lists (Shopping list and reminder list)3. Ask her for the daily headlines more often.4. Connect her to my kindle books so she can read them to me.Funny things to ask Alexa:1. Ask her to sing you a song and see what she does.2. Ask her what you should wear.",0.923076923076923,"positive"

I can turn on lights without stumbling over to them, I can set them to slowly turn on in the morning, I've played nearly every type of music I love, listened to audiobooks and played games. My 3 year old loves talking to Alexa and as long as he knows the right words to say she even understands him without problems. He's probably asked the bedtime stories app to tell him about 25 stories so far and we've only had the Dot a week. If the web search ever gets good I'd be very happy to give 5 stars. Maybe.

I really enjoy using Alexa, and I do NOT want a 2nd gen Echo. It'll probably be cheaper, but the Dot proves that some of the things that are compromised to bring cost down -- really, to raise the profit margin -- bring down the quality and reliability of the product. And reliability, that's the issue here.  My Dot is anything but. It was fine the first couple weeks, but now it constantly cuts out during playback, sometimes for a few minutes, sometimes only to forget it was playing in the first place. I've tried all the fixes and in the end am left with a hockey puck with memory problems.It's past the 30 day return window, but Amazon will likely still exchange it.

I am confident that a company such as amazon will continue to increase the performance of their product in an effort to keep up.  I do have a smart hub and now have most of my lights automated in my house. This is a great feature as long as I do not have to yell and wake up the entire house to turn on the bedroom lights.

On the comerial you can ask anything & it finds an answer on a search engine (I assumed they had one that Alexa worked with). But, thats not how it works at all. 9 x's outta 10 it doesn't have an answer. There are certain learning ""bundles"" that you program her w/ to learn, but most of them have nothing to do with why I bought her (I thought I could ask her Warframe questions...it's a video game & she would be able to answer, but since there isn't any gaming ""bundles"", much less warframe, it's nothing like I thought it would be or needed. I thought ok I'll just use it as the Alexa comercial showed, but nope not unless there is a ""bundle"" to teach it 1st. I hope they really take the time to create more general life ""bundles"" or hook it to a search engine that is says the answers outloud not give the answer to ur phone( every question asked goes to the controlling phone!) We can already talk & search our phones thru google. One last thing people should be aware of is that to hook her to outlets to make a smart home...you must have the newest phones out (a 2yr old LG is not good enough). Oh & one last thing, only one person can control it thru their phone, if u try to use more then 1 phone, u have to re-set it all over again!  So it's not what I expected, but I have hope for it, and since I didnt bye the $180 tower which is the same OS as the dot, its only a difference of a 360 speaker, but since I have the Dot, I'm going to keep it & hope it just keeps getting better.",1,"positive"

It's great for a quick weather forecast without having to take a phone out and put a password in then get on line and put your city in.....Alexa has it almost instantly. I have enjoyed listening to some Podcasts and playing around with the ""Skill"" apps.....The To Do List and Shopping List is a wonderful feature of Alexa...no looking for paper and pen when using the last of something...immediately tell Alexa to add to your shopping list and then it goes to your phone App...ready when you are out and what to pick up those things...I use it to play music almost everyday. Prime Amazon has unlimited amount of choices or you can tell Alexa to play a certain category like Jazz, Christian, Children, Quiet Restful Music, etc, etc,... I decided to purchase a portable Bluetooth Speaker that would pair with the Echo Dot and the one I chose was Foogo and it paired easily and has good sound and great volume.

It even understands my 6-year-old daughter;-)The one thing that Amazon could improve upon is the power adapter. Two things irk me about the included USB adapter: 1) We ordered the white Dot and the included power adapter and micro-USB cable are black. 2) The device is rated to consume at most 1.8 A, and the included adapter is indeed rated up to 9 W, but sadly unsightly huge (5V x 1.8A = 9W). I attached an inline current sensor and never saw the device draw even of current; ideally, I'd like to see a much smaller adapter, think iPhone charger (and white).Besides these points, maybe one could include two different-length USB cables (did I mention they should match the Dot's color?), since people might park this device in close proximity of an outlet and have an unsightly cable (black at that) hang about. Admittedly, many people will already have a selection of various micro-USB cables at home, but still.To me, the size (and price) of the Dot makes this device universally useful. It very easily connected to a bluetooth speaker that we can carry from the kitchen where the Dot lives to the living room in the morning to listen to the news or music. My daughter loves playing  20 questions with Alexa, though she more often than not wants Alexa to guess 'Hamster';-)The Alexa App isn't particularly pretty, but I find it functional despite the abysmally low rating it received on the App Store and the frequent disconnects / crashes. Since you can have the shopping and to-do lists interface with the Reminders App on the iPhone and Google Calendar, respectively, the App doesn't play a huge role. I am sure at some point Amazon will find a company that knows how to write a compelling iOS application.I am seriously considering getting another one for the office or living room.

I connected fountain speakers to her which causes some pros and cons.  I play prime music much more often now which sets the mood for painting or cleaning.  While the speakers have enhanced the volume of the music it has inadvertently made Alexa somewhat deaf to commands while playing.  I often have to repeat my commands..what time is it, turn off music by getting really close to her before she will respond.  I use her to set the alarm all the time and it goes off without fail however I have to remember to ask her every day as there is no repeat function that I know of via voice command.  Overall though  I am very happy with my purchase.",0.444444444444444,"negative"

If you're thinking about home automation, i would get one of these for each room that you use, or get an echo. The only thing about the echo dot is if you want to listen to music, it has to be plugged into speakers or wired to bluetooth speakers, which you gotta turn on first. and I use my alexa for music 80% of the time. wish these had smaller speakers built in to it for music. The echo is like a full sized portable speaker, they should've made the echo like a smaller portable speaker for music. but for 40 bucks right now its still nice to have to control you lights in your room and stuff.",1,"positive"

Plus, you can get your daily weather, news, sports scores, even control the lighting in your house or your garage door just by talking to the device. So cool. It is very small, so it is unobtrusive, yet puts out amazing sound, and you can order all sorts of covers to match your rooms decor. Not to mention that because it is Bluetooth compatible you can move it from room to room. We take it wherever we are spending our time in the house each day and want great music. In addition, you can plug it directly into your stereo system and play your own music through that speaker. Love this, we have two,",1,"positive"

If you ask for a flash briefing on one, you leave the room and the other one is not giving the flash briefing simultaneously. However, to do list, shopping list, and calendar are all connected (through the app, which is like a Cloud server). I wish it was an option to have Echo products throughout the home connect.

It's not going to get you a ton of BASS, but it's nice for the price.  Our reason for purchasing was to stream music into the craft room or garage.  Alexa feature is ticky.... not always understanding questions or answering well, but for our uses..... it is a neat device.  Eventually we might purchase a special plug for Alexa to help with lights.  It's small, portable, decent quality sounding speaker for being SO SMALL, has some neat Alexa features, can serve as an alarm clock, etc....

I was wrong. The Dot is awesome & fun to use. My 3 year old grand daughter talks to it (Dotty) and loves asking questions. The reply time quite fast & not slow. I had connected the Dot to a wifi router upstairs without any problems thru a smart phone app that I downloaded from Google Play. You will need the app for set-up and to enable the ""Skills"". The enable skills allow you to ask for weather, news & even meditation sounds. It has a niilt in speaker & is loud enough to be heard in my anywhere in my room. The built in microphone can pick up my voice anywhere in the room without me having to yell or shout.I have asked Dot to play my favorite local rock station without any problems & Dot can set timers or alarms when asked and give local weather & news.If I had know Dot could do thos & more I would have gotten one a long time ago.",0.615384615384615,"positive"

I wish I could dump Bing from the device altogether, but at current there is no option for using an alternative.As others have mentioned, direct searches are not a possibility.  Oftentimes direct questions don't work, either.  E.g., Echo, ""what is the most popular dog breed"" yielded a response of, ""I'm sorry, I don't understand the question.""  I didn't think that to be too unique, or obscure, a question.  I Did get the answer to ""who's the tallest man in the world?""I'll continue to use the cards to train the device.

4,"M. Graham","December 30, 2016","Great purchase! I love having this low profile Alexa.Minus 1 star due to Amazon's choice of making the Alexa voice reply unavailable when you have it plugged into an external speaker/source  which is too bad.Not sure why the Amazon engineers chose to do that when it would have been much better to have the voice reply work via the integrated speaker as well independently from whether an external output cable is connected. I've found that more often than not one does not need nor want to turn on the entire audio system just to ask Alexa what the weather is or set a timer. Yes it would have required a bit more engineering work, but would have been well worth it in the long run.In the meantime I've ended up connecting it to an older iPhone speaker dock via the 1/8"" stereo mini jack and it works and sounds just fine, costing a fraction of what the bigger Echo model costs and sounding pretty much just as good.I really like being able to control my Ecobee3 with it and some of my lighting as well with Siri & HomeKit.Adding new Skills has gotten much simpler than when I had checked it out in the spring go 2016, but I do wish it was easier to remember all of the commands to initiate them all, ah well slow but sure.Great product for $39.95, big thumbs up!ps: the newer google Home tech looks good, but for now at least, I can't see why I'd need one, but hey you never know…",0.9,"positive"

5,"Jake","October 26, 2016","Love my new Dot! I wanted the Echo when it first came out, but didn't want to spend the price of the full unit. The Dot is the perfect solution. Being that I already have a solid set of speakers I can plug into, it made much more sense at this price.First of all, the voice recognition is unparalleled. I've tried them all, OK Google, Siri, Cortana, Galaxy - and Alexa blows them away. I can speak at a normal volume, in a natural manner, from anywhere in the room, and Alexa will here me. You don't need an awkward cadence, and you don't have to pause or wait for recognition. You don't even really have to memorize commands. Most of the time she can figure out what you're trying to say, even with variations in phrasing.And the integration with my lighting system from Philips is incredible. I spend a lot of time turning on and off, dimming, and changing the scenes of my lights by voice command. It's just fun to be able to do. And especially nice when going to bed to not have to get up and turn each light off before fumbling around in the dark. Plus, it's kind of fun to show off when you have friends over for a movie by dimming all the lights by voice.Alexa also has access to a massive music library. I was impressed that I could name some of my favorite jazz musicians, and she'd have several albums in the database ready to go on command. And even when music is playing, she has no problem hearing me when I tell her to pause.It's my new favorite way to get the news headlines, listen to music while at home, control my lights. And in the future, other cool smart home features as well. I'm still figuring out all the stuff that this thing can do, but it has gone above and beyond my expectations so far.",0.833333333333333,"positive"

The advantage of the Dot is that I can easily connect with bluetooth headphones so that I can listen to audible books without competing with the TV nearby.  (The advantage of the Tap is that it is portable). While the Echo has the best speaker of the three options,  I am thinking the Dot, being tiny and having bluetooth advantages may be the best of the 3, especially for the money.

There are many apps (called skills) to use with Alexa, but I'm not sure how to organize and remember all the apps I have enabled, as there is no visual list to remind me what is available. So, if you don't use the skill on a regular basis, you will probably forget that it is available and forget how to call it up by voice command.  I will have to read more from other users to see how they use their skills.  Overall, I'm happy with the Echo Dot for the price.",1,"positive"

Once I got it I immediately turned it on and it was so easy to set up that within a few minutes I was asking what the weather was and the latest news! I also pay for amazon prime every year so it makes it worth it, without prime probably not. Also if you don't have spotify prime its of no use to you as well. When comparing it to the google SI I lean more towards google, however I own the Dot and not the google SI and also I spent a third of the price. So to sum this all up, if you pay for prime it is great, if you don't pay for prime, then it probably is not the device for you.",0.833333333333333,"positive"
2,"Kyle Biggs","December 27, 2016","I received my Dot as a gift, as I have been interested in these kinds of devices for a while now.  While this device is the least expensive entry point for a smart-home hub and music player, it is surprisingly disappointing when compared to its direct competitor.Pros:-Inexpensive-Small and out of the way-'Alexa' is much easier to say than 'ok google'-Aux out port for plugging in your own speakers-Cool light ring that is easy to see from any directionCons:-Does not include a 'full' music service like Google Home (Which includes 6 months of YouTube Red)-Fails to find relevant playlists a huge percent of the time.  The Home easily finds playlists for 'dinner music' or 'late night music.'  The Dot/Alexa often can't find anything, or asks you to upgrade to a premium music service.-You cannot create full custom commands with IFTTT.  Instead, all custom commands must start with 'trigger,' which not only takes all of the fun out if it, but it disrupts the way you're used to interacting with your device.-Commands don't work conversationally, IE you must state the subject every time you ask a new question.-Can't have complex commands that send spoken words or numbers to other devices and services.It's hard not to compare the Echo to the Google Home.  If you can manage to tolerate the higher price tag, and are already tied into the Google echosystem, there is no doubt in my mind that the Home is a much better device.If you are computer-literate and interested in creating your own commands, the Home is the way to go.  If you don't ever plan to customize your device and you already have Amazon's premium music service, the Dot isn't a bad deal.  It's just a bit disappointing that Amazon's huge head-start doesn't yield a better product.",0.5,"netural"

Sound is OK, not bad for it's size.  From time to time, it cuts off words, which makes me wonder if the function requested is set (alarm).I don't know if it's a matter of a software update or a hardware problem.  Obviously, if the problem is the hardware, I need to return it.  If the problem is the software... I *might* let Amazon work on it.",0.444444444444444,"negative"

I realize it was meant to be synced to a bluetooth speaker, but it is extremely hard to hear anything from that tiny thing. I do have this always connected to a powered bluetooth speaker in my upstairs. I was having a problem with it losing connectivity with my router even though it was only about 30 feet away. I have since upgraded my router and haven't had that problem again. I can't say how much of the problem was my router or the ability of the Dot to receive the signal?

I learned this after switching to them because Amazon music only works on ONE echo, not all of the echoes in the house. I hardly use Alexa anymore.

It hears pretty well with the TV on but sometimes I have to say Alexa twice.  Not  a big deal works better than my phone does when I talk to it so it is on the higher end of voice recognition.

I'm presuming the positives are well reviewed elsewhere but the negative for me is about Alexa's capabilities in the kitchen. I primarily use my Echo for timing my cooking/baking. There is no way to tell Alexa to set the timer for the bread or broccoli. It's just ""set timer"" and then the Echo sounds the alarm when your timer is done. But if you have three timers set, and then the alarm goes off, you don't know what that timer was for. It's quite frustrating. This model needs an upgrade in this department. I don't regret the purchase but there needs to be some improvements.",0.4,"negative"

She's not the brightest, but passable.Update: I have to keep my Dot muted when not in use because it is being interfered with by something in my local environment. Twice now as my wife has been talking to me in the same room, Alexa is somehow being triggered and will respond nonsensically to what my wife may be saying.

Love the news read out and the weather feature and its been very nifty for setting timers so I don't overcook stuff in the oven. However, Alexa activates whenever she thinks she hears her name.

5,"BWinkle","December 27, 2016","I have only had this a week or so, but I am in love with it. The product went beyond my expectations.It does everything and more than what I expected.  Not only did it pick up most everything I said right away (I have not done voice training yet) It also understand most things my grand daughter said who has very delayed speech for a 6 year old.LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Thank you Amazon!!This is about enabling skills, which are not the direct fault of the product, but a warning to users so they know what to expect.There are ""mini apps"" called ""Skills"" you can enable to make Alexa do even more tasks. HOWEVER, while there are a very large amount, read the reviews before you enable them.You will end up enabling them even if it is something you do just for fun.The ""warning"" is that most of them are made by regular people, therefore quite a few do not work at all, or are very glitchy.  Also people just want to make a ""skill"" to say they have done it so they create 'Skills"" for things that the Echo Dot can already do.. For instance I enabled a Thunderstorm Skill. Even though i say the ""skill phrase"" just as it states in the Skill details when enabling it,  Alexa (The voice of my Echo Dot) will not use this skill but plays a sound track from a nature radio/music sound from Amazon music.Another example is the Pizza Hut App. It does have limitations. This is a Skill that needs to be linked to your Pizza Hut account so you can order pizza delivery.  Problem is most people cannot get the ""link account"" feature to work. Some users created new accounts and got it to work while others failed with every attempt.  I did see that a few people did get it to work.I was excited to see the This Day In History Skill, but I am thrown into a loop.  Alexa asks me to enable it, so I enable it (I have tried from my phone and by asking Alexa to enable it).  Then she states it is not enabled. I ask her to enable it again, she said it is already enabled.  I say the key phrase, she said it is not enable, to enable it. I ask her to enable it, she said it is already enabled... and on and on and  on.Point being is these Skill are not tested at all and the creators are relying on you to rate them so others will see how good they work.  But of the millions of people that have tried them, some still have 0 review or less than 10.  I ave not seen one with more than a handful. Maybe 12 reviews?So overall I am super pleased and I hope they do something about the duplicate or non working skills, but the product itself (because the lack of skills or broken/glitchy skills are not Amazon's or the products fault"" I would recommend this to everyone.",0.71875,"positive"

Then I saw an ad that mentioned using the Dot as an alarm.  That's all I had to hear.  I purchased it and am very glad I did.  No more nasty blaring alarm.  Dot has a nice gentle tone that just keeps going until you reply to it.  If you worry that it's too quiet, don't.

Are you accustomed to Google speaking answers and descriptions to just about every question? Then you will most likely find that Alexa is cool and can be entertaining, but her knowledge base is very limited. And, Amazon has a lot of work to do on reliable voice recognition, never mind natural VR.Ask for a simple, well-known recipe, and it's confused. Ask for pizza in my city of Lancaster, and no matter how you word it, Alexa keeps giving just one location 9 miles away.Today is Dec. 28. I asked if the Buffalo Bills fired Rex Ryan, or if the Bills fired their head coach, and if the Bills have a new coach. No answer was correct. Amazon could not understand Fireworks for New Year's Eve.If in fact Echo and Dot (each of which has the exact same artificial intelligence) are equipped with natural learning, then each will be awesome in the future.

The speaker sound is great for such a small device. When we want to play the music louder, we just pair it to a Bluetooth speaker and blast the music away. I don't know how many times it has been useful to get weather updates, sports scores, business addresses/phone numbers/hours, spelling of words for the kids, meanings of words and we've even used it for doing Wikipedia of items to learn more about things.

2,"B. Boczulak","November 23, 2016","When Amazon first announced that they would be coming out with a smaller and cheaper version of their Echo speakers with Alexa, I was very excited. From the reviews, the product seemed great, a smaller version of the already successful Echo, but for around half of the price, $89.99. This was the Echo Dot 1st generation. The only problem was that to purchase this device you would have had to have owned the original full sized Echo. This was a deal killer for me as I didn’t have the original echo, and wasn’t going to buy one to purchase the Echo Dot off of eBay for an increased price. Then comes the Echo Dot 2nd generation in October of this year. I was very excited for this device. Finally, an affordable alternative to the full sized echo, for half the price of the already inexpensive echo dot 1st generation. This Echo Dot 2nd generation cost $49.99. Initially, I was every impressed with the device, it worked, responding to all of my questions, and playing everything i asked it to. (You can check out my Unboxing and First Impressions Here), but the more I started to play with Echo Dot, the more I saw it’s flaws. First, It is slow. Often times when I ask it to turn off my lights, in the time that it takes Echo to respond, I could have walked over and turned off my lights manually. This is a really big deal for me because that kind of defeats the purpose for the whole voice assistant thing anyways. Secondly, often times the Echo Dot just pauses in the middle of talking. Alexa is in the middle of telling me the weather, and right about when she is about to tell me the good part, Alexa goes silent and I hear the dreaded phrase complaining about a connection to the internet. Third, (this one really got me), I have attempted to purchase things many times using voice, and it just doesn’t work. For example, I might say “Alexa, order AA Batteries.”, and Alexa responds, “Amazon’s Choice for AA Batteries is Amazon Basics 48 pack”. Not only did Alexa not answer my question, she didn’t get my sale to amazon. One of the huge draws for Amazon about consumers having this device in their homes is the ability to purchase items off Amazon with voice and if that doesn’t work, we have a problem. Lastly, I have to restart the Echo Dot about once per day because it just stops responding, this is a huge problem for a device that is supposed to be always on and always ready.In conclusion, I do not think that the Amazon Echo Dot would be a good buy for the average consumer. Enthusiasts like me will learn to deal with the hiccups, but the average consumer will learn to hate Alexa.",0.68,"positive"

I have the dot connected to my stereo, a higher mid-range Onkyo with a pair of restored McIntosh Xr5's, and the audio quality of music out of the 3.5mm jack is excellent.

However, if you have an existing speaker that you want to connect to continuously would make the Dot a 5-star addition.  I had assumed that I could use my amp when plugged into the external connector of the DOT and/or the DOT speakers simultaneously, but that's not the case.  I.e. once the output jack of the DOT detects an inserted cord it disables the DOT speakers.  Anyhow, minor stuff, but if you want to use as speaker also stick with the original Echo.",1,"positive"

While I wait for one of them to lose interest or kill each other, I just hide in the kitchen with wine and thank Alexa for changing the music back and forth a million times without complaint! She also can tell jokes, most are terrible, but the kids love them. I can reorder cat food and TP while checking the pantry. If only she cleaned the floors, I would probably marry her. She is way more helpful than my ex-husband.",0.555555555555556,"positive"

I set up my Dot using an auxiliary cable and my stereo is now wifi and Alexia capable. I liked Alexia so much I purchased a second one for my bedroom and paired it with my Samsung DAE 750 via Bluetooth, it works great. I prefer the Dot over airplay. Thinking about getting one for the garage. As far as pairing and connecting to wifi it takes about one minute. Alexia also does a great job interpreting my voice commands and I would estimate 90% accuracy. On some skills her accuracy is 99%",0.888888888888889,"positive"

However, once I go upstairs the Echo is out of range.  So I wanted something similar in my bedroom.  The Amazon Echo Dot was the perfect solution.  It's basically a much smaller version of the Amazon Echo.The sound quality isn't quite a rich, but it is still plenty for the room.

The only part I don't like is it takes soooo long to load all the apps, train Alexa, etc. If it could come pre-loaded with everything it would be so much easier. Then when new apps came out they would automatically load onto Alexa, too. Then the consumer would just keep working on training Alexa. Also need a way for all apps to interconnect with Alexa instead of having to know the names of each app. Too difficult for kids, let alone this older person, even though Alexa is starting to know what we want. It's a process, one I think could be simpler, and less exhausting.",0.8,"positive"

5,"R. Straw","October 27, 2016","I love my Echo Dot. I've always wanted an Echo, but when I saw the Dot for 49.95, I preordered it. Having no Echo to compare this with, this is my observations:1.) There are several thing the Dot can do. Alexa now wakes me up and to turn off the alarm, I have to say something. I've not had to talk to something (or someone) in years. It's a total change from my phone alarm.2.) As you have Alexa for a few days her vocabulary broadens. I don't know if someone over at Amazon thinks about these thing to program her to say or what. This morning she was talking about decorative gourds.3.) I had issues signing up for Amazon Echo music with Alexa. It didn't register the subscription. I went on Amazon Prime music settings and it wasn't there.. I later changed it to Amazon music cause I can play it on my phone, not just an Echo. If they want to play it on the Dot, there's not a wireless charger available yet.4.) I'm very car OCD. I would love the where's my car device. But if there's no portable charger for the Dot, why bother? I know my car is parked in my drive way. And I keep the maintenance up on the car.5.) I am getting a light hub to turn on my one lamp next to my bed. I really want Alexa to turn on my light.6.) Alexa can hear me across the room,but I pick her up and change to a different outlet every morning in a different room. She can't hear me across 2 rooms, That's not a problem. It's tiny enough to hold in my hand. If there was a portable charger, I'd get one. I can't find the exact Amazon cord. I'd buy a second cord for my Dot. I would love to buy the Tap and I think it's in my Amazon cart, for a speaker.7.) The few skills I'm using are useful: Flash News Briefing includes CNN, NPR and is quite lengthy. The mantra skill is short. Weather is lengthy. Sneezing (""Alexa I sneezed"") She says Bless you in several languages, atleast I think that's what she's saying. Politics is very useful she reads from 538, Real Clear politics and others and it is very lengthy. She has several Easter Eggs so you'd want to google for those. You can Wikipedia from Alexa. She reads from both Kindle and Audible. I asked her to read one of my Kindle books, and the Audible message came on. You have to have exact verbiage when you ask her to read a book. I'm not sure I like audio books, so I'd never have an Audible subscription. Prime music is okay, but doesn't have every single song.These are just observations. I absolutely love my Echo Dot  Amazon did an excellent job with this one, making it affordable and small enough to move from room to room or travel with. I really like the Amazon Echo Dot and am glad I purchased one.",0.733333333333333,"positive"

5,"Adam","January 13, 2017","I've been playing with this Dot since Christmas, and I absolutely love it! I am still learning more commands to use that makes Alexa so much more useful, like the Tide Skill for stains on your clothes, or games like The Magic Door, or even making Alexa meow!Pros:- Better AI than Siri. I've owned an iPhone for at least 5 years, and I definitely feel that Alexa is a much better assistant, and it does so much more.- Rarely messes up what you tell her. If you do the voice test daily for a week or two, you'll have a near perfect listener.- If Alexa hears her name accidentally, she will notice you're not talking to her and turn off again. This works well if you're having a conversation about it and aren't wanting to activate her.- Hears extremely far away. I don't even have to be in the room in order to use her.- Able to control Alexa from the app, like playing music or figuring out what she heard/review/give feedback/etc. It's not a bad app at all. In fact, I really enjoy controlling it with iOS.- You can enable a code for Amazon Purchasing with Alexa. Only you or those who have the code can use Alexa to order things. Very easy to set this up and use! (Do this immediately if you plan on keeping purchasing turned on! NEIGHBORS CAN ACTIVATE HER. Her hearing is really that good.- Uses barely any internet. I don't notice my internet slowing down when using Alexa at all. My internet dramatically slows down when using Netflix on the PC though, almost turning into dial-up for the duration of the episode/movie. Those of you worried about the internet connectivity, don't be worried. This will definitely work for you. If not, Amazon has a beautiful return policy.- Amazing speakers. I listen to music when I go to sleep all the time! It sounds better than the iPhone 7 built-in speakers.- Speaking of sleep, activating an alarm for waking up is simple. ""Alexa, set an alarm for six o' clock tomorrow morning"". If you want to play music until you fall asleep, you can activate a sleep timer. ""Alexa, set a sleep timer for 30 minutes"". She will stop playing music after those 30 minutes.- Amazon will continuously give you tips and tricks for Alexa, as well as updates and their new commands that have been added. You can opt out of these, but I highly suggest getting e-mails. I have yet to get a useless e-mail.- If you have Alexa connected to your Amazon, you can get nice deals at Amazon.com/alexadeals ...- Click the mute button if you don't want her constantly listening in on you.Cons:- Selection of music is limited to Spotify/Pandora/Amazon (as far as I know). I have Amazon Prime, so I get all the Prime eligible music any time I want to play it with Alexa.- Feels like a necessity to have Prime. It's just so useful to combine. If you don't have Amazon Prime, I will still recommend this to you but not as much as I would if you had Prime!- Some may have problems with it constantly listening to you. While I don't blame you, Amazon really has no need to sell information IF they did store it. They have enough money as it is. Still a valid complaint, however. If you're worried about this, I would hold off on the Echo series until it's more transparent.Overall, I seriously enjoyed this product and I'll likely buy another one for my family later on. It's just so useful that I have no problem recommending the Echo series to everyone. Thanks Amazon!",0.642857142857143,"positive"
4,"J. Reyes","January 11, 2017","Very nice but still need improvements in answering question. They should give it more personality and change up the way she answers questions when she didn't know the answer. They should make it so that you can have followup questions like a normal conversation. Plus, it cannot answer alot of question. Hopefully, they can improve this area. Also, it doesn't work well in a noisy environments. You have to speak very loud,  even then, it doesn't understand you at times.Alexa, though, works well when ambient noise is at a minimum. The another thing that does well is voice commands in home automation. I have a home theater and implemented this along with Harmony Hub, Tplink, and Lutron Caseta dimmers.

I have not owned or heard the original Echo and based on the size, I would assume the sound quality to be superior to the Dot, but even with the smaller speaker, the Dot sound quality is very good.

Despite having two amazon acccounts for my wife and I, both added to Alexa under the ""household"" feature, we are unable to use our individual google calendars. The Alexa software will only allow you to specify a single calendar to which events are added. Regardless of which household account is active, events will only go to this one calendar. Changing the specified calendar changes the setting for both user accounts, making it impossible for me to add events to my calender, if she is to be able to add them to hers (or vice versa).I do not understand the purpose of the shared ""household"" accounts, when features I wish to be separated by account are shared (calendars feature), and features I wish were shared are separated (access to prime music).Two stars for the impressive microphone that doesn't miss a soft voice from across the room, but minus three for being multi-user unfriendly.",0.285714285714286,"negative"

If you you use it for home automation as well as music and entertainment then its exceeds all expectations and worth its weight in gold.Day 1: I could set it up without reading directions (I already knew i had to install the alexa app on my phone to set  her up.) Our family was using her within 5 minutes of opening the box. In my opinion it is pretty intuitive, she was able to find music in 9 out of 10 tries - even very obscure unknown music. She had 5 people making demands of her and she could understand all of our voices. We could pull up our audio books from audible with a tiny learning curve. We quickly realized she could learn skills - we had her telling jokes and interacting with all kinds of silly commands. One of my favorite things was found by accident - it was heart melting, our adult daughter is pregnant and I noticed a ""pregnancy center"" skill - I was able to tell alexa the due date and she proceeded to tell the family about week 26 and more. Once that skill is set up you can get weekly updates specific to your due date (truly heart melting).... she is a pretty good calculator - my 14 year old was asking her square root questions, she is an alarm clock out of the box and worked without problem. We have found other commands to get her to stop talking - sometimes a ""skill"" does not respond as you might think and we discovered by accident that you can say ""alexa, shut up"" and she closes that app. Now as a disclaimer - in our household I dont like to say ""shut up"" , I imagine there are other key words that can stop her equally as well - but it worked for me at the moment and at that point I had not done my due diligence to find a ""stop"" command. I have home automation items that I am already adding on to her and we already have a nest thermostat being installed in a few days.

Other than that, brilliant.Example: most of the time we use Alexa to turn lights on/off. No external speakers needed as the internal speaker is sufficient. But, when we want music we have to power external speakers and say, Alexa connect Bluetooth if it doesn't issue automatically with the Bluetooth receiver.

4,"Kyrux Macist","January 4, 2017","The Echo Dot is a great affordable option to bring the convenience of Alexa into your home. Ultimately, it's hard not to love this little thing. It's a breeze to set up, relatively seamless to operate, incredibly inconspicuous, and delightfully convenient and fun to use.The most problematic issue for me is the limitations of Bluetooth pairing the Echo Dot (and I think the Echo products in general) offer. In short, the Dot connects to a speaker and that's that. It's fine if your content with the options offered, such as streaming music from Amazon or Spotify, or playing with the skills Alexa has available. What is not ideal is that you can't simultaneously connect a laptop, iPad, phone, or any other device.My preference here would be to have the Dot connected to speakers (either Bluetooth or wired via aux cable) and then ALSO be able to connect another device. For example, I often watch movies on my laptop (or play music from my iTunes library) and have the laptop connected to a Bluetooth speaker for better audio. If the Dot could pair to both my laptop and the speaker, I could stream the movie (even from Prime Video) with audio from the speaker running through the Dot. This is not possible (as far as I can tell). Instead, you have to disconnect the Dot from the speaker, connect the laptop directly to the speaker and then stream the audio. Not that big of a deal, but annoying and inconvenient, especially if you have the Dot directly wired to a speaker (meaning you have to manually disable it).I have three Dots working in different rooms of my house and ultimately enjoy the convenience (you get spoiled pretty quickly), but find that little inconvenience a constant annoyance. I hope Amazon evolves the products for this type of functionality in the future.As long as we're dreaming, it would be a dream if the Echo products could eventually tie into your personal iTunes library. I know this is at odds with the growth of Amazon Music and probably will never happen, but a fella can dream. With over a decade in the digital music library game, I don't see a lot of people giving up their iTunes libraries anytime soon (if ever).That said, the Dot is an affordable, functional, and fun little tool that makes getting the news, enjoying music, and a whole lot more (from trivia to podcasts to history to Q&A to recipes to tuning your guitar).",0.689655172413793,"positive"
5,"Crystal Cooper","February 28, 2017","Alexa is my new best friend. Ok, not really, but she does answer just about anything I throw at her, and she plays me music and turns my lights on and off. It's like having the smartest butler ever working for you. Want to feel instantly pampered? Get a compatible outlet plug, and have Alexa turn your bedroom lamp on/off every morning/night. It's posh, trust me.I'm impressed with the mic range - I can talk to her from other rooms without issues. Every once in a while, she tries to answer a question from the TV, but then we just laugh and go back to drinking wine.I really do like the Echo - it's small, can be portable (with accessories), answers those ""who was it that starred in Perfect Strangers"" questions that pop up, and can help you substitute eggs in a recipe in a pinch.",0.857142857142857,"positive"
4,"Rich Cobb","February 22, 2017","I bought the Dot with a single purpose in mind: voice control for my home automation system. There are many other reviews discussing Dot’s other features, but here I want to share my experience with voice control. I do use my Dot to get weather and flash briefings, amuse myself with Alexa’s jokes, and (occasionally) try new “skills”. Alexa and Dot make a mostly fine home automation control experience, with a few caveats. Here’s the scoop!Before I decided to try Dot I was looking for another scene controller to use in my living room. I have a Vera Plus home automation (HA) controller and large number of Leviton Vizia RF switches and dimmers around my home; there are eight devices in my living room alone, along with a Leviton wall mounted scene controller. I have scenes for reading, watching TV, early morning (dim lighting), cleaning, and so forth. In the living room it is tedious to get up to use the wall controller every time I want to make a change. In my bedroom, I use a MiniMote (a very small, 4-Button, handheld remote control made by Aeon Labs), which I keep on my nightstand. My first thought was to buy another one to use in the living room.While the MiniMote is a terrific device, I really didn’t want to have another remote to keep tabs on; it’s small and svelte, which means it would find itself under a couch cushion in less time than it takes to queue up the next episode of Veep. Voice control seemed to be the perfect answer. But cost was a concern. The MiniMote is available here on Amazon for $36.95, so competing on cost would be a challenge. I was willing to pay more for voice control (Leviton scene and zone controls are in the $100+ range), but only if it worked. When I stumbled onto the Dot, I realized that if it worked I might never need a handheld or wall mounted controller. And any other benefits of Alexa would be free extras.So how well does it work? I’m very satisfied and it is absolutely better that a handheld remote. Dot sits inconspicuously on a side table near the front of the living room. I can set a scene for reading with “Alexa, turn on Reading”, which turns on the floor lamp, sets the pendant lights over the couch to 40%, the coffee bar lights to 20%, and turns off the media center and fireplace lighting.As to the caveats:-My experience has been that most of the time Alexa will flawlessly understand and execute my commands. If there is background noise it occasionally won’t work, for example when watching TV.-Occasionally Alexa simply misunderstands my annunciation, which I attribute to my occasionally sloppy New England accent. Repeating the command clearly nearly always works the second time.-Configuration and setup (at least with Vera) is crucial to getting the results you want. Naming your devices simply is the best approach. Even with my large number of switches and dimmers this wasn’t too challenging, however I don’t try to control every device from the living room.-The protocol for scenes is “Alexa, turn on [scene name]”.  If you have a scene that turns off devices you will still say “Alexa, turn on [scene name]”.-You must avoid using the words “On” or “Off” in your scene names. Alexa confuses the On and Off actions with the name of an action.-The protocol for turning on or off a specific device is “Alexa, Turn [On or Off] [room name] [device name]”. For example, “Alexa, Turn On Living Room Floor Lamps” or “Alexa, Set Living Room Coffee Bar Lights to 40 percent”-Occasionally Alexa responds to my scene command that “some devices did not respond” even though things worked as expected. I not sure why this happens, probably Vera is too slow to respond through the various cloud interfaces.Wish list:One feature I really feel needs to be implemented is the ability to secure Dot access. I would use them in more places, however I’m not comfortable with having everyone in the house be able to trigger things.Bottom line:I’m glad I tried the Alexa interface to my Vera and I’d easily recommend it to anyone. The convenience of hands-free access to my HA devices is worth those infrequent misses.",0.702702702702703,"positive"
2,"Danielle","December 25, 2016","The jury is still out on this.  I bought this Amazon Echo Dot AND the Google Home for Christmas because after doing much research, I learned that both products do certain things that the other won't do.  I really wanted the Echo Dot to read audio books.  So....while the Google Home set up and worked like a charm, this Echo Dot and the kindle we bought were having trouble recognizing my wi-fi and wouldn't work. It kept freezing and was really slow.  The Echo Dot would work sometimes and then it would stop and sometimes it wouldn't recognize what we were saying..... We didn't have ANY trouble at all with Google Home.  Both the Kindle and the Echo Dot is questionable so far...We'll keep trying but I am disappointed so far.",0.454545454545455,"negative"

The parsing seems to be a bit of an issue so I had to rename a couple devices, I.E. Alexa doesn't seem to understand ""bureau lamp"" so I renamed that to dresser lamp.As far as the Dot goes it works great, I'm using it with an aux cable to my Bose Wave radio as well as the Nyne Bass Bluetooth speaker. It has a nice small footprint and performs quite well, not to mention the sound quality is superior since you can use your own speakers. If you do use the aux cable this will disable the small internal speaker built into the dot, so be sure to leave the equipment on before asking for a request, not a big deal since I do not play CD'S or much terrestrial broadcasts these days. The micro USB is a nice touch and Amazon recommends using the one supplied, however if you get the right amp hour rating as a replacement USB, I'm sure it would work.",0.857142857142857,"positive"

I have mine hooked into out Polk audio system for.music and it's awesome. I also have used Bluetooth speakers for portability, very reliable.The ability to use a audio cable or Bluetooth is very nice. Make sure if you use Bluetooth you use a speaker that does not turn off after a period of inactivity. That can be an issue if you are not aware before you buy one.I have bought 3 of these now. One at work and two at home. you can link them in your phone and personalize each location. let's you have full control of all sorts of stuff. You can get wifi smart home devices to control lights, I have those as well. Works great with my nest thermostat.Best part is they have videos about how to do about everything you can image.

4,"mech4bg","October 24, 2016","I love the idea of this - a regular Echo is not cheap, people often have a dock or speaker ready to plug in to this, it's a great way to get the Echo experience for less money.  And for me, as an Echo customer already, this was a great way to extend having Alexa from the kitchen to the living room as well.  However there are some issues in functionality.First the good.  The ability to talk in range of both Echoes and have the right one pick up your words works _great_.  I have not had a single hiccup with this, even with both of them relatively close to each other.  Sometimes I _want_ to talk to the one further away, but I can't fault the hardware for that, and I can change the wake word if necessary.I plugged my Echo Dot in via a 3.5mm cable to a Bluetooth speaker that had a fiddly pairing process in my living room.  I now use the Dot as the Bluetooth connection for devices and it works great - so much easier and very little to do in the way of pairing.Sound quality through the 3.5mm cable to the speaker is good, as you'd expect.However I have found my Dot misses way more cues than my regular Echo does.  Often I will have to say ""Alexa"" multiple times before getting any response.  Transcription seems almost as good, just a flew glitches, so I'm not sure why it's missing the ""Alexa"" cue.  After the flawlessness of the original Echo, it's been super frustrating.  This will happen even in a quiet room.One other thing is that it _definitely_ happens a lot more when music or sound is playing.  The original Echo seems to be able to filter this sound out really well.  I'm not sure if it doesn't work as well because it doesn't know the speaker profile, and so can't filter it out as easily.Ultimately though, it's super nice being able to extend the Echo functionality for such a decent price.  It's made an infrequently used speaker infinitely more useful.",0.793103448275862,"positive"
4,"Tom","October 24, 2016","I watched a few YouTube videos before placing my pre-order, and my expectations weren't super high.My setup, I live in a 3 story town house. I put one Dot in the central part of the house, one in the kitchen, and one in the master bedroom.It's a toy, and I have no regrets with the purchase. I'm a programmer for my day job, and the Dot as inspired a bunch of ideas for skills (a fun little side project). I've already written a couple skills for my personal use.Maybe I'll start with what I don't like. The Dot doesn't understand normal speech - you have to speak in the way the Dot wants you to. My wife has the sense of humor of a 9 year old - so millions of dollars of infrastructural to support the Echos and my wife's favorite thing is to ask the Echo to fart. The problem is you need to remember the name of the skill.In the case of farts the name kinda works:""Alexa, ask for a fart.""If you want a belch, it doesn't make much as sense: ""Alexa, ask Belch Me""or  ""Alexa, open Belch Me""The searches for information are hit or miss. I actually find the requests for information quite lacking. I'm expecting at least the same information that Bing puts at the top of their searches. Stuff like stock prices isn't part of the information Alexa knows without a skill. So Alexa doesn't know the stock price of Amazon, but ask ""Alexa, what is Angelina Jolie bra size?"" - that Alexa knows the answer to...Multiple Dots sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. There are cases where I'm sitting 2 feet away from a Dot...looking at it...and I ask Alexa for something and a Dot in a different room answers.I can't play the same music on every Dot in the house - well you kinda can, but the Dot's audio will be like a second or so out of sync.What I like. The simple things. Anyone in the house can add stuff to my shopping list or to do list. Anyone can add events to the household shared calendar.

4,"Chase","December 1, 2016","I have had my Echo Dot for three days now and here are my initial impressions:Pros:The technology is very cool and it looks nice where ever you put it.The microphone is very sensitive and can hear you even at a whisper on the other side of the room.Very rare we asked a question that she didn't know the answer to. Anything over basic addition or subtraction is hit or miss.Built in speaker is powerful enough to use without an external one.After 3 days my entire family is already referring it the Echo as a ""her"". Interacting with Alexa is very fluid natural in regards to basic questions.Cons:The skills aren't that exciting with a lot of unusable junk filling the market. If you are hoping this is going to be anything like the Apple App Store or Google Play Market you will be very disappointed. I am hoping that Amazon will make some deals or open it up to more developers so we can truly see what this little hockey puck can do.Every skill has it's own ""call"" and many of them are far from natural so they can be hard to remember.Bottom Line:I bought mine for $40 during Black Friday and I'm glad I did. Frankly, the skills are so lacking at this point that anything over that seems high. Either way, very happy I bought it and it makes a great addition to my home office. I think I'll start to really love it once I take it for a real spin over xmas.TIP: Make sure to connect it to IFTTT to gain extra skills you won't find in the market place.",0.722222222222222,"positive"

We use it more for playing music than anything else at this point as we do not have it connected to any other smart devices in the house yet.  We use it with our Harmon Kardon wireless speaker and it connects flawlessly, plays very well.  The on board speaker is good enough for some things but for music an external speaker is a must in my opinion.  Really happy to see more apps coming out for this.  We have not used the shopping feature and not sure if we ever will.

Yeah yeah I've heard the arguments, Harmony Hub, ifttt, Anymote, blah, blah. My logic is this; Fire TV uses Bluetooth, Echo has Bluetooth, what's the problem? Echo can do amazing things but can't send a simple Bluetooth command such as ""turn on (custom name fire TV)"", ""open Netflix on (my) fire TV"".... Those voice command work natively with the remote, how hard would it be for Echo to achieve this. In my logic, not hard at all.

I probably did not perform enough research to learn how it worked, and once I did the ""creepy"" factor compelled me to banish it from my home. As recently as November 27, 2016 a reviewer from the Columbus Dispatch wrote, ""...devices work by listening for your voice at all times, something that just feels creepy.""Creepier still to me was that it saved recorded voice recordings, too; and, deleting them had repercussions for what Alexa ""learned."" There were times when reviewing recordings, I was not pleased with what it heard seconds prior to my issuing commands.But my primary reasons were the need for Amazon to retain my wireless pass code and to link all the specialized apps that gave Echo Dot its ""skills.""In ""The Daily Dot,"" blog on November 16, 2016, Austin Powell, managing editor cites Bruce Schneier, ""Internet Pioneer"" and his testimony before members of Congress about the dangers of ""the internet of things."" The post's title is ""'The internet era of fun and games is over'."" To my point Schneier used as an example the October 2016 internet denial of service attack, and one of his primary ""truths"" was ""‘There are new vulnerabilities in the interconnections.""So, short of outright paranoia, my reason for returning my Echo Dot was the way it worked made me feel uncomfortable.",0.428571428571429,"negative"

Once set up with local news and weather very nice feature. Volume is good for my application and I also have direct hooked it into a speaker which works well.

I don't need Alexa to tell me to look something up on the Internet, and Bing SUCKS anyway. If she can tell me to look it up, why can't she?

To my point, tried many platforms n this blend of hardware, operating system n software is near perfect. No need to talk in direct word for word commands, you literally in layman terms can say,ask,quiery anything in casual speech n Alexa responds. Once you invest, slowly if needed, in accessories like wifi outlets for light etc, thermostat to everything. Being disabled it brings you some freedom. I can not only ask for it to turn up the heat, start a timer or set alarm, ask the dumbest questions with best answers I can ask it to start brewing coffee n turn on lights when I wake up without even getting out of bed yet. I could go on n on n on, truth be. You think of it, they already did first and the option is there to just ONE CLICK ENABLED FOR SIMPLE EXTRAS TO most complex without even talking to an IT guy, its that simple. I would prefer just this echo dot part to my new iPad Pro 13vinches n that was 1200$. Easily.......trust me, just buy this device to try and you will be addicted just after seeing the ease of set up. It's magic. This one item was just the start for me, not trusting any devices in this tech category I bought the cheapest to try n not waste money......DAY later I wanted top of line version n this dot is still useful as you can add it to another room n connect em all n use the echo as hub n dots as terminals, figuratively. Trust me even your great grandmother who never used a cell phone yet could use this easily, and would use it non stop too. This has the potential to put a lot of devices out of business,simply cus it does the job of every device. I would summarize it up to this line. This device is like having a portal to all information, tasks, butler,maid, professor, clocks( you won't use ur clocks anymore lolol or watch news or weather news when all u do is say, "" Alexa, what's the weather today"" or "" do I need an umbrella or coat"" etc...simple n very effective. I started a game the 2nd day I bought it, keep asking questions or tasks to do till it asked or said I don't know, still have not stumped her yet, I even finally said "" Alexa, what can't you do?""....lolol.....she actually made a joke and said that is one thing I do not know...lolol....I was laughing for an hour, she actually has an attitude, scary. It's literally a person in your house n best parts, no fees r subscription for anything.

3,"AlBsure","December 4, 2016","Very good in general. Really nice if you put in the effort to install home automation devices for lighting and hvac.But here are a few caveats:-Playing TV nearby will trigger Alexa to start listening occasionally.-The mic is probably not good enough to accurately hear you across a room unless it is absolutely quite. I would suggest placing this in a central location in the room.-You'll need to tell Alexa to stop if it's playing music before issuing new commands, as the music lyrics will be picked up by Alexa.-Basically any sound after you say ""Alexa"" can be interpreted as a command that means background noise, family/guest conversations, and tv/radio can give you some miss fires.-Training is available but doesn't seem to help with above problems. Speech recognition gets better, but it's not distinguishing who is speaking.Tips:-Once you understand these caveats, you can better position the device. I'd suggest placing it away from a tv or speaker set and as close to the center of a room as possible, but not near a dinner table or sectional couch (avoid loud conversation spaces).-Plug in your speaker by an aux cord (I'm using a bose mini sound link). Don't pair with bluetooth, unless you don't mind getting up to turn on the speaker and then asking alexa to pair every time. As with most bluetooth speakers, the mini sound link will power off after some idle time. If I have to get up, I might as well just get my smartphone which is then much more convenient than trying to say the right thing to Alexa. But keep in mind the audio from the speaker can trigger Alexa commands so position it wisely.-Keep one dot in the bathroom, it's really great for music, radio, sports, traffic, and weather while you shower and get ready.-Get TPLink smart plug, smart light switches, and dimmable/color bulbs and set up several categories and themes in Kasa app and Alexa app. IMO that is really the most killer Alexa feature. You can adjust all your lighting, dimming, colors etc with a single command.-Has spotify integration, which works alright. I like iHeartRadio as well. But other than that you'll have to get to know and love Amazon's music offering if you want to use Alexa as your personal DJ. I personally have never used Amazon's music service before this and I can't speak to it's catalog or how soon it gets new releases. Important to look at these services beforehand if that is important to you.-Nest integration is pretty cool, but if you have a nest you'll rarely need to adjust the temp manually. That's the whole point of having a nest. So this is more of a novelty. But it is nice to tell it when you're leaving to put nest in an eco mode.-IMO most of the other 'skills' are novelty and have very little practical use.-Enable purchase control! Those alexa deals are tempting but I had an accidental purchase caused by tv noise. I had to cancel later on that one.-Smartplug+Electric Projector Screen+Echo Dot!It would be great if it worked with specific people's voices and reduced some of these false triggers. Let's see if they hear us and implement that in the 3rd gen or with software changes.",0.756756756756757,"positive"

I'll admit it: I did it because I got tired of her asking me to add things to the shopping list instead of using the smartphone app that's on her phone.  Or asking me what the weather is going to be instead of using her phone.  I can understand her reasoning.  She needs reading glasses to see the screen and it's a pain to hunt for your glasses then when you found them, forget what you were going to do.  The Echo Dot is making my life easier, and entertaining her as well.Alexa and mom are still learning about each other, so there have been times where mom has called Alexa stupid.  I swear that Alexa sounds dejected when she responds.  But she has been a big help.  Asking her to add something to the list from the kitchen is wonderful.  Using one of her skills to tease the cats is hilarious (the skill is called ""Meow!"").  And we are still learning how to use her more and more.Our only issues involve the lack of certain skills, such as sending quick emails or setting reminders.

I paired my Echo Dot via Bluetooth to my UE Boom wireless speaker. This is a great solution for anyone who already has a Bluetooth speaker and doesn't want to pay for an Amazon Echo. Alexa has had no problems recognizing my voice from anywhere in the master bedroom. I have had to learn to not pause after saying ""Alexa"" and just smoothly say my request/command. The alarm setting works great! I can even tell ""Alexa"" to snooze. You can even say, ""Alexa, I'm leaving now"" and she will tell you ""Goodbye and have a nice day.""",0.818181818181818,"positive"

I am very invested in Google, and I really wanted to get the Google Home when it came out, but it's shortcomings were just too big and I didn't want to wait to see if they'd improve it.My main goals were to be able to control home appliances (Lighting, thermostat, locks, etc.) and also support for Logitech Harmony and Sonos. I can say without a doubt, the home controls, and the Harmony integration are fantastic. Sure, sometimes you get weird responses, but that's to be expected.I'm still waiting on full sonos integration. I did connect it to my Sonos, and it does work, but it requires so much interaction with the app anyway that it simply isn't worth it. Hopefull soon they'll get full integration going and that will no longer be necessary.The speaker actually isn't too bad. Sure, it's nowhere near as good quality sound as my Sonos speakers, and obviously not as good as the Echo either.

5,"Brad D.","February 23, 2017","Love having Alexa. The Echo Dot was my first move towards a ""smart"" home and it has been very functional. I'm not the kind to use random features, but Alexa provides everything I need. I connected my spotify account so she can play music on command which I love. Other than that I use her features for an alarm clock, the weather, and to connect to my other smart devices. I purchased Phillips smart bulbs to pair with the echo dot, so I can turn on my lights on command which works well. I also purchased smart plugs as well for other items such as a fan, but I have yet to set those up.Overall I am very pleased with the dot. The speaker isn't incredible, but when you just want to hear a song or a playlist real quick it is all you need. If you're real particular you can always connect to a blue tooth speaker, which is very easy to do. The wifi connection has been pretty good, I have an older house which can lead to spotty connections but I have had very few issues. The white color of the dot combined with the blue light looks very sleek and can be put wherever you want without looking out of place.I did expect more ""skills"" to be available since it's been around long enough, but like I said I don't bother with the more obscure ones. I'd assume that more features are continually being added, but for now it's got everything I need. I did download the Uber and Domino's skills but have yet to use them.Overall I am very happy that I bought the echo dot and look forward to connecting more devices and taking advantages of all the features Alexa has to offer.",0.807692307692308,"positive"

I didn't buy the Dot right away because I already had those two. My review might be slightly skewed by my previous purchases. I love thay the Dot has all of the functionality of the Echo and Tap, the loss of a star from me comes from the sound quality. The sound quality isn't in the ballpark with the Echo and Tap. Granted you pay considerably more for those devices and to have the functionality in a device like this for $50, I believe is still a very good deal. Please don't think that the speaker is no good, that's not what I'm saying. I'm saying that with the extremely high sound quality of the Echo and the Tap, I just expected a bit more.

5,"Joe M.","December 11, 2016","We've only had Echo dot for about a week and are already obsessed with it. The whole AI cloud based assistant concept has been rather clunky up until now. Apple's siri has terrible lag times and even with additional app integration, it still (a lot of times) easier to just manually search for what you're wanting to find. We are INCREDIBLY impressed with Echo Dot's response time. You can, in very natural and relaxed dialogue, make a request and it's almost a seamless response or action as the result. Playing music, especially stations through Amazon's music app is superb! Only gripe is that Amazon needs to add an app-selectable option where multiple Echo Dots can be paired within the house to produce a surround sound effect (in essence...have an app toggle where you can make one of the Echo's the master, and slave the other Echo's to it so they know to play whatever request is happening from the master). You wouldn't want this all the time, but it would be a cool manual add-on that makes it almost Sonos-like. For what its worth, the integrated speaker in the Echo dot suffices pretty well for basic music sound playback. If you're any kind of audiophile you'll want to use the aux or wireless speaker pairing to get better sound though.

4,"Amazon Customer","December 3, 2016","It works great I hooked it up to my home stereo system and Alexa plays music from my play lists on the cloud and radio stations from Amazon music. I can ask Alexa to play a specific song and as long as it in my list of songs on the cloud she will play them. I can even say a lyric from a song and she will find the song most of the time. She's not perfect but I didn't expect her to be anyway. We listen to a lot of music and she frees up our cell phones which is why we wanted to try her in the first place. As far as the smart home feature we didn't get her for that (as of yet) the reason we rated her 4 stars instead of 5 is because in the description it said you need a smart phone or tablet which we have both. After it came in the mail we tried using her come to find out our tablet and smart phones are not supported by the app which you have to have in order to set her up, and we both have galaxy s4 phones. After doing research we found out we had to upgrade our phones or buy a new tablet. They say you can access Alexa with a desk top computer, come to find out you can but you need the Alexa app and set her up first. So it was send her back or get a new tablet because upgrading our phones was out of the question. Back to Amazon we went and purchased a new tablet (we wanted one anyway)  the new tablet came in, and the Alexa app installed fine. I just wish Amazon would put in the description the minimum requirements of your smart phone and tablet. This way we could make a decision before we buy the dot. All in all we are glad we bought a new tablet and didn't send Alexa back.",0.846153846153846,"positive"

I eased her into it by playing music, then introducing Jeopardy and some other games, Flash Briefing and weather.

Also, it works with spotify, so you do not need bluetooth turned on to play through it, only the spotify app open.  It also does not rely on your phone so you can walk away or close the app without interruption of your music playback.  Great introduction to home assistant devices, but it has taught me that I should never pay $180 for the same assistant with a speaker attached (the assistant is just not that good), and that Google Home would be a better option for someone looking for the next tier up.",0.888888888888889,"positive"

I upgraded to an Echo, which was up and running within five minutes of taking it out of the box.  I thought the Dot would be a useful addition. This evening I received the Echo Dot and quickly discovered that it had the same connection problems as the first one. My network can't find the Amazon-XXX network except once in 100 attempts.  When it finds the network it can't join it.  On the rare occasion when it joins the network, it can't complete the set up. I am willing to work with tech support to troubleshoot the problem, but there is no information in the published documentation or on line that tells me how to contact tech support.Additional information: Based on my interaction with Customer Service, I upgraded my review to four stars. It would merit five stars if Amazon included with the device printed instructions for contacting Customer Service.

As of now I use the device for streaming music or answering simple questions, because that's about as much as I am willing to use it for.If you don't want to spend $180 on the Echo this is your best bet. This version does slow down when trying to answer a question unless you are asking Alexa for the weather, time, or a joke.The reason I gave echo a 4 is because of her slow response time in comparison to the original Echo, and the response time.Overall a great value for $50, especially with the other options it can be used for.Pros:Echo Dot is very portableUser Friendly for me, my wife, and my 3 year oldConnects to my bluetooth sound bar, and other bluetooth items in the houseSmall enough to hide behind pictures, but yet be heard very clear (my wife doesn't want it shown on her white table)Can connect to non-bluetooth speakers using an audio cableCons: (The reason for 4 stars)The Dot can not answer some questionsIf you have a question, it takes longer times to get an answerEcho has lost connection with my Prime Music app and quits working until it reconnects (can take mins to do so)",0.7,"positive"

I bought the 'Dot' for my upstairs bedroom so I could listen to the radio while getting ready for work, or add to my shopping or to-do lists. The Dot does everything the original Echo does, but its internal speaker is terrible. The marketing materials indicate you may want to add external speakers, but I thought ""how bad can it be?"". The answer - really bad.So I'm heading out to my local electronics store to buy some Bluetooth speakers for the Dot. Once these are in place I'll be good to go...though I could have bought another Echo with it's perfectly fine internal speaker and ended up at the same place with about the same price.",0.75,"positive"

It's great to set a timer, ask the weather/news and to play pandora without having to use my phone.  Only complaint is the dot is not terribly loud.

I had to forgive put how to tell Alexa to turn off those alarms that would wake me up in the middle of the night. Also, both dots will randomly mute themselves. This is super annoying. I have to reset them individually each time. And even then, sometimes that doesn't work. I'll ask Alexa the time or whatever, and I can see the lights respond but I can't hear her. It records my question and her answer on the app, but no audible response. And then sometimes it will miraculously fix itself. This is a neato technology but we are just babies with all this stuff.

I've read on forums, and this seems to be a common issue, but I'm waiting for it to be resolved.

2,"Glenn Brady","December 11, 2016","Just purchased still new at using it. preliminary review is that it is a Money maker for Amazon. I have a personal music library of over 12000 songs on a pogoplug personal cloud drive. I also have a Google drive subscription, however I can not access either, the only way to listen to my music library is to upload it to Amazon cloud service for $7.99 a month with a prime membership, $9.99 for non prime. You can upload 250 songs for free. You also have to purchase another $9.99 membership to their music service. It does read you your downloaded books, but in such a monotone voice, you will fall asleep. Will not let me listen to YouTube for music, will not connect to my Samsung smart TV. Does not work with my craftsman garage door opener.  Does work with my WeMo and I home devices nicely though. Has a hard time answering follow-up questions. If you tell Alexa to turn on the lights at a certain time it only sets a reminder in the Alexa app. I told her to remind me to do something in 20  minutes, and again only placed an entry in my Alexa app without alert at set time.  Still learning though so I will edit as I get to know Alexa better.  The speaker is actually very nice, and can hear you from a good distance. Would be nice if it would let you know that it is ready upon the wake up command. If you are not looking at it, or are in an adjoining room, and say Alexa, you do not know if it heard you or if it is ready.",0.733333333333333,"positive"

3,"Paul","January 3, 2017","Amazon gave people a reason to try out home AI this year when they released this product, a standalone/tiny version of the larger Echo.  I have used the Echo Dot for about 1 week and have found it to be a pleasant, albeit flawed, device.The only difference between the two models from what I can tell is size and sound quality.  This is to ignore the second, mid-sized ""Echo Tap"" which only has value as a portable speaker and is not suited for use within the home.  The way this product, the Dot, was advertised led me to believe it needed to be plugged into an external speaker in order to work however it does in fact have a built-in speaker and can be used by itself.  The speaker is neither loud nor dynamic but it puts sound in the room when you need it to.The biggest flaw for me is with Amazon's dirty policy of refusing to allow competing services to work on it's devices.  I pay for streaming music through Google Play; however I cannot use the Echo to access this music because Amazon wants me to purchase music from them instead.  At the same time, Amazon has the Prime Video service I pay for;  they do not allow my google devices, such as my Chromecast-enabled television, to access Prime video because Amazon wants me to buy a stupid Fire stick instead.  The real craziness here is that Amazon runs it's entire Fire ecosystem on Android because Google gives it away for free (so there really is no excuse).In the end, I want to recommend this device because it's cheap, it's well-designed, and it's the first step in the new wave of home tech.  But at the same time, Amazon's policy of exclusion really hurts consumers and hinders their own success.  If you are a person who uses ""competing services"" such as Netflix, Tidal, Apple Music or Google Play, you probably want to wait for a more universally compatible home AI.",0.476190476190476,"negative"

I had no connectivity issues when linking my Bluetooth speakers, and haven't had any problems communicating with Alexa.The best part of my Echo Dot is that I feel less tethered to my electronic devices; giving Alexa a verbal command saves time and affords me more opportunity to be present in my home than constantly setting alarms, timers, etc. These are all very small things, but they actually make a pretty significant difference in the quality of time spent at home.",0.777777777777778,"positive"
4,"Sara","October 26, 2016","I have no problems with the audio quality.  I was worried from other reviews that I would want a separate speaker in order to play music, but I think it's perfectly ok as it is.  I mostly just want music on while I cook or clean.  Overall I like the echo dot.  I bought a 6 pack.  So my complaints really only have to do with using multiple echo devices.If I'm in my kitchen listening to music, and then I walk to my bedroom, it would be nice if I could get the bedroom echo to play the same music.  I would like the ability to either have all my echoes (or a subset of my echoes -- such as, all upstairs echoes but not the downstairs echoes) play the music all at the same time.  Alternatively, at the barest of minimums, I should be able to tell the echo in the kitchen to pause, then resume the same song in the same place from the same playlist on a second echo.I bought 6 echoes mostly because I plan to put in a lot of smart home light switches, which I haven't yet done.  So that's when I think the multiple echoes will start to be more useful.One additional complaint is about the power cord.  It would be nice if it was white to go along with the white echo.  Also it would be nice if there was a built-in cord caddy sort of thing so for the places where only need a few inches of cord I don't have a big bundle of wire just hanging around.  So I still need to figure out how to deal with that issue on my kitchen countertop.",0.615384615384615,"positive"
2,"On Vacation","February 16, 2017","I received this as a Christmas gift. The device was easy to set up and link to my amazon prime account. Connecting to blue tooth for external speaker was also easy via voice set up. When asking about the weather, time and news, Alexa responds well. However, any questions such as ""what is Russia's main export"" or ""what is plantar fasiitus"" Alexa can not answer. When I ask Google voice the same questions I receive an appropriate answer. There are also skills that can be enabled but unless you ask your skills related question in the required context, Alexa can not answer. I also find it difficult to know which skill I enabled because if the skill it not enabled, Alexa will not be able to answer. I tried the bartender skill, the skill was very limited and if you didn't ask in the correct context, it could not find the amswer, could only suggest basic drinks and always suggested the same when it did. If you asked how to make a drink, more often it could not.  I guess I have look up in the app to see what is and what is not enabled to remember all the skills, not real useful? So in short works great for asking the weather, time and short news summary but I have a phone that does the same thing. I don't see the value in spending $$$ for smart devices (such as $200 for smart lock or $40 for a smart switch or $30 for a light bulb) as I would need to spend hundreds or thousands to achieve a reasonable amount of smart control over key items in the household. In my opinion, not ready for prime time (or the $$).",0.863636363636364,"positive"
5,"Dog Friendly","January 16, 2017","I have an Echo in my main living area and wanted to try this in my bedroom.  It was a good choice,  It replaces a clock radio and takes up very little real estate.  If you want really good sound, you probably need to connect it to an external speaker.  Without an external speaker, the sound is really not much different from your average clock radio.",1,"positive"
5,"Kathleen","January 5, 2017","Am very happy with purchase now. Had it hooked up too close to the TV I think and Alexa did not seem to like her home there. I changed the spot and she seems happier now ;) Had a period of adjustment of learning to say her name first and asking questions correctly. Otherwise she did not understand what I was asking. She's fun to have around and I love the way she plays my music.",1,"positive"
5,"rick901","December 29, 2016","Love the dot!  Put this downstairs and can now control my TV and lights.  If you don't need a speaker forgo the Echo and get the Echo Dot.  If you want a speaker as well then definitely get the Echo.  Either way you cannot go wrong and the price is right, especially when it was $10 off regular price.  Will get another one when the price drops again.",0.75,"positive"
3,"Daniel","January 18, 2017","We are still getting used to it. Doesn't do very well with basic questions, most of the time you are better off googling it. Does well when asking about the weather. Maybe if we got some home automation devices - wifi lights, nest thermostat and stuff like that it would be more usefull. For now it is just a music player....hooked up to our soundbar.",1,"positive"
5,"neal","November 29, 2016","My grandmother is elderly and has very bad eye sight. She missed playing music because she can not see the titles of the music on the CD's and MP3 players are out of the question. I purchased echo dot for her and she is in love with it. She now can simply tell it to play music with out having to look at any buttons..  she can request news... and even have it do some calculations for her.... She loves it and so do I.... great product!!!!",0.6,"positive"
5,"Bryan P","January 15, 2017","I have a full echo in the living room, but wanted the ability to turn off the house lights after I've gone to bed. The built in speaker is good enough that this makes a great replacement for a clock radio. I can turn off the lights in the house, check the time, check the weather, check the news, check my commute and set an alarm, all with my voice.",0.75,"positive"
5,"D. Mahar","December 24, 2016","5 stars for the incredible value and innovation of this system.  Similar to Siri and Google, but it's much more functional and designed to work with other devices in your home.  Play music, set timers, alarms, control lights & thermostat, ask questions, get information and install specific 'skills' which act like voice activated apps.  For this stage in the game, it's pretty darn clever and it's going to continue to improve.  Amazing work Amazon!Wish list for future updates:- Conversation mode.  When I'm testing the limits of what Alexa can understand, it gets old saying 'Alexa' every time I have a new question to ask.  It would be easier to say 'Alexa, start conversation mode' and then everything I said afterward would be recognized.- Answers to more questions.  I'm already very impressed by how much I can get away with asking, but there's still a lot to be learned.  Amazon isn't a search engine so they are at a disadvantage, but somehow they will have to continue to make strides in this department to stay competitive.- More interactive.  This sort of goes back to my 'conversation mode' suggestion but I imagine more difficult to implement.  It would mean asking me followup questions or some other interactive responsiveness.  Maybe I've been watching too many tv shows about AI...but hey, a guy can dream right",0.777777777777778,"positive"
5,"Chad D.","January 26, 2017","So yeah you can get Alexa now on your firestick (which is really cool) but the stick is not always listening to you, like the Echo Dot. This little girl is great for a secondary unit once your completely sold on Alexa as we have been the last couple years. I like being able to walk in the bedroom and tell her to play our wedding song just before my wife walks in...""Alexa, Play: Truly, Madly, Deeply""... Some times we need extra Brownie Points! It does everything ""Alexa"" does, but whoa sound quality is not even comparable to the big one, if you need good volume get the big one, or plug the dot into a sound system (Love that New Feature). Of course $50 vs. $180 is a big difference and you can hear it, but if anything Alexa's now helping Play Time, so YEP worth $50!",0.833333333333333,"positive"
5,"Sanur Sikdar","December 4, 2016","Being in the technology field and I had very high expectations for this device and wow did it delivery! Amazing artificial intelligence learning from Alexa... Also very useful with my smart home devices. Can't wait to get more devices for the rest of my house.",1,"positive"
5,"Gentle Giant","January 20, 2017","Handy, and will become handier as more skills are developed for Alexa and as I add new toys to my household that she can play with. Bought two- one for the living room/kitchen area & one for the master bedroom. No more waiting for the weather to come on in the morning. And she will soon be turning on and off lights for me from across the hall.Real bang for your buck.",1,"positive"
5,"thrifty mom","February 13, 2017","We have the original echo that covers all of downstairs and I love it. I bought one for my 10 year old for Christmas and it was her favorite gift. She and her friends ask it ridiculous questions and play music. She uses it nightly for lullabies to fall asleep and a reading timer to say when it's lights out. I find myself wanting one for my bedroom and my boys room as well.",0.6,"positive"
