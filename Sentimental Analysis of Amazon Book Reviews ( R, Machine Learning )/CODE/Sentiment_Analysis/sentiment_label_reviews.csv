"I gave this drive to someone as a gift and theyve been using it for backups for  months without issueMy review is based on another unit of this drive which I bought for myself some months later  Ive been using it as my primary desktop OSprograms drive since  so its about  months now  There have been no problems thus far  Its really quite a bargain for desktop use if TB is all you needThe actual capacity of this drive is GB Thats an old marketing trick which can be blamed for the pointless redefinition of all our real long established data measurements with those silly i characters I wont dwell on it any further but GB is the true capacity when measured in base  as all data is correctly measuredThis TB Blue drive uses a single TB platter spinning at rpm  There are  heads each side is GBA single platter design is usually better for reliability than having multiple smaller platters because there are fewer points of failure the assembly is lighter the motor doesnt have to work as hard and less heat is generatedSingle platter drives will also tend to be quieter but due to my configuration I cant judge the noise levelThere has been much discussion and testing among users in online forums including WDs forum which repeatedly show that the TB Blue and TB Black perform the same It appears the only benefit of the TB Black is a longer warranty Some Blacks are faster than this drive but the TB model is notCompared to a Green the Blue is faster owing to its faster rotation speed  The Green drives also have an intellipark feature which causes them to keep parking the heads after a few seconds of inactivity  This can cause laggy response and extra wear  I dislike that design  I believe power management functions should be left under the control of the operating system which can account for user preferences and what is happening in the rest of the system  Hardcoding this behavior into the drive is ridiculous in my opinion  The Blue behaves the way I prefer  it does not use intellipark it stays ready to roll until directed otherwise through power management commands from the OSI wish they were making the Blue series in larger sizes  it seems this TB is the end of the line  I dont care for the Greens and the Blacks are more expensivePartitionSector AlignmentPlease be aware that like most modern drives this drive uses KB sectors also known as advanced format  If you are using Windows  Windows XP or older as I am dont let Windows handle the partitioning of this drive  This is even an issue on unpatched versions of Vista and Windows   These older versions of Windows will believe that the physical sectors are  bytes when in reality they are KB  As a result the partitions will not be aligned with the physical sectors  It will still work but performance will be reducedWindows Server  and Windows XP and older do not have any update to fix this but its not a problem as long as you do the partitioning with a suitable rd party utility  I think Western Digital offers a tool for this but Ive never tried it  Once the partitions are set its fine to let Windows format themFor my Windows XP install I used a recent version of GParted to partition the drive  GParted can be downloaded and burned to a bootable CD or installed to a USB flash drive  Just use the option to align your partitions on MB boundaries  This is the easy way to ensure they are aligned correctly for the best performance  Then boot your WinXP install disc and let it format the partition that you already created  It sounds harder than it is its a minor hassle but its simpleIf you ever change the partitions once again use GParted or a similar utility that handles alignment for modern hard disks  Dont use the builtin XP partitioning  But again once the partitions are created its fine to let Windows format themThe builtin partitioning is fixed in Windows According to Microsoft it is fixed in Windows  after installing Service Pack   you would need to have that service pack before partitioning the drive not afterAgain according to Microsoft it is also fixed in Windows Vista after installing update MS KB   I assume this is automatically installed for people who use automatic updates but I dont know that for a fact  This wont do you any good if youre doing a fresh install and your install disc predates the required updateThe partition alignment detail Ive described above is an issue you will encounter with any recent hard drive its not unique to this model  If you ignore it performance will be affected but it will still work  You may see Seagate drives implying that they are immune from this but in reality they are not  All modern advanced format drives of any brand will perform better if sectors are properly aligned  But its not a big deal  just use a modern partitioning utility and then youre setI just tested this drive using Roadkils Disk Speed on Windows XP bit  Ill cut out all the variables and just give the linear transfer results with large block sizes  My drive has a few partitions and there are lots of files on it so this might affect resultsFirst partition first GB  MBsec linear readrd partition physical location range is from GB  MBsec linear readLast GB is unpartitioned so I cant test that rangeI dont think the random access test is useful because my partitioning greatly influences the resultTheres a test mode for the whole physical disk but its results are too inconsistentThis drive is a great bargain if you just need a simple inexpensive well performing rpm hard disk  I was tempted to try a Seagate SSHD but I couldnt justify the cost compared to this  If I was shopping today Id look carefully at the HGST and Toshiba offerings as well but from the WD side this is my pick for a general purpose TB desktop driveUpdate It is now   This drive is in my desktop PC used daily and still works fineSome months ago I ran a benchmark on this drive using the linux utility gnomedisks  The random access performance measured out to a ms average This is mediocre but expected from a quiet drive Screenshot is attached It also shows the transfer rate across the disk read test only I didnt test writes",60,"positive"

"I had recently purchased an external hard drive case that is usb  and I used an old Seagate TB Barracuda I had laying around to expand my sons hard drive on his xbox one Unfortunately the old seagate didnt stand a chanceIt worked for a few weeks and then I got the dreaded TICK TICK TICK noisehard drive platter was ruinedNot sure what happened Anyway I already had the  enclosure with fan so I opted to get another bare hard drive to install in there I have always had Seagates and to be honest this is the first that has failed me But it is indeed  years old I installed the new WD in the enclosure in less than  minutes and plugged it in I formatted it for xbox one and installed his games there We played a few games and everything works like a charm With the GB transfer rate I dont think its going to be an issue Granted this is day one I write a ton of reviews so I will be back to let you know if there is any changes in the hard drivePRICE For what I have invested in the hard drive and the fan cooled enclosure it is still cheaper than buying an external hard drive Not by much as they are getting cheaper but someINCLUDED You should know all you are getting is the hard driveThere is nothing else in the box No instructions or cables or plugs or whatever you need to use for your  project This can be installed in a desktop PC that takes a  hard drive or a  hard drive enclosure  If you are unsure on how to install this please google itRemember you live in a video era and you have unlimited knowledge at your fingertipsEASE OF USE Simple PLug and Play You will need to format it for the xbox one Put it in a  USB  enclosure and plug it in Then follow the onscreen prompts Its as easy as clicking a buttonLike I said before I have always been a  Seagate fan because that is the first brand I got  years ago and it lasted this long This is the first WD I have had so I am keeping my fingers crossed on this one I do hope this review helps someone out there If you have any questions please feel free to ask If you found my review helpful let me know Lets keep making better buying decisions together Thank you for reading and as always Be Safe  Happy Shopping",55.5555555555556,"positive"
"this review is for the WD Blue TB SATA  Gbs  RPM MB Cache  Inch Desktop Hard Drive WDEZEX I purchased TWO of these drives delivered together for two custom computer builds I attempted to install Windows  on the first one and upon the first restart the computer went straight to the CHKDSK mode and it indicated bad sectors I restarted again and got a BSODSo OK no problem I installed the other new Hard Drive and the Windows  program loaded and ran just fine but I discovered that the other new Drive is beyond just being noisy on a Cold Start it actually screeches a little but it does quiet down to a more tolerable level in a minute or two when it warms up and so I told my customer about the problem and apologized for the inconvenience when he came to pick up his new computer and told him to bring it back for Hard Drive replacement if it did not quiet down after  some break in time He was not upset but all in all this is a pretty disappointing product experience The Good News is that Amazon makes the return process very easy a new Hard Drive was shipped out and the Bad one was returned in the box it came in with a printed return label from my copy machine Five Stars for Amazon customer service and only Two stars for the Sorry performance of the Hard Drives These drives are the very first drives from Western Digital that I ever had a problem with and unlike previous drives that I purchased from WD I must say that they actually feel very cheap and light My first Red Flag with these two Drives was that neither New Drive needed to be initialized by windows before they could be formatted and that is the first time that has ever happened with a Brand New Hard Drive traditionally brand new hard drives need to be initialized before they can be Formatted and used and that made me suspicious that these May Not in fact be brand new I dont know but maybe something has changed in the Manufacturing process and perhaps all new hard drives come preinitialized now but if thats true that is new information to me I will update this post if there is any problem with the replacement drive that I receive But what I can say with absolute certainty that I will ONLY buy the Higher quality Western Digital RE Enterprise Hard Drives with the Yellow Label from now on they are worth the extra  at current prices just to make sure that I dont have to apologize to another customer for giving him a newly built computer with a subpar Hard drive inside",28.5714285714286,"negative"
"There are more than enough reviews of this disk as an internal drive My interest however was to use it as an external USB drive and that is what this review focuses onThe  WD Blue TB hard disk drive WDC WDEZEXWNA has attractive properties for storage purposes a formatted capacity of  GiB out of its nominal  GiB usually described by manufacturers as  GB a  rpm rotation rate a  MB cache a SATA III interface with a GBs speed and SMART monitoringIt is not the top of the line of Western Digital SATAs at least in terms of the length of their limited warranty  years for the WD Blue versus  years for the Black although there are claims of not too different benchmarks but because of its relatively low price it has a drive value index similar to the top nonSSDs  This makes the WD Blue TB a good choice as an external USB drive for the storage of media or data in particular incremental backups especially when disk writes caching is enabled since top performance values are unrealistic for serving as a guide for external USB devices where performance is primarily dictated by the USB specs and manufacturing complianceThe figure below shows results of a free benchmark app in wide use Crystal DiskMark for the Blue TB used as an external USB storage drive left table and to provide some perspective to these values for an internal SSD with a good performance as a system drive right table  the latter which was partitioned into two logical drives has a capacity of  GB and both devices are quite comparable in the fraction of used capacity ca  which is important since performance declines as a drive gets full  The first line in both tables are the averages of sequential  reads and  writes with multiple queues and threads for a relatively large data block this measures how quickly large files eg backups or multimedia can be read from or written to the drive  The second line are the averages of random  reads and  writes with multiple queues and threads for a small block this measures how quickly many small files eg when copying large app folders or loading programs during operating system startup can be read from or written to the drive  The third and fourth lines mirror the above two but using only a single queue and thread  The lower performance of the Blue TB is only due in part to USB transfer issues published data indicate that if used as an internal drive the values in the left table would have increased by less than two fold  Nevertheless its performance is quite appropriate for external storageI mounted the WD Blue TB vertically in a dualbay USB docking station and it is typically quiet but for some clicks when it starts spinning A negative finding is its temperature after many hours of use compared with a  WD Blue GB disk that warms up to about C F in the second bay of the open docking station the Blue TB gets hotter in the range of C  Temperature is often claimed to affect drive reliability but see Failure Trends in a Large Disk Drive Population by Pinheiro and coworkers  so I put close to the station a small USB fan with an adjustable speed set to a low value to keep it quiet which brings the Blue TB temperature back to the belowC range",66.6666666666667,"positive"
"I have a veritable rainbow of WD drives red green blue between my PC Drobo and newly built NAS and they are all real workhorses  I have yet to have any of them fail or misbehave even after  years  I know certain colors are best suited for certain applications but I find the blue drives to be the best bang for the buck and most versatile  I bought this most recent TB blue to install in an old PC that I turned into a Plex media serverhome made NAS  Ive been wanting to have a dedicated media server for some time and finally had the chance to do it but needed more storage space  The PC I had has a TB hard drive that I wanted to remain dedicated to running software and store all of my movies tv shows documentaries and kiddie crap haha on its own drive  I installed this the other day and loaded all my visual media on it I keep pictures and music on yet another drive and I still have room to spare  I immediately connected the new server to Plex through my Roku  and watched a movie p on the TV while streaming another to my phone and had no trouble whatsoever  I know a lot of the buffering problems stem from inadequate CPU and mine is good but just in case youre wondering these blue drives have no trouble streaming content from when youve got adequate transcoding power in your machine  A lot of people would tell you you need red drives but old blue does just fine in my experience and is so much cheaperFor those of you who are new to installing new hard drives its a piece of cake but just be aware that this drive does not come with any cables or mounting hardware so youll need to be sure you have your own SATA cable and an available power source cable as well as screws or whatever you need to mount it in your case  Also for the newbies you cant just plug and use youll need to go in to your drive manager and nameformat it before you can use it  This is also very very easy to do and only takes a few minutes and then youre ready to goI dont use these WD drives to boot and run software anymore its all about SSDs for that now  buy one it will change your life but I use these drives to hold and back up all of my data for me and I love them  You really cant get more storage and a more reliable drive for a better price than this  And dont be freaked out because the picture shows the inside of the hard disk this is a fully enclosed drive see pics  Hope this helps  Happy computing  I did NOT receive this for free or at a discount",57.1428571428571,"positive"
"It is my professional opinion based on decades of building upgrading and repairing PCs that Western Digital makes the most reliable hard drives in the marketplace I believe this TB hard drive from Western Digital continues their tradition of cool and quiet performance and outstanding reliability and this particular offering is in the sweet spot of cost per unit of storage where you get the most bang for your buckI replaced two TB hard drives with this single TB unit to double my capacity and reduce complexity my two TB drives were configured as a RAID stripe set which increases transfer speed but also doubles the risk of failure The upgrade was easy I was able to quickly move my files to the new drive and it is humming along nicely now at just over  capacityI use this to store all of my files I have an SSD for my mainsystem drive which stores the OS and applications and loads everything lightning fast I was concerned initially about the slower RPM rotation speed of this drive but it has not been a problem at all When I was transferring files to the new drive I was getting between MBsec which is great for a mechanical hard driveThe drive is warm to the touch but not hot I fully expect this drive to perform for years troublefree just like the Western Digital drives it replaced and the Western Digital drives that they replaced before them",50,"netural"
"Working in IT Ive come across many different hard drive vendors and Western Digital by far destroys the competition Ive seen Western Digital hard drives going strong for easily  years with no problems whatsoever These blues are fast quiet and of course economical When one of my clients needs a hard drive upgrade or when theirs goes out I drop in one of these and Im on my wayIf by some strange stroke of bad luck and one of these drives goes bad I simply head over to Western Digital support quickly get an RMA request filed and presto I have a new driveNow brands like SeagateIm lucky to get  years out of them If theres one brand I hate its them if a drive is dead unresponsive has errors makes noises runs hot theres a  chance its a Seagate Id rather use a potato than a Seagate Western Digital hands down",31.5789473684211,"negative"
"On a  Sony Vaio desktop I decided to take advantage of the free Microsoft upgrade to Windows  just to make sure I had another valid Windows  license in the box so to speak Because the Vaio is still in good shape I thought I might as well upgrade its hard drive as the GB exTivo drive I had in there was getting a bit noisy so I ordered this dirt cheap terabyte Western Digital drive Long story short Windows likes large hard disks it makes the operating system run faster due to the virtual memory it likes and at rpm and GBs SATA this is a pretty quick drive The install was painless I cloned the existing drive to the new drive updated Windows which became Windows  Pro and despite the aging Pentium the Vaio has a new lease on life and is impressively peppy The drive isnt just fast it is virtually noiseless and runs cool SMART tells me Back in the box should I need it",63.6363636363636,"positive"
"I never thought Id be leaving a notsogood review for a Western Digital hard drive  Ive favored WD drives for many years  A hard drive has to work reliably or its completely useless  So I dont give super high marks for the device just doing its job  The drive is working  The gripe I have is the drive isnt very well balanced  My computer now makes a droning sound when the new drive spins up and I can feel vibration on the outside of the case  Its yet to be seen if this will impact the drives life span  Ive never had a WD drive soundfeel like this  I hope WD isnt starting to let their quality control slip  Historically Western Digital is one of the safest  most reliable drives to buy  It will be nice when highcapacity solid state is cheap enough that spinning drives are no longer a consideration",60,"positive"
"I bought two of these in April of  They have been running in my desktop since then The one of the two that does get heavier use has just failed It is now getting bad sectors popping up all over the place The other seems like it is doing OK but I will probably replace it as well Three years is a bit on the low side for durability While it certainly outlasted its warranty I would have hoped it would have lasted at least  years With over  years in desktop support I have seen the majority of systems last on the floor with no hardware failures for  years Since it did last more than three years a three star rating seems fair This drive is certainly decent just dont expect it to last especially under moderately heavy use",42.8571428571429,"negative"
"I installed this to replace my failing OEM hard drive  I am an old retired guy with extensive training and experience with electronics but my area of expertise was radio satellite and microwave communications not computers  Installation and cloning the new drive using the WD Acronis software downloaded free from the WD website was easy and straightforward  The only problem I had was of my own making I didnt run Check Disk on my old drive before attempting to clone the new one  My old drive was failing and I knew that from the beginning  I had to stop and go back run Check Disk and let it repair the bad sectors it found  Once I did that the cloning went smoothly and much quicker than I expected  I then removed the old drive and put everything back together  It is working like a new computer now  By the way my system is using Windows  Home Edition",33.3333333333333,"negative"
"I purchased this as a secondary drive for my Windows  Pro machine It does its job of additional storage However prospective buyers should understand the difference between MBR and GPT when configuring this something I did not do MBR Master Boot Record is the older drive standard that most machines have used GPT GUID Partition Table is a newer standard to replace this These are not to  be confused with file formats such as FAT NTFS or ext MBR only supports up to TB disk space for a drive while GPT does not have this limitationI chose MBR when setting up my drive only to find later that Windows was only seeing TB of disk space while GB of space remained unallocated I could not change this in Windows Disk Management There is a way to change this via Windows Command Prompt However users unfamiliar with the Command Prompt should not use this method The safer option is to download a free trial of partition software to rebuild the entire disk as GPT If you do not want to do this you can create an Ubuntu Live CD and run GParted to format the unallocated disk space into an NTFS drive Windows will see this as a separate drive and assign it its own letter this is called a logical partition as both drives reside within one physical disk",75,"positive"

"At home using a robust Internet connection Ive been spoiled to be able to watch streaming videos at times that are convenient for me  During my motorhome travels where reliable highspeed Internet connections are usually NOT available Ive depended upon satellite TV movie channels  Unfortunately the satellite movies have been scheduled at their convenience and not necessarily mine  The solution for me was a Digital Video Recorder DVRI bought this hard drive in combination with a Sabrent USB  SATA Inch Aluminum Hard Drive Enclosure ECGD so I could use it with the DishTV VIPK satellite receiver in my motorhome  The combination of those two items from Amazon  cost between  and  less than similar offerings on DishTVs Website  According to DishTV a TB hard drive will record  hours of video but they dont say if itll record that many hours in HDInstalling this hard drive into the Sabrent enclosure took no more than three minutes which I felt was time wellspent considering what I saved  After I plugged this enclosed hard drive into the satellite receivers USB port turned it on and had DishTV activate the hard drive which costs  it took about five minutes to format  Completing this installation Ive been able to automatically record movies from my satellite receiver and then play them back at a time when it is convenient for me to watchIn this DVR application I could not ask for better performance  I can set up the DVR to record movies automatically and have those movies waiting for me when its convenient for me to view them  The recordings are as clear and sharp as the original programming and play without pauses stuttering or glitches  Compared with buying a hard drive that was already in a housing with a power supply this combination costs less and provides flawless performance",41.6666666666667,"negative"

"Purchased for installation in my fathers primary PC to replace an existing drive that was starting to fail The cloning process went smoothly which allowed us to forego a lengthy reinstall of OS applications and backed up data Unfortunately after  days the machine in which the drive was installed began to exhibit problems rebooting nightly windows popups complaining about being unable to save  write to files Doing a chkdsk x f r and rebooting claimed to correct filesystem problems but running the provided Data LifeGuard software for Windows detected bad sectors that it claimed it was unable to repair It recommended we contact WD support for assistanceI recognize that we happened to get one of the few bad drives in a batch but the warranty  replacement process as described on their site is frustrating Effectively the consumer is left without a functioning computer unless they invest additional money into another drive on which to copy their OS and data while the faulty product is shipped examined and repaired  replaced Given the cost of shipping and the low cost of the smaller drives its probably more cost effective to simply write it off Sadly the consumer is left with a bad taste in their mouths from the experience",41.6666666666667,"negative"

"This is a great basic hard drive Its a terabyte spins at  RPM and has a  Gbps SATA throughput To top it off its a great price per GB  sure there are drives at higher capacities with lower prices per GB but this is the sweetspot A thumb rule I use to calculate that how much does the next lower capacity cost In this case  GB sells at about  Add  and your capacity doubles to this  TB model Thats  increase in capacity for  increase in price Whenever a Hard drive capacity falls in this rule thats what I define as the budget sweetspotComing back to topic at hand The hard drive arrived in basic but very functional packaging with adequate protection And its working perfectly fine so it living proof that its all good in terms of packaging and handling I unpacked it and installed it into my desktop  a process that took about  minutes end to end I booted up the computer and voila the hard disk was seen Windows initialized it and in matter of seconds I was up an running with this shiny new storage bin for all my games movies and musicIve been a WD user for years after switching over from Seagate due to sheer number of RMAs I had to do with Seagate And once again I am super satisfied with this model Go for it its a great budget hard drive with the optimal capacity based on my formula above",76.4705882352941,"positive"

"ITS A GREEN DRIVE NOT BLUEokay the label is blue and it is as advertised but if you bought WD HDDs before you know what that meansHistoryWD made cheap and bad green  drives RPM and in efforts to boost sales they got their label changed to blue and discontinued the use of green labels  marketting SOBsWell anyways kinda expected that for  that I paid This goes into the PS  adapter so not a big deal if it failsBefore the facts there is GOOD NEWS and its listed at the bottom and the drive does work fine right now but  stars because Im worried ok it makes noises probably normal noises and it is really a cheap green drive so that worries me tooThe current factsIt vibrates it makes old and somewhat loud pc like noise head movement when playing games or when not playing games but transferring more than one file at same time downloading  or  games at once If it is doing multi file transfer but one after another instead of all at once then the head doesnt move much so no noise can be heardThe intensity of the noise is no louder than old drives of the s so Im only half worried as this may be the actual design of this driveIt gets warm almost too warm but not toasty granted it could use better ventilation and it is sitting in the adapter thing above a warm psThere was one BIG issue which may have been the ps adapters fault where I lost all data on the rd day It would turn on and spin but ps could not recognize it or be able to initialize it pss version of formattingThe fix was to use pc and rd party freeware to rebuid the MBR Guess something went wrong with ps Afterward once MBR was rebuilt it still only worked after I initialized pss version of formatting the whole drive and started resh again and that was a BIG improvement weeks and  TB later it is doing okI still dont know what went wrong that dayTHE GOOD NEWS  best for last ehNo surface errors found tested this right out the package and after I had ps screw up the hdd MBR assuming it was PS that did it or the adapterGuess ill keep track of it and rereview if i can once it screws up again and Ill do SMART diagnostics to make sure the drive is not at fault",52.3809523809524,"positive"

"All hard drives fail eventually Its not a matter of if but when WD has a great warranty and the process is painless If the drive fails under warranty they will even do an advance replacement If the drive fails out of warranty they will offer a steep discount on a drive the same size or larger You cant go wrong with that I have built a lot of systems and overall the Western Digital drives have worked out better longer than other brands Ive tried I was looking for a  RPM drive because thats the sweet spot with spindle speed  RPM drives are nice but expensive and tend to run very hot  RPM drives are okay for laptops but not what I want in a desktop environment MB of cache also is a plus for me Unit was shipped incredibly fast arrived in perfect condition installed without any issues and represents the best value and performance for the money",61.5384615384615,"positive"

"The price is good for a lot of space on a RPM driveEasy installation involved the usual snapping in a SATA data cable and a SATA power cable then placing the drive in a snapon caddy and sliding it into the drive bay in my PC  Installation took about  mins total  My Windows  PC recognized it immediately  Quick formatted it and ready to goThen cloned the old TB to the new TB drive using USEASE which makes it a rather simple process of cloning drives of different sizes  Removed the TB drive from the PC since I dont need itChanged the Drive letter of the new TB drive control panel  Administrative tasks  Computer management Disk Manager to the correct drive letter because this drive is used mainly as a programs installation drive since the boot drive is a limited space SSD  Tested the drive and loaded up a few programs from it which all worked fineNo problems at all  Happy customer loyal WD drive user  Lets hope WD keeps making class drives",60,"positive"

"If youre looking for a hard drive for your Xbox One this is the one I would recommend through and through  Its surprisingly quiet and outperforms the Western Digital Black series in some areas  In fact I notice everything is faster running and installing to this drive over the stock one  The bang you get for your buck is awesome here folksIf you want more space I say go with the TB but eventually youll be playing musical chairs anyway  Considering you save  off the comparable Black models Blue is an underdog that you GOT to loveAs others have mentioned in their reviews the average read speeds are quite impressive with the TB WD Blue drives  The only thing it seems to struggle with is random access  Thats because they literally spin up after being idle  It sounds like a mini airplane  Actually its very quiet too  But if you listen close enough you might hear it  Not a big deal but fun to think aboutDo not try to fly this hard drive  It is NOT a vehicleXBOX ONE PEEPS  I recommend the Sabrent external hard drive enclosure  Make sure its the one that supports USB and SATA  It has a fan onoff button and you can hotswap hard drives  The latter I would not recommend due to potential data loss but its cool You can flip the lid and put another hard drive in  Really great if your gaming library is massive and you dont want to go through the process of redownloading stuff all over again  Believe me I understand  I have the worst ISP ever and they charge for data usage  The name sounds like Dom Fast Yup wink",66.6666666666667,"positive"

"I was torn between the Blue Red and Blacks Having always unhesitatingly gone for the WD Black this time I already had SSD storage to provide fast immediate storage Did I really need to spend the extra cash on the WD Black line over the Blue I decided to do some researchFirst the RPM speeds Red spin slower somewhere around  while the Blues and Blacks do rpm This makes sense The Reds are meant to go in NAS enclosures which means possibly a few  disks in close proximity The slower speeds generate less heat  which matters more since there are multiple drives and not just a single drive  which helps improve disk conditions and longevity The Blues and Blacks are meant to go in Desktops The Blacks have a  year warranty whereas these Blue only have a  year warranty  year with the Retail kitThe WD Black perform better than the WD Blue line but not by much If you dont already have an SSD and only need one main drive pick a WD Black To be honest the main difference is the warranties previously mentioned The extra cost of the Black ensures you wont have to buy another drive for  extra years Personally I figured I could afford to spend the cost of another WD Blue should it fail after  years so the extra warranty period for the WD Black was not a factor for meThe last thing which helped me pick the Blue line was a Western Digital document which specifically stated that both the Black and Blue drives are fine in Desktop RAID setups  Intel RST LSI HBAs etc  they just arent recommended for NASEnterprise RAID setups I was worried about TLER lack there of and the shorter warranty period but when I realized they could both be put in a RAID setup the difference between these drives became a nonfactorThat said I havent yet turned my drives into a RAID array and am using them in JBOD   Just a Bunch of Disks  mode meaning Im using them much as most people would I can honestly say there isnt a noticeable difference on the user experience side of things on the difference between the WD Black and the WD Blue I highly doubt a user that claims he could blindly tell the difference between the drives",58.3333333333333,"positive"

"I was torn between the Blue Red and Blacks Having always unhesitatingly gone for the WD Black this time I already had SSD storage to provide fast immediate storage Did I really need to spend the extra cash on the WD Black line over the Blue I decided to do some researchFirst the RPM speeds Red spin slower somewhere around  while the Blues and Blacks do rpm This makes sense The Reds are meant to go in NAS enclosures which means possibly a few  disks in close proximity The slower speeds generate less heat  which matters more since there are multiple drives and not just a single drive  which helps improve disk conditions and longevity The Blues and Blacks are meant to go in Desktops The Blacks have a  year warranty whereas these Blue only have a  year warranty  year with the Retail kitThe WD Black perform better than the WD Blue line but not by much If you dont already have an SSD and only need one main drive pick a WD Black To be honest the main difference is the warranties previously mentioned The extra cost of the Black ensures you wont have to buy another drive for  extra years Personally I figured I could afford to spend the cost of another WD Blue should it fail after  years so the extra warranty period for the WD Black was not a factor for meThe last thing which helped me pick the Blue line was a Western Digital document which specifically stated that both the Black and Blue drives are fine in Desktop RAID setups  Intel RST LSI HBAs etc  they just arent recommended for NASEnterprise RAID setups I was worried about TLER lack there of and the shorter warranty period but when I realized they could both be put in a RAID setup the difference between these drives became a nonfactorThat said I havent yet turned my drives into a RAID array and am using them in JBOD   Just a Bunch of Disks  mode meaning Im using them much as most people would I can honestly say there isnt a noticeable difference on the user experience side of things on the difference between the WD Black and the WD Blue I highly doubt a user that claims he could blindly tell the difference between the drives",58.3333333333333,"positive"

"While not a fast as the WD Black drives this drive is quite capable  Having always had good luck with WD drives I insist on their products for mechanical HDDsOne thing that is very important to me is how this unit was packaged and shipped  The bagged drive was firmly suspended by its ends in a sturdy cardboard box  That box was then packed in the shipping box  Contrast this to how some suppliers one that has yellow eggs on its logo for example ship loose drives in a box of peanuts and Amazon is the way to go  at the same or lower price too",66.6666666666667,"positive"

"This drive is not plug and play with my Dell Inspiron  with Windows  Pro Heres how I got the drive to workFirst off the drive comes with no cable or mounting screws  I had to separately purchase a  pin SATA cable compatible with SATA II  Get a cable with a least one of the connectors on it being straight rather than right angle because a right angle might block an adjacent SATA receptacle on the motherboardSecond get some mounting screws I had some laying around so I didnt buy them and thus cannot give you the size or length  Suffice to say they are the same screws that are standard for most tower casesFYI if youve installed IDE drives in the past you may recall having to set jumpers to specify whether the drive is primary or slave No jumpers required with this SATA driveOkay on with the installation  After plugging the drive into the power cable and SATA cable i turned the machine on  After it fully started up and I logged in I waited awhile and finally got a message saying something like new device installedThen I rebooted the computer and during the reboot I hit F so i could access the CMOS Utility screen  One of the options on that screen allowed me to look at the hard disc drives HDD  I did that to confirm that the computer in fact saw a drive was connected  I did not change any settings and simply exited the utility and proceeded to full start up of the pc  This step is probably optional since youll access the drive status in the Disc Management step belowI then opened windows explorer and prayed that the drive appeared  Alas it did not  Thats because the drive still had to be initialized partitioned and formattedTo do those steps access Administrative Tools in Control Panel by going to Start selecting Control Panel and then in the Control Panel windows top right corner type Administrative Tools and hit the search magnifying glass icon  From Administrative Tools go to Computer Management  Storage  Disc Management  Fyi when i clicked Computer Management i had to wait awhile while the computer accessed something called a snapin I also had to wait awhile after clicking Disc Management for the system to find the data it needed regarding the status of the discsIn Disc Management you should see all your hard disk drives listed My preexisting hard disk is listed as Disc   The new disk is listed as Disc   I was automatically prompted to initialize  Disc   After initializing it the disc is listed as having unallocated storageRightclick inside the black strip representing the unallocated storage space and select New Simple Volume  A wizard will then walk you through formatting and partitioning the disc and assigning it a drive letter and assigning the drive a name of your choosing  I chose to use NTFS as the formatting system and not to partition it into multiple partitionsIm not anywhere close to a computer expert so I dont know if this was the best way to get the job done but it seems to be working out fine for me  Hope this helps you all",54.5454545454545,"positive"

"I bought two of these drives  I purchased the first drive in September to replace a Seagate drive which had begun to fail after six years  This Western Digital failed after only three and a half months  The drive would boot but it developed numerous bad sectors which among other things prevented Windows from installing any system updates I replaced it with a second one in February  That drive set a record for the fastest drive failure I have ever seen since I built my first computer back in  no such thing as hard drives back then it died in only two weeks This was a more serious failure After only two weeks it would not recognize any files would not allow reformatting and Windows said it cold not write to the drive to repair or reinstall Windows These were my first and last Western Digital drives  I always avoided them in the past as WD has always had a reputation of being the blue light special of hard drives  I should have listened to myself  I got smart and bought another Seagate and expect to spend many happy years with it  The Seagate performs beautifully file transfers are faster as are readwrite times  I plan to add a second Seagate drive this month and will never waste another dime on Western Digital garbage",25,"negative"

"When I opened the drive I was immediately struck at the light weight of this drive It has to weigh less than half of any other drive I own and I have many HDs It almost felt as though they had sent the shell with out the gutsThe drive was DOA Would not initialize would not format It would however lock my system up tight Had to do a hard shutdown as ctrlaltdel wouldnt work nor would the reset button My only recourse was to hold down the power button for the  second shutdownThe drive arrived in a box within a box with a gap on the side and top with no padding so poor packaging likely contributed to its demise but Im very disappointed in the build quality of this drive Ive ordered a Caviar Black to replace it I hope it isnt also suffering the build quality issues or Ill have to shop a new HD manufacturer",25,"negative"
