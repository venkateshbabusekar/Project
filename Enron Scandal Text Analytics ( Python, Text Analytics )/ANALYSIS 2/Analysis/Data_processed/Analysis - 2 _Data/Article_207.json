{"headline": {"main": "CBS News Asks '60 Minutes' To Cut Back On Producers"}, "lead_paragraph": "In what many CBS News staff members described as the first time in memory that television's pre-eminent newsmagazine has been asked to reduce its production staff, ''60 Minutes'' is cutting back its corps of producers as part of a plan by CBS News to pare its budget in reaction to the rising costs of covering the war in Afghanistan. The cuts are not being called layoffs because some, or perhaps all, of those dropped from ''60 Minutes'' may be reassigned to other CBS News programs, such as another network newsmagazine show, ''48 Hours.'' CBS executives described the move as minor and said that as few as five or six producers or associate producers may be cut from a staff of 100, a modest number, especially in comparison to the sweeping staff reductions in recent months at other media companies.", "news_desk": "Business/Financial Desk", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "abstract": "Television news program 60 Minutes is reducing its production staff as part of plan by CBS News to pare its budget in reaction to rising costs of covering war in Afghanistan; cuts are not being called layoffs because some, or perhaps all, of those dropped from 60 Minutes may be reassigned to other news programs; although executives describe move as only affecting handful of staff members, move is seen as significant reflection of economic strains of war coverage and possible decline of program's status; photo (M)", "print_page": "1", "type_of_material": "News", "source": "The New York Times", "_id": "4fd229968eb7c8105d7b3cf2", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "SIXTY MINUTES (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "AFGHANISTAN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "CBS CORP"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LABOR"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FINANCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "LAYOFFS AND JOB REDUCTIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "NEWS AND NEWS MEDIA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}], "pub_date": "2001-11-12T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": [], "snippet": "In what many CBS News staff members described as the first time in memory that television's pre-eminent newsmagazine  has been asked to reduce its production staff, ''60 Minutes'' is cutting back its corps of producers as part of a plan by CBS New...", "slideshow_credits": null, "word_count": 1103, "byline": {"person": [{"lastname": "CARTER", "role": "reported", "rank": 1, "organization": "", "firstname": "Bill"}, {"lastname": "RUTENBERG", "role": "reported", "rank": 2, "organization": "", "firstname": "Jim"}], "original": "By BILL CARTER and JIM RUTENBERG"}, "web_url": "http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/12/business/cbs-news-asks-60-minutes-to-cut-back-on-producers.html", "section_name": "Business; Washington"}
