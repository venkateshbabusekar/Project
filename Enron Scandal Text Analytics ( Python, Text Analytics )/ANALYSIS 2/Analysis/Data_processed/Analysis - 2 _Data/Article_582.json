This was, as the military historian and classicist Victor Davis Hanson writes in this provocative book, ''one of the most deadly battles in the entire history of naval warfare.'' Lured by a brilliant Greek strategy through the narrow straits, and rammed by Greek ships, hundreds of Persian vessels were sunk; more than 40,000 Persian soldiers were drowned or killed. But Mr. Hanson, who teaches at California State University in Fresno, says this battle is more than just a textbook example of warfare. Herodotus pointed out that many of the Persian fighters were mercenaries or slaves; any soldierly hesitation was typically punished by beheading. Free citizens, Herodotus argued, made better warriors -- more motivated and more flexible. The Greeks were fighting, as Aeschylus pointed out, for their freedom; the Persians, out of fear or greed.", "news_desk": "Arts & Ideas/Cultural Desk", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "abstract": "Edward Rothstein reviews Carnage and Culture: Landmark Battles in the Rise of Western Power by Victor Davis Hanson (M)", "print_page": "17", "type_of_material": "News", "source": "The New York Times", "_id": "4fd267668eb7c8105d81ccb0", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "CARNAGE AND CULTURE (BOOK)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "HANSON, VICTOR DAVIS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "ARMAMENT, DEFENSE AND MILITARY FORCES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "BOOKS AND LITERATURE"}], "pub_date": "2001-12-01T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": [], "snippet": "In 480 B.C., near Salamis off the coast of Greece, an armada of perhaps a thousand Persian ships attacked some 300 Greek vessels.
