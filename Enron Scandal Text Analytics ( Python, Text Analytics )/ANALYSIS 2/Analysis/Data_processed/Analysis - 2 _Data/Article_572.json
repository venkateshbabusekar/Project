{"headline": {"main": "Making Message Movies With Plenty of Cleavage", "kicker": "FILM REVIEW"}, "lead_paragraph": "If you've been longing to see the semilegendary Vietnam War film ''Brothers Divided,'' ''The Independent,'' a documentary portrait of the director Morty Fineman, offers a searing glimpse. His ''Brothers Divided'' follows Siamese twins, one of whom is an ardent hippie dove and the other a saber-rattling hawk, into Southeast Asia, where one is killed and the other survives. Later, back in Washington, the surviving twin, cradling his dead brother's head, delivers a fiery antiwar speech. ''Brothers Divided'' was one of seven (count 'em, seven!) movies that its prolific producer and director made in 1969. Other Fineman films that year included ''Groovy Hippie Slumber Party,'' ''Mondo World'' and ''The Mod, Mod Miniskirt.'' Since his 1964 directorial debut, ''The Simplex Complex,'' an Army training film about herpes, Mr. Fineman has turned out an unbelievable 427 films. He also takes credit for having introduced Roman numerals at the end of movie titles, as in his late-70's epic ''World War III II.''", "news_desk": "Movies, Performing Arts/Weekend Desk", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "abstract": "making messa", "print_page": "23", "type_of_material": "Review", "source": "The New York Times", "_id": "4fd2676d8eb7c8105d81d222", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "INDEPENDENT, THE (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "KESSLER, STEPHEN D"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "pub_date": "2001-11-30T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": [], "snippet": "If you've been longing to see the semilegendary Vietnam War film ''Brothers Divided,'' ''The Independent,'' a documentary portrait of the director Morty Fineman, offers a searing glimpse.
