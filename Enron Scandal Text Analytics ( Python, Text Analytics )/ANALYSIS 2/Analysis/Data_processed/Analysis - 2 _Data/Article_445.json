{"headline": {"main": "World Briefing | Europe: Russia: Agreement On Moldova Rebels"}, "lead_paragraph": "President Vladimir V. Putin and his Moldovan counterpart, Vladimir Voronin, pledged to cooperate on reining in Transnistria, a separatist region of the impoverished former Soviet republic of Moldova. Transnistria, which borders Ukraine and is primarily Russian speaking, declared independence from Moldova in 1992, spurring a short, brutal war. Moldova borders Romania and Ukraine and is populated mostly by ethnic Romanians but depends completely on Russia for its energy supply. Russian forces are still based in Trans-Dniester but Russian officials say they have withdrawn all military hardware and will soon cut the force to 1,500 troops.
