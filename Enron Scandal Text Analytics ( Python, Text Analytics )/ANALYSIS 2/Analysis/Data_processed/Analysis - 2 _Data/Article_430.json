{"headline": {"main": "Metro Briefing | New York: Manhattan: A Fire Truck For New York"}, "lead_paragraph": "Four South Carolina middle school students completed their state's 134-year-old promise to buy New York a fire truck yesterday, handing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani a $354,000 check. ''The firemen were so proud of us and they were happy,'' said Staci Smith, a student from White Knoll Middle School in Lexington County. ''When we presented the check to Mayor Giuliani, he just had the biggest smile on his face.'' It took the students and the community 56 days to raise more than a half-million dollars, surpassing their fund-raising goal to replace one of the dozens of rescue vehicles lost in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The students led the drive to return a favor New York City firefighters paid in 1867 when they gave equipment to Columbia, S.C., which was reduced to using bucket brigades to put out fires after the Civil War. The South Carolina Remembers fund collected $510,000. The fire truck will cost $354,000, and extra money will be used to upgrade the type of truck or to buy other firefighting equipment.", "news_desk": "Metropolitan Desk", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "abstract": "Students from four South Carolina middle schools present New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani with check for $354,000 to buy fire truck to replace vehicle lost in Sept 11 attack (M)", "print_page": "5", "type_of_material": "News", "source": "AP", "_id": "4fd267698eb7c8105d81cf65", "keywords": [{"name": "persons", "value": "GIULIANI, RUDOLPH W"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "SOUTH CAROLINA"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WORLD TRADE CENTER (NYC)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "FIRES AND FIREMEN"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "CHILDREN AND YOUTH"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HIJACKING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}], "pub_date": "2001-11-23T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": [], "snippet": "Four South Carolina middle school students completed their state's 134-year-old promise to buy New York a fire truck yesterday, handing Mayor Rudolph W.
