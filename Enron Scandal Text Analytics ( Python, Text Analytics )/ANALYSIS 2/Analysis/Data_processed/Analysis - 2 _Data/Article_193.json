Said does not need me to step to his defense in response to Judith Shulevitz's attempt to define the proper role for the intellectual in society, but surely we all have to believe that thinking clearly is the first obligation for any intellectual. Shulevitz falls far short in her claim that Said's injunction to support the weak would have led an intellectual to support the Confederacy. Said's dictum would obviously have called on intellectuals during the Civil War to side with the enslaved. Shulevitz's implausible reading prevents her from asking the crucial question that a commitment to the weak requires: who is weak, and why? A serious commitment to answering that question almost never produces a simple morality play.
