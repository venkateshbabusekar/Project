Giles seems to think that we Americans are missing out on some important news by not seeing Osama bin Laden's videotapes on national television; that Al Jazeera is a model news organization and that Osama bin Laden has some serious political messages we should be hearing. I wonder if Mr. Giles isn't missing something. Is it possible that Al Jazeera is allowing itself to be used by Al Qaeda?
