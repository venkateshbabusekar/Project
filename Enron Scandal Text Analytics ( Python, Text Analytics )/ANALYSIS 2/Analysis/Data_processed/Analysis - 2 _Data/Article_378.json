''Spy Game'' is seamlessly and crisply edited, a fast-moving collage of global architecture, top-secret documents and murky skulduggery with an accompanying soundtrack of world music and classic rock. Like a hot game of paint ball or a midsize sedan with sporty trim and a spoiler on the back, the movie provides a vehicle for macho romanticism, a fantasy of danger and derring-do for the deskbound.", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "abstract": "A O Scott reviews movie Spy Game, directed by Tony Scott; Robert Redford plays CIA veteran, Brad Pitt his protege; photo (M)", "print_page": "1", "type_of_material": "Review", "source": "The New York Times", "_id": "4fd2676f8eb7c8105d81d32e", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "SPY GAME (MOVIE)"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "REDFORD, ROBERT"}, {"name": "persons", "value": "PITT, BRAD"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MOTION PICTURES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}], "pub_date": "2001-11-21T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": [], "snippet": "Many of Tony Scott's movies -- ''Top Gun,'' ''Crimson Tide,'' ''Enemy of the State,'' and now ''Spy Game'' -- are like gadgets in the Sharper Image catalog: sleek, expensive handsome gizmos of doubtful utility.
