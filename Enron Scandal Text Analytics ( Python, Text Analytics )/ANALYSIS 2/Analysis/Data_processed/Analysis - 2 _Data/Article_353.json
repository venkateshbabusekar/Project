At this point even the experts are unable to guess which forces will do what in the power centers the Taliban abandoned or in the enclaves where they are holding on. Top American officials admit that before Sept. 11 they had no clear idea of what the Taliban's power structure was, or how many supporters it had. Even now, they know little or nothing about the identities of the Taliban loyalists, defectors and opponents spread throughout Pashtun-speaking southern Afghanistan. ''We do not have a profound understanding of the Afghans,'' admitted an American diplomat who has traveled extensively in the country. ''We haven't been inside the country for 10 years, so we have to rely on the Afghans who come to the West. We don't know the tribes right now. We don't know the tribal leadership. We don't know beans.''", "news_desk": "Editorial Desk", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "abstract": "Steven R Weisman's Editorial Observer column examines difficulty of determining who political players are in Afghanistan and predicting their future behavior; says ethnic, tribal, linguistic and sectarian loyalty is central order of things in society that remains rural and feudal in nature (M)", "print_page": "18", "type_of_material": "Editorial", "source": "The New York Times", "_id": "4fd2298a8eb7c8105d7b32f3", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "EDITORIAL OBSERVER (TIMES COLUMN)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "NEW YORK CITY"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "WASHINGTON (DC)"}, {"name": "glocations", "value": "AFGHANISTAN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "TALIBAN"}, {"name": "organizations", "value": "NORTHERN ALLIANCE"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "WORLD TRADE CENTER (NYC)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "AIRLINES AND AIRPLANES"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "PENTAGON BUILDING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "MISSING PERSONS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "POLITICS AND GOVERNMENT"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "HIJACKING"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TERRORISM"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "UNITED STATES ARMAMENT AND DEFENSE"}], "pub_date": "2001-11-19T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": [], "snippet": "Americans shocked by the rapid collapse of the Taliban in Afghanistan probably have a lot more surprises in store.
