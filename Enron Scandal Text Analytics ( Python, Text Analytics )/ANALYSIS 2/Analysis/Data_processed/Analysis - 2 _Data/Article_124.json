{"headline": {"main": "World Briefing | Middle East: Israel: Arab Lawmaker Faces Charges"}, "lead_paragraph": "Israeli lawmakers voted to lift the parliamentary immunity of Azmi Bishara, an Israeli Arab legislator, so he can be prosecuted for remarks urging resistance to Israel and for arranging visits by Israeli Arabs to Syria, with which Israel is technically at war. It was the first time a lawmaker had been stripped of his immunity for political statements. At a memorial gathering in Damascus last June after the death of President Hafez al-Assad, Mr. Bishara called for broadening ''the path of resistance'' to Israel. He denies that he incited violence and says he supports the right of Palestinians to struggle against Israeli occupation.
