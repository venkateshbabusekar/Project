I don't recall seeing one (and I am sure I would have remembered it). This is to be expected, you may say, and thank heavens for it. But wait. People in the entire world see buildings burning and falling down -- buildings that symbolize American economic and military power. This is entirely too abstract when close-up images of destroyed individual people in Afghanistan are distributed. As a result, the image war is spun in our opposition's behalf, for they do not have the hesitancy of good taste and decorum and respect for the families of the victims that we do. In this sense, television is failing us.
