From a viewer's perspective, though, this face-off is more like a battle between two aging, lumbering elephants. The sturdy ''Big Apple'' is so unsurprising it might as well have been around for years. The co-creator of the series, David Milch, did as much as anyone to shape the tough-talking, down-to-earth brashness of ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' but here he may be a victim of his own groundbreaking past. That wouldn't be a first. After ''N.Y.P.D. Blue,'' Steven Bochco and Mr. Milch ran out of energy with the failed police drama ''Brooklyn South,'' and every new Ken Burns documentary lives with the echo of his ''Civil War.'' It's hard to enliven a concept that was fresh a decade ago.", "news_desk": "The Arts/Cultural Desk", "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "abstract": "Caryn James reviews new CBS drama series Big Apple; photo (M)", "print_page": "5", "type_of_material": "Review", "source": "The New York Times", "_id": "4fd211cf8eb7c8105d78785d", "keywords": [{"name": "creative_works", "value": "BIG APPLE (TV PROGRAM)"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "REVIEWS"}, {"name": "subject", "value": "TELEVISION"}], "pub_date": "2001-03-01T00:00:00Z", "subsection_name": null, "multimedia": [], "snippet": "In the television industry the new detective drama ''Big Apple'' is billed as a potent challenger to the weakening but still popular ''E.R.''
