{"headline": {"main": "NEWS SUMMARY"}, "lead_paragraph": "INTERNATIONAL A2-6 U.S. Signs Treaty Creating World Court for Atrocities The United States signed a treaty establishing a permanent international criminal tribunal, after President Clinton overrode objections from the Pentagon and defied Republicans in the Senate. Mr. Clinton's decision is not binding without Senate approval, but it is an endorsement of the treaty's goals. A1 Kahane's Son Killed in Ambush Binyamin Kahane, left, a radical right-wing settler and son of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, was killed along with his wife in an ambush in the West Bank. Soft-spoken and introverted, Binyamin Kahane seemed an unlikely heir to the virulently anti-Arab legacy of his fiercely outspoken father. Hours after the attack Israeli soldiers killed a senior Palestinian health official, Dr. Thabet Thabet.
