'5555991584,5,The anthemic title track begins &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; her fourth CD release.  Wordless vocalizations and forceful percussion propel this song into the stratosphere.  &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; the lead single from this CD is typical of her earlier fare like &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; but contains a magic all its own.  The most endearing aspect of this song is its lyrics.  Roma Ryan Enya's long time lyricist deserves much credit for her amazing lyrics on this song.  Relax and fall into the images the music and the words make together.  &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is like a hurricane to me.  It begins ominously like the calm before the storm.  It builds into a frighteningly wicked storm of immense proportions with strings and drums and vocals everywhere. Then in the middle it stops and small lull transpires while angels come down and sing to us.  Then just as suddenly the wind comes up again and we are back into the thick of things.  And then the end comes as suddenly as the beginning.  &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a beautiful ballad which is more lyrical than any other ballad Enya has produced thus far.  In this song Enya sounds very similar to her sister Maire Brennan lead singer of the group Clannad.  &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is another solo piano piece which embodies the title perfectly.  I can picture myself staring at the wide expanse of the ocean or the land from a high cliff.  &quot;China Roses&quot; is a song of love and a song of the past.  You can feel the slow moving but intensely powerful energy in the undercurrent of this song.  Beautiful synthesized sounds add to the atmosphere here.  &quot;Hope Is A Place&quot; sounds melancholy like someone has given up hope and Enya is trying to tell them that it's not too late it's never too late.  For all in love hope has a place in YOUR soul.  This is such a sweet ballad with a simplistic arrangement.  &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot; is another instrumental track which embodies its title perfectly.  The sparkling synthesizers and melodies bring to mind a late evening tea ceremony underneath a bright full moon on a late summer's eve.  &quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a soft waltz a lament if you will of something had and lost here and gone.  &quot;La Sonadora&quot; is the only Enya song to be written in Spanish and includes some unusual but effective chord changes.  A song to relax by.  &quot;On My Way Home&quot; starts off with a slow organ introduction and moves into a complex bassline as Enya travels on her journey home.  It seems as if your mind walks while listening to this song with a stop in the bridge as sweet flutes massage your tired mind.  A fabulous way to end a fabulous CD.,01 3 2001,A2EFCYXHNK06IS,"Abigail Perkins ""Abby &#34;Reads Too Much&#34...",'Enya Experiments And Succeeds,'978480000,4 \  5

'5555991584,5,Enya's richly chorded style has smitten me once again.  A little bit Gregorian a lot Celtic combined with a soft well crafted execution gives us a CD anyone can enjoy and relax with.  Enya performs all the instruments and vocals on the album.  Her vocal style is willowy and sweet which blends with the synthesizer and piano accompaniment perfectly.This is great &quot;Hot Tub&quot; or massage music.  If you're not so lucky as to have both a tub and a masseuse available just try a recliner with a glass of wine.  Enya has given us more great music still with her unique perspective of flow and rhythm.

It is pleasent and uplifting.  It makes me smile and want to twirl in circles.  Maybe this doesn't help anyone else want to buy the CD but if you need some incentive: the CD is soothing and light to listen to.

'5555991584,5,This is my very favorite Enya album to date. Even writing a review of it will not come close to my inner feelings about its music. The first song the title track &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; is the most beautiful song I've ever heard. From quiet strings to layered voices and shy piano to an orchestral-sounding climax with percussion and complex vocal parts this song is gorgeously triumphant. &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; is a catchy but beautiful song that brings to mind wandering through a maze. Another highlight of the album is &quot;Pax Deorum&quot;. The first time I heard it I thought of a group of hooded figures in a dimly-lit temple performing a ceremony. Enya shows off her low range with this piece. It is also interesting that she combines two different languages with two different religious ideas: the polytheism of the Romans (the Latin part) and the monotheism of the Christians (the Irish Gaelic part). Another tidbit: The Irish Gaelic part in &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; uses the same melody and text as the following breathtaking piece &quot;Athair ar Neamh&quot;. Being Catholic (a Christian denomination) I am sure that this song (whose title translates into &quot;Heavenly Father&quot;) has a personal meaning for Enya. &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is also another beautiful but quiet song an emotion-packed instrumental. Enya certainly proves that you can be very quiet but still display strong feelings. From the joy of &quot;China Roses&quot; to the tranquility of &quot;Tea-house Moon&quot; and the expectantcy of &quot;On My Way Home&quot; _The Memory of Trees_ is one of Enya's most wonderful works. I strongly recommend (and LOVE) this album. Brilliant!,06 25 2001,A1REP2FMPOXV4A,Andrew G.,'In a word perfection,'993427200,6 \  8

'5555991584,4,"I only recently discovered this album by Enya as for years I only knew it through her ""Paint the Sky with Stars"" CD. It is a nice CD and it shows Enya experimenting more with synthetic orchestral sounds like ""Anywhere Is"" and with a more pop atmosphere on songs like ""On My Way Home"" though not as overdone like she did on her recent ""Amarantine"".The low points are ""From Where I Am"" which sounds like a new version of ""No Holly for Miss Quinn"" and ""Tea House Moon"" which sounds like something off of a quirky sci-fi soundtrack and not like the peace and beauty it was supposed to represent. Otherwise the album is nice and has a good variety ranging from the hushed ""Athair Ar Neamh"" to the lively ""On My Way Home"". I do have to agree though with other reviews that some of these pieces are not exactly unique. I believe it was with this album that Enya began to be caught in the web of sameness and sadly has not gotten out yet.",05 20 2010,A4BHT5EUI0ZJF,Ashley Cunningham,'Enjoyable,'1274313600,1 \  1
'5555991584,4,Ok first off Enya rocks.  If you don't know that already go buy her compilation album Paint the Sky with Stars.  It will enlighten you.  If you already know how good she is and you aren't desperate to buy everything she's ever done there is something wrong with you.All right so maybe Enya isn't for everyone.  But you will likely appreciate her if you have ever been truly moved by a dreamy piece of music.  She is soft soulfull and dynamic.  And yeah so her music all sounds the same but when it's so good how can you complain?Highlights from The Memory of Trees include &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; and &quot;On My Way Home&quot;.,09 25 2001,A23MKKC68TTTF6,"Bethany R.

'5555991584,5,A clasically-styled and introverted album Memory of Trees is a masterpiece of subtlety.  Many of the songs have an endearing shyness to them - soft piano and a lovely quiet voice.  But within every introvert is an inferno and Enya lets that fire explode on a couple of songs that absolutely burst with an expected raw power.If you've never heard Enya before you might want to start with one of her more popularized works like Watermark just to play it safe.

'5555991584,5,Okay so I'm spreading my #1 rating around.  &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; for this Angel Man is my favorite of Enya's.  When it comes to her music however it is very difficult sometimes to pick #1.  &quot;The Celts&quot; if I absolutely had to narrow my choices down would be second only to this album.  The title track like many of Enya's beautiful lyrics simply melts the world's hatred off my soul in a mere ninety seconds.  I am in disbelief that anyone could not fully appreciate Enya's best work often imitated but never truly equalled.Track six my all time favorite single is a case in point: &quot;I know that if I have heaven there is nothing to desire...&quot;  Who else has even dreamed of such perfect prose?  There is not a single track on &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; that doesn't have something unique and whoever could possibly call that &quot;depressing&quot; must be truly depressed.  This album is only one of the three possessions I would take with me if I suddenly had fifteen seconds to escape an approching disaster.I cannot say enough good things about this album except buy it buy it buy it!  I am having a difficult time as it is restricting the length of my commentary except that this album is the closest thing to my home (...&quot;angel&quot;... remember) that I have heard to date.  If the album is disagreeable at first or sounds monotonous don't worry.  That's just Enya's way of knocking off the hard shell that has encased your soul.  Listen to this album with REPEAT ON for three months and you should be a new person as a result.  I am.  Because of this single music work without equal I have changed only for the better.  It may sound like corny philosophical meanderings but it's a fact.Everything that I have to say about Enya whom I am very glad to call a beloved relative will be nothing short of a love letter.

'5555991584,5,I never thought Enya would reach the sublime heights of Evacuee or Marble Halls from 'Shepherd Moons.' 'The Celts Watermark and Day...' were all pleasant and admirable throughout but are less ambitious both lyrically and musically. But Hope Has a Place from 'Memory...' reaches those heights and beyond. It is Enya at her most inspirational and comforting. I'm actually glad that this song didn't get overexposed the way Only Time did.

'5555991584,5,"THE MEMORY OF TREES combines esoteric grandeur various historical Gaelic elements enigmatic phrases with lyrics that brace the line between comprehension and obscurity in a most effective way.  This was my first Enya album ever and I'm really glad I started my collection with it.  Out of all of Enya's many albums it sets a mood the best.  Starting with the breathtaking 4:19 title track instrumental Enya begins to create a mood of happiness tempered by reflection so effectively with vocals that are both haunting and joyous along with magnificent instrumentation.  This song then moves to the fast-paced ""Anywhere Is"" (one of two singles off the cd).  ""Anywhere Is"" may be the most heavily lyrical based Enya single but she quickly goes through them all painting a feeling of a journey of choices made following a course and misdirection.  Part of what makes this song so successful is the abundant rhyming; Enya's lively vital voice; and its rhythm.  ""Pax Deorum"" five minutes of amazing Latin certainly sets a mood with a darker tone.  It's a powerful song with apparent voice layering amazing instrumentation and a very good beat.  The passion of ""Pax Deorum"" segues into the elegance and beauty of the Gaelic ""Athair ar Neamh"" (meaning ""Father in Heaven"").  This song is truly beautiful with Enya lightly moving through the gorgeous Gaelic stanzas.  ""China Roses"" which clocks in at 4:47 is a majestic masterpiece painting a scene with ethereal elements and has a Utopian feeling about it.  The synthesizer on this piece is quite remarkable fitting the tone of ""China Roses"" perfectly.  ""Hope Has a Place"" is romantic true to life and judging from the way Enya sings it very introspective.  It features some of the grander elements of songs like ""Angeles"" and ""Caribbean Blue"" from Shepherd Moons incorporating sweeping drawn out stanzas and peaceful heartfelt lyrics.  ""Tea-House Moon"" is playful with an almost circus like feeling.  ""Once You Had Gold"" is a serene elegant and genteel.  Many sections of the song are done in the way you'd expect a lullaby to be done; yet it has more practical application than a lullaby with very truthful lyrics that touch the soul.  ""La So&ntilde;adora"" is as majestic as it is an auditory delight especially with the edition of the Spanish lyrics.  The darker feeling in the beginning segues brilliantly into the chorus of voices in the middle section of the song and then concludes with the same feeling of the beginning.  ""On My Way Home"" (the second single off THE MEMORY OF TREES) is an upbeat happy and retrospective song that signals the end of the remarkable journey that is THE MEMORY OF TREES.  It's a fitting conclusion to ""Anywhere Is"" and the entire cd.THE MEMORY OF TREES encompasses various themes various languages and incorporates stunning instrumentals throughout.  Enya has frequently said she tells a lot about herself through her music and I think that's particularly apparent in THE MEMORY OF TREES which by the end of its 44 minutes truly moves you.  If it's the first piece in your Enya collection or last it certainly does not disappoint.",12 9 2001,A376LDXJFOVU6W,Bryan Bradford,'Enya at her esoteric best!,'1007856000,6 \  7

'5555991584,5,This is my favorite Enya album having to do more with a part it played in my life than just its stunning contents.  I listened to The Memory of Trees constantly during a very blue period of my life when I got my heart broken for the first time.  All of the myriad emotions running through me found a voice in songs like Hope Has a Place and Once You Had Gold.  Even On My Way Home tugged at my heart; it conjured up hope in the wake of a bittersweet seperation.  And if that were not enough I felt the reverberation of Tea-House Moon and the title track in the core of my being.  Through it all there was Enya an artist without parallel.  Her grace serenity and raw emotion washed over me healing my bruised and fragile heart.Sorry for the soppy sentimental words but this is the God-honest truth.  I like each and every one of Enya's albums some more than others but The Memory of Trees will always stand apart from the rest for me personally.

'5555991584,4,"Enya despite being a successful recording artist doesn't have the broad appeal as other artists; one reason might be that her kind of music is not very pop station friendly while another reason could be people think they're too ""macho"" for music that she makes. But people with open minds could find there's some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine) the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album's title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10Anywhere Is: The lively single; it's actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It's also a perfect length since it's under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile this one hooks you in then lets you go leaving you wanting more. 9/10Pax Deorum: Another album another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you'd hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh: There's some songs she does where it's more about the song itself rather than a poppy catchy quality a la Only Time and this song's similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing it's a more low-key track but it's also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one's a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it's not technically complex or fast but it's pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10China Roses: There's only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I've ever heard this is definately my favorite song on here plus her whole career even. 15/10Hope Has a Place: For me any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn't do much for me. Granted her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it's just not as memorable. 7/10Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments it's another wordless song although it's more enjoyable than From Where I Am is mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it's a bit more song-oriented. It's different but strangely likable. 8/10Once You Had Gold: We're getting into the album's final stretch and the problem is that with this one it's a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya's more higher vocals (for some reason reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition) it's another beautiful track but it's also a bit...same-y? 8/10La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once it's another slower paced track complete with ""aahs"" for background vocals and synths but again the album could've benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth you'd think it was a bit more upbeat. While it's not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is it does give the album a bit more memorable closer especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them) I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks it's still one of her finest outings.",01 17 2008,A1AISPOIIHTHXX,"Cloud ""...""",'4.5; music to dream to,'1200528000,1 \  1

'5555991584,5,Who knows why I initially considered this to be a duff album by the woman with the most beautiful voice in the world.  Maybe I was expecting Shepherd's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd's Eclipse.  The songs didn't leap out to me?  Well listening to it for this review it finally did and I've embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent sporting the usual instrumentals pianos haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life isn't it?&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it's an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh how I love this woman!OK all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how's this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home and the heart is free.&quot;  I can't decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;The third instrumental &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot; has some Oriental strains with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come seasons go type and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it's more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song's midsection.A reminiscing night traveller's thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot; where &quot;I remember all the best days/I'm on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums Enya's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I've ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here as it's &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.  There's more a wall of dreamy sound here--check out how many times I've mentioned this.  Repeated listenings will tell whether it'll dislodge Shepherd's Moon as my favourite Enya album.,07 30 2003,A2P49WD75WHAG5,Daniel J.

'B00LPXAGV4,5,Finally one of my favorite Electronic Pop albums is available! SSQ was a very influential Techno band from SoCal at the time of Missing Persons and Berlin. The Canadian born band leader and producer  Jon St. James helped shape Berlin's techno pop sound in his studio Casbah. Playback was originally on Enigma Records and then picked up by EMI America just before the label folded. SSQ was left out in the cold and the album which is amazing got little to no promotion. Transatlantic the solo album by St. James was released just after SSQ and suffered the same fate. &#34;The Girl Who Seduced the World&#34; which was on the Transatlantic album is included on this version of Playback which makes me think it was originally an SSQ song. The only previous release of Playback was vinyl and had only 8 songs. This re-mastered version has 14 songs including two versions of Tonight (we'll make love until we die) from the cult horror movie Return of the Living Dead. SSQ's sound is Electronic pop with a Euro twist and undercurrent of American rock and topping it off the sultry sexy voice of beautiful ingenue Stacey Swain later known as Stacey Q (Two of Hearts). SSQ's influence on the Electronic Techno Pop genre can not be understated. This release is a treasure. Re-mastering is quite good: Highly recommended.,07 15 2014,AVITQOKP6DYKX,Upgrade,'Finally one of my favorite Electronic Pop albums is available,'1405382400,0 \  0
'B00LQ8DG24,5,I read about Lena Fayre in a Rolling Stone article that billed her as an artist you need to know and I really liked the songs from her self-titled EP. I signed up for her newsletters and got one earlier today that said that she has a new single out so I listened to the preview and decided to buy it. I Am Not A Man is a wonderful song performed beautifully by a 17-year singer with a distinctive voice that draws you into the music in a memorizing way. I am glad that I found her.

'B00LQ92TE4,5,While exactly one-minute shorter than the primary Womack version and missing the incredible cello as well as back-up singers I was surprised that a cover could be better than the original!  I still love both versions (I could have written this song before and following my 13-year Life Crash of self-hatred a six-month Life Crash of being risk averse and a two-year Murphy type Life Crash) but I'm glad that Mark D. Sanders and Tia Sillers Purcell did write it.  It is always an exciting pleasure to teach the 12-week workshop that this song Inspired.  I've got a feeling that no matter what happened the world (at least Nashville) has just begun to hear from Sarah Darling.  &#34;Winning&#34; doesn't always matter.
