This has been one of my favorite CDs for years
I agree there really isn't much of a difference between Meteora and Hybrid Theory but if you liked the first than you'll like this one.  My only gripe is that the album is SO SHORT.  The best songs are Faint From The Inside and Numb.
MAN. this cd is.....great. i have hybrid theory and that's been one of my faves for a long time. LP stretches their boundaries in Meteora. They explore more music styles without losing their trademark sound. one can tell they put in tons of work into this album and it is well worth it! the cd comes with a thick (40-pg. as advertised) booklet with notes from the band (a plus). that booklet and the DVD gives you a little window into their world of music it also enforces the amount of work they put into this album. the only bad thing about Meteora is that it's kinda short 36 minutes long. though the quantity is small the QUALITY is high. my faves on the album so far are:Lying From You: awesome rock-rap fusion as usual. i don't like  rap but Mike is awesome. this song is one of the heavier rock songs on the album. the album overall is a bit darker than hybrid theory (which i love)Faint: i love the cool violin slides on this song. i play violin and i'm trying to figure it out! this song is one of the stylistically different ones on Meteora.Breaking the Habit: chester's voice on this song is amazing....it sorta has a driven quality about it...it pushes forward. i can easily picture it as the music playing during a scene in a movie in which someone is on a mission (building something or something). also if you're one of those weirdos who doesn't like Mike's Rap this song is free from it.Numb: wowza. what a way to end the album. it's beyond awesome. chester's voice is gorgeous at first with Mike softly muttering....then chester starts his trademark grating vocals while  Rob Brad and Phoenix rock out on the instrumentals. i LOVE THIS SONG! Joe doesn't really scratch on this song but he does on some other songs on the cd. good DJ-ing!BUY THIS ALBUM! all of the LP guys have really worked hard and the album is the result of their work. i bought this CD the day it came out and i haven't stopped listening to it since.
After listening to both of their albums I concluded that &quot;Linkin Park&quot; are a band in need of some vocal coaching.  Not only is there music unoriginal and unchanging but also lacks vocal strength from the singer.  Being a musican myself I feel that the vocals are one of the most important elements of a band; therefore this band only deserves a minimum score of 1 from me!I do NOT recommend you spend your precious pennies on this album.
I just listened to the 1st 5 sample cuts and here's some advice:I used to listen to Led Zepplin Aerosmith etc.That was over 25 years ago.Now its occasional classical music or maybe a decent movie theme.This stuff'l wreck your brain.Just a minute OK?Don't scroll away just yet.The angry vocals will predispose you to more anger.And I'm telling you this because I've been 'there'.Now at 46 I've heard all the rock/jazz/punk/rap and all it does is shout down your conscience and prevent you from dealing with life and your own pain.I'm reviewing this because my own 17 year old wants this one and I have to tell him it won't do anything to help him grow into a real man.I'm telling you the same. (Girls with gentleness I'm telling you this trash isn't the pattern you need to follow; boys who grow up to be real men don't sound like this).These excuses for musicians probably wallow in the same epic self-doubt that many of you deal with.Go somewhere else and stop listening to rage and noise.Find sounds that are truly MUSICAL and intelligent.I'd be less than your friend if I didn't tell you the truth even though its unpopular to say it.Be good.With CareA youth worker who knows.Mike
"A very good album. I didnt know alot about Linkin Park since I started listening to the album ""Hybrid Theory"" and ""Meteora"". I thought Linkin Park was horrible. But when I listened to it damn. Was I wrong. Hybrid Theory and Meteora are my favourite albums ever. I listen to these albums almost everyday. And for the people that doesn't like Linkin Park like you guys can do better than them."
Every generation has had a huge star or band to mark its era. Meteora could easily earn Linkin Park's spot in the books. Not only have they seamlessly fused rock hip-hop and techno into one you could take out one or two of those items and still have an awesome band. Chester Bennington has the greatest voice i have ever heard. Not only can he scream incredibly well (it actually sounds musical) he can go soft when he needs to. Mike Shinoda can bust a rhyme better than any other white guy (save for Eminem) and Mr. Hahn is an incredible turn-tableist. ok so heres a quick song review:1.Don't Stay-10/10-simply incredible. this is proof that linkin park could just include rock and still have an incredible band.2.Somewhere I belong-10/10-this song has some of the best lyrics of all time. period.3.Lying From You-10/10-the beat to this song is so catchy that i cant help but love it.4.Hit the Floor-10/10-basically straight rap but the chorus has an insane amount of screaming.5.Easier to Run-10/10-the chorus is impossible to get out of your head but in this case its a good thing.6.Faint-10/10-this is the song that will do it for linkin park. this is song has the best fusion of hip-hop and rock ever.7.Figure.09-9/10-awesome song. no real tune but has some cool segments.8.Breaking the Habit-8/10-this song really shouldn't have been included on Meteora but on a seperate EP. listen to it and you'll understand.9.From the Inside-11/10-this is my favorite song of all time.10.Nobody's Listening-10/10-mainly straight-out rap but the flutes in the backround are pretty cool.11.Session-4/10-can't say this is as good as Cure for the Itch or very good at all but its good break-dancing music.12.Numb-10/10-this was the song that made linkin park popular after In the End. While it doesn't capture the true nature of the band ti is still a really good song.
Linkin Park remains one of my favorite bands to mix rock and metal rap together. This album builds on the strengths of the previous one and adds new factors to lift it a standard higher.I particularly liked 'Numb' and 'Somewhere I belong.' The vocals and rapping go nicely together with the rockish and sometimes techno tune. 'Breaking the habit' was good though it could use some of Shinoda's rapping.But the main thing is that the lyrics are all about negative things such as giving up or being rejected. It would benefit from some deeper lyrics and perhaps a quieter more melodious song.Song music blend is fantastic 5/5 but is pulled down by the good but insufficient range of lyrics 3/5. Overall a good effort and I do recommend it to rock

This album is good but i didn't like all of the tracks. My Favorites:Rolling In the DeepRumor Has ItTurning TablesSet Fire to the RainSomeone Like You
This is one of the best cd's I've bought in a long time this girl can really sing. It's so refreshing to hear someone with a unique voice. Her songs are written by herself and she sings them with much passion. She doesn't have to hide behind silly costumes no studio voice here sounds just as great live too. Hope she is around for a long time looking forward to more.
Adele has the pipes but the music is VERY derivative. There is not a single melody or phrase on this album that wasn't used about a trillion times in the 80's. I cannot stress enough how bad this album is. That it was given the best album of the year by Amazon's editors proves that their ratings are worthless and geared toward middle aged white women.
"While I don't have the time for a lengthy track-by-track review I will say this: I haven't purchased a CD in years -- I prefer buying ""individual"" tracks but ""21"" changed all of that. I purchased the album after hearing Adele's ""Someone Like You"" and it was the best $12 I've spent in a long time. Every track on this album is memorable and encites the love and sadness each of us has so deeply felt at one point or another and every listen feels like the first time."
I loved every song on this CD. Adele's voice is simply amazing and wonderful to listen to. A must have in any music collection.
What a wonderful group of songs that was created by Adele who was just 21 years old at the time! Upon receiving this CD I immediately put the songs onto my MP3 player as uncompressed files.
Bought it because I loved  Rolling in the Deep.  Found a few more songs that I loved.  Good listening recommend.
BEST CD from Adele yet!  Smooth vocals great rhythms.  Adele's distinctive voice is beautiful.  I can't wait to see what &#34;23&#34; holds (if that's the next CD title).  Bravo Adele!
I love Adeles voice and I couldn't wait to get this CD.  It is just as good as I thought it would be.  I listen to it every day.  If you like Adele than you will enjoy this CD.  Shipping was also fast.  Couldn't have asked for more.
I love a voice that is powerful and Adele is that voice.  She makes you feels each song with the voice and words.
I bought this as a gift it is still in the wrapper so nobody has heard it yet. But we know it will be wonderful because we already love several of the songs.
This is a woman who has a voice better than most...and no nonsense music to go along with it. Lots of talent here.
I bought this to total my order over the limit for free shipping and boy I am glad I did...She is definitely a hitmaker with her husky voice...Although I am not a torch song kind of guy she really brings it home on this album...The 3 or 4 hits off this are fantastic but being a rocker I prefer a little harder backup music...It seems a bit Thin to me but I guess that is to set off her voice as lead everything...I'd probably just buy the hits off of iTunes...
absolutely no sophmore slump here.  in fact this may be the best 2nd album ever!  adele has quickly become one of my all time fav singers...and this cd does not disappoint.  i love the whole cd...but the standouts for me are don't you remember someone like you & the cover of the cure's lovesong.  her recent appearances on letterman & ellen...and a slew of other appearances in england...only show how incredibly talented adele is.
One of the best albums in recent time...each track is excellent and worth listening to so definitely smart to get the whole record rather than individual tracks.
I got this for my best friend's birthday. She absolutely adores Adele. Rumor has it this CD is the bomb
Every song is beautiful.  This cd has been the best seller for two years in a row and it's no wonderful considering it's superb quality.  Adele's voice cannot be compared it is in a class by itself..so incredible so beautiful.  She sometimes trembles as she sings her emotions are there for the world she hides nothing back and she has a wicked playful laugh live after and during some songs.  These are love songs to the maximum and many will break your heart and bring you to places you have long since thought you left.  She is THAT POWERFUL.  The memories that come back through the emotion of her vocals are the most beautiful sometimes saddest ride through memory lane.  No matter how many cd's I toss aside Adele is the one I keep coming back to time and time again. Live up to and beyond the hype!! Adele's voice is rich and sexy yet vulnerable and pleading and above all else UNIQUE!
Loved her voiceand as I age one learns to appreciate artists with her talent.A grammy award was deserved.Thank You again.
I can clearly see why this Album walked away with so many Grammys.  Being past the age of 50 in 2012 I was completely blown away when I got to track 10 (Lovesong) being one of the best cover songs out there.  If you've not purchased the entire album you're missing out.  Thank you Adele for making me feel young again.
What an incredible voice!  21 is such a great collecton of songs they all stand out as quality.  I love her voice!
What more can anyone say about Adele. Terrific CD there may be one or two songs that I didn't care for but all and all great listening.
OK this is a good album.  The first two songs are heavy on driving percussion.  Stylistically it's pretty much mostly all much of a muchness.  As she matures I imagine Adele will develop more range.
Adele... love her voice!  All the songs are good.... lyrics melody.  I can listen to this over and over again
I was told that Adele had a great voice but do not really like the CD.
I love this cd.  An excellent cd from an amazing singer.  I think much better than her earlier stuff.ch
Adele is such a great singer full of emotion and this album does not disappoint.  Every time I hear one of her songs it draws out such feeling inside.  This is such a refreshing artist from the world of cookie cutter singers today.  If you haven't bought this yet what are you waiting for?
If I had to choose only 1 CD to buy this year this would be it.  I can't stop playing it.  What a talent!  Love love every cut on this CD.  Bravo Adele.
LIKE HER SONGS HER LYRICS HER VOICE VERY GOOD COLLECTION AND ENJOY IT WHILE DRIVING MY CAR. HGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO ADELE FANS.
"As I was searching for another single I heard on the radio I stumbled upon a sample of ""Rolling in the Deep."" I was so intrigued I forgot all about the other song. I listened to a couple samples from this CD and was hooked - I bought it immediately. I haven't been disappointed - definitely one of my new favorite artists."
I love this album the quality is great and listening to it on vinyl makes it even better! Glad I purchased.
I am in love with Adele.  She has such a great voice.  For being only 21 she has a voice and sound like someone who has been doing this for along time.  I am glad she is no Britney Spears.
I bought this as a gift for my neice. She really enjoy listening to Adele. The package came on time.
Love this whole CD.  There is not a song on there that I don't like.  Will defiantly buy future albums.
I found just what I wanted for my daughter the day before Christmas so I downloaded and burnt the CD in less than 20 minutes and such a good price....I am buying all my music downloads here from now on. Quality sound is great..
From a 61 year old who grew up listening to Dusty Springfield and others from GB I must say this beautiful woman is both a extremely talented writer and a wonderful singer..her talent is unquestionable. And I felt I was in 1968 London during a couple of the songs. And that wasn't a bad place to be...
"This is her second album and it is fantastic.. This gal has such a strong emotional voice its unbelievable.  Hits from the album include ""Rolling in the Deep"" ""Rumor has It""  ""Someone Like You"" and I predict ""Set Fire to the Rain"" will be the next hit off this CD.  ""Turning Tables"" is another great song that has been covered recently. Her great sultry voice and the strong well done instrumentals combine to make this album a ""must have"" in your collection."
Everything was as expected. The one thing that could have been better was some clear indication of when we were to expect delivery.
I haven't been let down yet with Adele's music her albums are part of the rare instances where I like the whole albums instead of just one or two songs per album.  I can't wait to hear what she has in store for us next.
What more can I say about Adele? Just love every song it mekes me cry laught think about differents things. Best music!
Greatsoulfulpowerful The guys and the girls all find something to enjoy with this singers abilities .You will certainly enjoy this album.
I am using Set Fire to the rain in 2 dance classes. This artist is a slow burn with me; it's taking me some time to click. &#34;19&#34; had the same effect.  In contrast Alicia Keys Vivian Green Dido Corinne Bailey Rae Marsha Ambrosius Laura Igzibor got me humming fairly fast
I GOT HER BEST SONGS THE ONES I WAS LOOKING FOR THE SONGS FROM THE RADIO HER OTHER SONGS WELL IN MY EYES SHES NOT THAT GREAT  BUT I GOT MY FAVORITEEEE SOULL TOUCHINNN SONGGGGGGGG BY HERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
It's hard to imagine but I actually like this album better than 19. Adele is amazing there is no way you cannot love this whole cd. There's not a bad song on it.
I think the tracks are too diverse and it made me  wish that I had ordered a 'greatest hit' CD instead - I must be too fickle.
This is one of my daughter and cousin's favorite alblums. She enjoyed both giving it and receiving it last christmas
AWFUL album! One awful song after another with an off-key sounding voice. Straight to the trash can goes that one!
Adele is Awesome! Doesn't matter what she sings her voice is totally HOT! My favorite song is rolling in the deep of which a classical version was made on The Piano Guys hit CD as well as a sound track on the James Bond movie; Sky Fall.
I LOVE THIS DISC. I PLAY IT A LOT WHEN I HAVE TO DRIVE  LONG WAY TAKES MY MIND OFF ALL THE BAD THING YOU CAN ENCOUNTER IN A LONG RIDE. I SIMPLY LOVE THIS WOMANS VOICE!
"After hearing ""Rolling in the Deep"" I was really excited to hear the rest of the music on the album. However I was moderately bored with many of the songs on the rest of the album and there aren't very many stand out tracks."
Bought this for myself but my sister fell in love with the CD so now she's enjoying the music just lover her!
It's Adelewhat more can I say?Good soundpackage intactI play it while working around the housemy canary likes to sing along too.
Adele's music is absolutely wonderful; heartfelt passionate sung with soul.  She writes all her own music and you can tell it is a reflection of her life.
This is one of the few artists that my husband and I can agree on and we both love this album. Even my seven year old son has to listen to it every time we get in the car. His favorite is &#34;Rumors&#34; but he thinks she's saying &#34;Boomerang&#34;. ;D
christmas gift i am sure it will be well listened to and appreciated.  thanks for the great chance to purchase it.
Every song on this CD is a gem. I listen to this CD mainly in the car when traveling.I enjoy every song from beginning to end.
"I am very impressed.  I have not heard music lyrics with such depth and meaning in a long time.  I applaud the work and singing of Adele.  This album shows the remarkable work that only someone who is ""real"" can provide.  The song lyrics provide an insight into how hearts and emotion are tied together.  I have her songs singing in my head off and on all day long.  Great work and a great CD.  Love it."
She's has one of the greatest voices I've ever heard and this cd is exceptional.  EVERY SONG is great and she sings her heart out!
Adele's voice is god given.. What can you say about her and depth of her song writiing.  Enjoying the cd
"Way over rated CD..Forlorn love songsI was really expecting much more due to such the high ratings. She totally butchers the Cure ""Lovesong""..I believe she has great vocal strength and ability but these songs seem not to coincide with it."
We all know how talented and fabulous Adele is.  I play this CD all the time.  Now I'm working on collecting the sheet music!
"Adele is a very talented singer. Her voice has a very blues-like quality that makes you feel the emotions in her songs.The top song on this album is obviously ""Rolling in the Deep"" which I think is her best work so far but it's all excellent. Most of the songs deal with imperfect loves or lost loves and you really feel a hint of sadness or pain in the music. Despite that these songs don't leave you depressed. Overall this is just a terrific album."
I like this album.  It's a really mournful collection of songs.  I don't listen to it much anymore because her music is over played on the radio.
Loved a couple songs and currently in my CD player.Some just a bit bluesy for my taste but all over... good listening. Arrived quick too.
the quality and tone of her voice is exquisite.  the songs touch the hearts of all lovers...the feeling and invocation.  No wonder she is a star.
"I was unfamiliar with Adele until someone performed Rolling In the Deep on ""The Voice."" I loved the song and started learning more. This is my first Adele CD and I absolutely love her voice and her lyrics. So glad I made this purchase!"
"Absolutley amazing ! It's not often I buy a CD and have more than 2 or 3 songs that I actually listen to.  I love every song on ""21""."
What is there not to like? This woman can really sing! The songs are fun to sing along with also.
"Wanted this CD after getting hooked on ""Rolling in the Deep"". There is not a bad song on the entire CD...The styles vary from rock to blues...her voice is awesome her writing from the heart...This is one very talented girl. Didn't care much for ""19"" but ""21"" will make you want to dance sing and cry...GET THIS CD...you won't be sorry"
Tired of overproduced corporate pop?  Where every singer is a shallow plastic-surgeried pin-up?Adele's work is what music should be.
Love listening to this cd. It helps get things done faster! Adele has such a great voice and her songs have great beats.
What can you say about a lady with an amazing voice.  True she needs to give it a rest when it comes to singing about love lost but I guess you have to start somewhere and selling millions of albums tells me that she must be doing something right.
I loved 19 and was excited but nervous about 21.  I have to say that it is even better than 19.  Her voice is just as amazing.  The songs are just as evocative but I find myself wanting to blast the music and groove as well!  I love this CD!
This is the best track of her music. I love Adele. No wonder she got all those Grammy's! I play the song in the car and just cruise!
This item came just in time for me to wrap it for Christmas and that's good service! The item was in really good condition and it was enjoyed right away as soon as it was unwrapped!
Bought this CD as a gift for my mom for CHirstmas. It was requested so she loved it upon opening. I love Adele as well and will be burning a copy of my mom's lovely gift in the near future. * gasp* did I say burn? I mean buy ;) Enjoy!Her sound puts you at a soulful ease. She hits the notes so easy and makes you feel like you can to in the shower. Yea nope..not happening lol.
"Having felt a bit lukewarm about her debut album 19 I was eager to see what Adele's sophomore effort would sound like. 21 feels much like a promise fulfilled. There has never been any denial of Adele's soaring voice. In fact she simply puts most current artists to shame in the days of so much auto-tuning. Adele's producing partners have been a tremendous asset on this album working with the likes of Ryan Tedder and Paul Epworth. Her collaborations have produced a deeply emotional and personal album. You can feel the emotions of each song.From the first track to the last Adele holds your attention and conveys so much power and feeling that it is difficult not to push repeat on each song just to hear it again. ""Rolling in the Deep"" begins with a gospel-bluesy feel. Adele has said that she channels Beyonce's Sascha Fierce when she sings it and it definitely shows. Her haunting voice floats effortlessly over the strong beat. Other standouts on the album are ""Turning Tables"" ""Set Fire to the Rain"" ""Take it All"" ""One and Only"" and the haunting ""Someone Like You"" (though you would be hard-pressed to find a song on the album that is sub-par. Maybe only ""Dont' You Remember"" falls a little flat).Note to artists out there - if you wanna get a great ballad go see Ryan Tedder. With ""Apologize"" ""Bleeding Love"" and now ""Someone Like You"" to his credit he is proving to be a ballad writer like none I have seen in the past two decades.It is hard to believe Adele is only 22 years old. It is exciting to think of how many albums and wonderful singing will come out of her in the years to come. This is easily the best album release of this year and possible of the last 4 or 5 years. It is an amazing display of vocal ability and beautiful sometimes heartbreaking songwriting. A must own."
I'll admit when I bought this album I was jumping on the bandwagon. I'd heard three of Adele's singles off of this album by the time I actually bothered to purchase it and see what else she's got. Turns out I would not be disappointed.One of the first vibes I got from listening to this was that of Carole King. Discovering that Adele at least co-wrote all but one songs on here only reaffirmed that to me. Her voice has such a hauntingly beautiful tone that can both move one to tears and packs a powerful punch to catch you completely off guard. Once I heard that many different demographics were in love with Adele (not just the pop kids of this generation but people in their 60s and 70s who definitely know how to appreciate good songwriting) it gives me hope for the future of the music industry that we could possibly begin to see great musicians rise from the woodwork and try to compete with Adele's talent. Not to mention driving the industry away from the image driven mentalities that so many artists try to front nowadays. Adele is great music and I have no doubt that this album will definitely raise the standards for all musicians hoping to make it as big as she has.
I Love it.  It was bought as a birthday present. It was the best one that I received. It's Great!!!!
I'll admit I had my doubts when I first heard Adele on the radio I really didn't know what to think of her. Now she's kind of grown on me. Her songs are catchy and her demure smoky voice is one of the extreme few that no matter how many time you hear it overplayed on the radio it doesn't get annoying. Jokes aside I highly anticipate the release of her next album. I have no doubt she will be one of the greats. 84
I am enjoying this cd very much. Like with many artists I am just becoming familiar with I find it is growing on my each time I listen.
I have wanted this CD for some time.  I play it constantlyin the car. It contains some great songs - love Adele!!
This is a fantastic album by a terrific artist.  Everything I expected from Adele and more.  So glad I added it to my music library.
delivery was great. I can only listen to this music when I am in the mood for suicide from a love affair. She as a artist is great and inspiring but it is the Vagina Monlogues
I just love this artists works.  She is so easy to listen to. Her music comes from the heart. Very entertaining.
I have to start by saying I am rounding the corner to 50 years old and the last pop album I bought was about two years ago (although I think the classification of this as a modern R&B album is appropriate). That said good music is good music and this is about as good as I've heard in a long long time. Adele is a remarkable talent and the album is full of great songs. Time will tell if this will be one of those timeless classics but based on what I'm hearing this sounds like one to me. Restores my faith in popular music.
I ordered the CD for two songs I had heard on the radio but when I put the CD in my stereo system I was amazed that EVERY song was worth listening to. Her lyrics have so much meaning feeling and passion. Let's not forget her simply divine voice. Adele has one of the most amazing female voices I have ever heard. 19 was a great CD 21 was an even better CD so I can't wait until her next CD is released! I am definitely purchasing the DVD of her concert at Royal Albert Hall. If anyone is contemplating about purchasing any of her music contemplate no more.  Anything of Adele is with more than what it is being sold for. It has been years since I enjoyed every song on a CD...Adele is here to stay!
I really enjoy listening to this CD.  There are some really good songs that I play over & over again while I am alone in my car.  I received my order so fast.  I just love shopping Amazon.com.  I have yet to be disappointed.
What a beautiful voice. This was a gift for a younger person and it was very well received. She specifically asked for this cd so I couldn't go wrong.
I love to sing along to this - it's easy to just pop in the CD and listen to her beautiful music
I had this CD before but due to over use and poor storage on my part I broker it :(.
Adele is the best vocalist I've heard in years.  Her voice is earthy and passionate and her style is very unique.  I recommend this album very highly.
Adele is an awesome singer love her voice! I can't get enough of this cd it's fantastic!!!!! Thank you very much.
Enjoy the majority of her song on this album.  She is such a great singer and her voice comes out so clear.
Maybe I should say the album 'cupped'. None of my other albums are like this so I assume it's this particular manufacturer that's to blame. It sounds great even if misshaped. It's not worth 20 bucks to me to bother with a return but I won't be buying vinyl on Amazon again.
What can anyone say but 'What a voice what a talent what raw emotions and wow!'  Great cd and it did win the Grammy for both Album and Song of the Year.  That says anything.  I bought this for myself and I love it.  Thanks!
I bought this cd with the adele 19 because I really like her music . I'm very pleased with both cd's.
Adele has been a favorite of mine since she first hit the scene.  Her last CD 19 is one of my favorite and most cherished discs as is 21 now.  19 was fantastic and 21 is even better (which I didn't think was possible until I heard Rolling in the Deep).  This CD is ridiculously brilliant!  The lyrics the music and of course her voice.  You will not be disappointed with this CD unless you don't like music.
"Even for ""Baby Boomers"" this is an exciting & good feeling album. I enjoyed the whole album & would buy more of her songs of this type"
I would recommend this CD to anyone. I like the variety from soft and sweet to roaring and fiery!  Awesome!
Love Adele so I loved this product!  Not sure I have much more to say about this product listen to it.
I love adeles music It is down to earth and easy to sing to.  I can't wate to see what she comes up with next.
It is not acceptable for the stinking record company to auto run software that then starts playing the music on their own player when the disk is inserted in a machine. They may think they are being clever and cool but they don't get to drive my PC any more than they get to drive my car. Sony used to do this and they loaded a root kit that hid files from users and allowed malware to conceal itself. NOT COOL. I'd say what I really think of these people but the profanity filter would block it.
WONDERFUL follow up cd to 19.I love every song on this cd.So good!I hope she gets her self admitted alcohol addiction under control and does not become an Amy Winehouse repeat performance.  :o(
AWESOME! ADELE IS A SISTA THAT CAN TRULY SING WITH PASSION AND EMOTIONS YOU CAN RELATE TO! THANKS FOR SHARING YOUR GIFT WITH THE WORLD!
This is an amazing CD I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys music from the heart. Adele's music is something that will be around for years to come.
"I have to start by saying that generally I am more critical of an album that is popular with the masses. Personally I gravitate towards singer-songwriters and songs that are more under-produced than over. However that being said I finally decided to give this album a chance and cannot BELIEVE how much I love it. Another reviewer mentioned that with the handful of songs that are just magical it is hard to keep up that momentum throughout the whole album...but...the ones that are ""magical"" are enough to keep me playing it over and over soaking it in. Highlights for me: Rolling in the Deep Turning Tables Set Fire to the Rain Someone Like You Take It All He Won't Go (Ok maybe I should have listed the ones that are just ""good""). Her voice is original and combined with the songwriting it sounds vulnerable. I think this is good enough to hook people no matter what genre you usually listen to. You can't ignore the flat-out talent."
I gave this to my sister-in-law for her birthday and she loved it.  She it was a beautiful cd. She listens to it around the house as she does her cleaning.  Even my 2 year old niece loves it.
I bought this as a gift for my husband's 65th birthday. (he thinks he is 20) He enjoyed it very much.
I understand why some people might be sick of this CD from hearing certain songs on the radio. But I love it! A great album with a strong voice that isn't the same as all those other popstars. Highly recommended- you'll be glad that you met Adele.
This CD was exactly like what you find in retail stores.  Perfectly happy with the quality of the product - and who doesn't love Adele?
"This cd is going to be a classic!  The first two recordings ""Rolling in the Deep"" and ""Rumor"" has it""...Had me dancing in the kitchen while cleaning up a big mess in the kitchen from a holiday gathering. I was so exhausted but came to life instantly! I must have played these two songs over 10 times! Even my ""miniature poodle puppy was dancing on his ""hind legs!!""....Though the whole cd is ""Totally AWESOME"" I wish there were ""more"" songs with this tempo . Great club songs or for a ""at home gathering""  OMG! SO so HOT!...My first time listening to this gal. She is so ""soulful""....PLEASE please do yourself a favor and purchase this CD...I think its ""much better than her first"" which I  then got on Amazon.com and listened to samples after loving ""21""...ADELE if YOU ARE READING THESE REVIEWS please more of this kind of rockin' tempo  sultry music!! Money ""well"" spent...Not a bad song on the whole cd."
This CD is gorgeous.  The last song Someone Like You is so beautiful.  Rolling in the Deep of course is great.  The thing is all the songs are amazing.  There is no filler.  I kept expecting maybe the next song wouldn't be so incredible but every song on the CD is.  It's a masterpiece.  Adele is a really gifted soul.  Never heard of her before.  I popped this in my car stereo and I was blown away by both her bluesy beautiful voice and the incredibly deep lyrics..love songs yes but they were original and often heartbreaking.  Nothing about this CD is typical.  I recommend this so HUGELY..it does not ever disappoint but it continually amazes.  I'd give it ten stars if I could.
this is well worth the money spent Adele is excellent in it I highly recommend the purchase . . .
She brings forth a singing voice that covers many years of music. From the honky tonks of the 20s right up to the 21st century. She moves you and she can also bring a tear to your eye.  She grooves and touches the far reaches of my soul.  She will be number one on my plays for a long time to come.  Over and out!
Love Love her talent for writing and performance. Coming close to Mariah's  set of pipes. So young and so wonderful already.
I know the songs but this was a gift.  What a better present than the beautiful sound of Adele?  And happy with the delivery and packaging.
What can I say it's Adele.  Not one bad song on the disc.  Seven more words are required but I think I've said it all.
This is a must have.  There is nothing I dislike about this CD. I've been listening to cuts of this for a long time on the radio and finally got it for Christmas.
When I purchased Adele 21 I didn't know what to expect beyond Rolling in the Deep.  But the more I listened the more I liked everything about this album... and every song.  Adele doesn't disappoint.  She leaves you wanting to hear more over and over again of her powerful soulful vocals.  I loved it.
All I can say is... wow. I cannot believe how young this woman is. Her songs and voice are heartbreakingly soulful and wise and her music brings chills to my spine. I am a new fan of Adele and can't wait to see what she comes up with next!
I ordered 3 cds at the same time.  2 came very quickly.  This one took a long time and the case was cracked on the outside and the inside.  I had to get another case to put it in.
Fantastic service & Fantastic singer.  Love the music !!!!  Will be looking for more of her CD's.  She has a terrific voice & terrific songs.
Such a strong voice  that can put all her hurt into one perfect album. I can not wait for the follow up.
I enjoyed this CD - Adele has a very distinctive voice and I may buy another one in the future.
I love love love this CD!. It is great quality sound is fantastic. I play this every day in my van after teaching school. It relaxes me and gets my energy going again! Great talent Adele!
Wasn't crazy about this CD when I first bought it  but after really listening to it   I loved it . What a powerful voice & very heartfelt lyrics ! Highly recommend !
this album has stayed with me until now. every time i go to karaoke with friends this album is always the big hit. Adele 's simplicity and classic style has linked her songs to the contemporary modern living
Of course this album is fantastic.  But what I was writing about was the fact that when this was downloaded to my iTunes it came through as unknown artist - and tracks are only listed by number - there is no name for song.  Annoying.
I give this two stars only because the mastering is so horrible.  If you have a high quality audio system you'll see this right away.  Normal low listening levels for me are -53 db.  I had to set this cd to -60db...it's that loud.  Everything is brought forth bass is muddy highs are flat.  I'll keep the CD because it was my fault for not checking the dynamic range database prior to ordering but I'll give it to my 9 year old daughter to play in her clock/radio/cd player.  Mixing quality aside I like the tracks on this CD.  I'd buy it again if they fix the dynamic range issues.  Google loudness wars...this CD is a prime example.
I really enjoyed a couple songs from this album they were very nice and catchy. The rest of the songs I didn't care for to much.
THIS IS DEFINITELY ONE THAT IMPRESSED ME. I AM A SINGER IN A BAND AND ADELE HAS INSPIRED ME TO REACH TO NEW HEIGHTS WITH MYVOCALS. I LOVE EVERY SONG ON THIS CD AND WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE LOOKING TO HEAR A UNIQUE SET OF PIPES.I ALSO COULD NOT BE HAPPIER WITH AMAZON. THEY GOT THIS CD TO ME IN RECORD TIME. KUDOS TO AMAZON.
I was already familiar with a few of Adele's songs so I just had to purchase this collection!  She's got an amazing voice- you won't be disappointed!
Just like the title says I can't wait until Adele's next CD. If it's any where close to 21 I can only guess what the sounds will be.
Love her music and the clarity of the CD was a great gift for my friend....Great gift item. Love it!
I love Adele. This was bought as a gift because I already owned my copy of it.  It's a great album because all the songs are good to great unkind some artists where only a few songs are worth listening to.
This really isn't my type of music but I heard her song Rolling in the Deep and I instantly liked it. She has a rich voice and it comes out in this song. I ended up getting her whole album and I have to say it's not bad.
This is a great Cd any one would be glad to have it. Adele has a wonderful voice and goes way beyond her years looking forward to what else is to come.
This woman has a voice like no other!  I fell in love with her video busted my PC speakers playing it so loud...  Now I have this to listen to in my car...
Stunning voice.  Adele has few if any peers. I enjoyed the entire album which is a rarity at least for me
This could deserve the best album of year a major competitor of Born this way. Adele's voice sounds just so fine! Every single piece within the album is worth listening. I just kinda wish her next album is not gonna use her age as name of the album lol.
Adele's voice is so refreshing and untouched. Her music is pure and from the heart. This album is a must have for music lovers!
It's so refreshing to hear a talented artist (finally) instead of the likes of Katy Perry and Lady Gaga.  Rather than a distorted voice and practically naked (and weird) music videos Adele refreshes the music industry with a breathtaking voice the likes of which haven't been heard in a long long long time.The genre is quite varied.  Some songs are soul influenced others maybe more pop or even rock.  The main thing is though they are  all fantastic!  I've never bought any music I've enjoyed as much as this.  I purchased this on the Zune Marketplace 3 days after it was released having never heard of her.  I already have over 600 plays of it and it's been something like 4/5 days since.True talent is such a gift in todays music when everything isn't filled with profanity and distortion.  To find a low-key gift like this truly is a blessing.
Beautiful songs sung by a beautiful voice. I really like this album and listen to it all the time. I highly recommend it!
My husband loves Adele & this is the first CD I got for my husband!  He listens to it all the time sometimes driving me a little insane!  Now I know what I put my parents through!
I love Adele's voice and she has so much emotion when singing her songs.  I can't wait for her next release.
This is the best cd I have listened to in a long time. I totally recommend this cd to all.
Really liked the upbeat of her and she has a great unique voice. Really a nice album nice to hear some quality music again!
I love this cd and I love all of the music on it if you like Adele get this CD.!!!!
I absolutely love this cd. I have been addicted to it ever since the first time I heard it. It is beautiful and you can feel the emotion in each word she sings.  She has a beautiful voice.
How in the world can a woman this young write these songs and sing with such gut wrenching soul?  She sings like a woman who has experienced decades of life.  Adele is perfection.  That voice.  Those lyrics.  This CD is awesome from track 1 to the end.
Excellent CDshe has an amazing vocal range very pleasant to listen to think she deserves more airplay time than she has at the moment I also have the Adele 19 CD.
"I have to admit the first time I listened to this CD I wasn't all that crazy about it.  But....after the 2nd 3rd 4th and so on & so on.....I really love it!!  I find myself singing these songs all day.  My favorites are ""Don't you remember"" ""Set Fire to the Rain"" which is my personal favorite! ""One & Only"" - but they are all so very good.Basically I'm glad I did not give up on the CD after the first listen - it really grows on ya!  I keep it on in my office all day long."
It has been a long time since I heard a new artist that mademe stop what I was doing and try to find out who it was. Wow!You can feel every note just like she lived it.
This is a collection of songs that seem to express longing and regret for lost love.  Many of us can relate to missed opportunity and we can think back to what could have been... if only .....Adele brings these words to life with deep feeling and some anguish. For those who are currently struggling with the choices they have made in their life journey these songs could have a deep impact.  On the other hand for those in a &#34;happy place&#34; in their lives I would imagine these could be enjoyable well composed songs.
I really like this cd.  I listen to it all the time in the car.  I love the sound of Adele's voice.  Every song sounds good and I dont have to push the forward button.  Good purchase.
"I got this CD when it first came out stateside. There was a lot of hype over it already and the lucky UK had already been able to enjoy it for about a month. Upon first listen I was disappointed. I do not know why maybe it was the anticipation kept me unable to appreciate the songs or maybe it just truly is a cd that grows on you each and every time you listen to it.I love this cd so much still. Even with the first single getting played out on the radio I still genuinely enjoy every song on the cd. For the first two months it was the only thing I listened to on my way to and from work. Every single day I had a new favorite song. I even truly enjoyed the cover of The Cure's ""Lovesong"". Maybe because 311 butchered it before?If you have someone resisted the urge to purchase this cd relent! I can honestly say it is my favorite cd start to finish. Good work Adele you killed it."
Strong emotional communication.  Adele inspires me to rise above and set fire to the rain and burn off the bad.
Finally young talent that knows how to use her voice! Adele is awesome! Very full of soul I love her music! It is nice to see new young people coming into the music industry that are actually worth listening to!! Adele I am a fan!!!
This is a great album.  All her latest hits.  The price was the most reasonable around.  Even better than Walmart!
"Though Adele had great success with her 19 project 21 is the music soul pleaser of 2011! Not everyone will appreciate the stripped down sound but it showcases the powerful vocal ability and true skill set of this 22 year old singer! Hands down on the album ""Set Fire To The Rain"" is one of the most powerful tracks on the project! Well done Adele. If you can't appreciate this album good for you! It's not meant for everyone but for me it's like a fresh breath of air for the music industry. Again I say well done Adele! Maybe I can convince the Bermuda Government to bring you here for the Jazz Fest....:)"
Loved this album and love her voice. She is one of those artist that has such an unbelievable sound and a winning personality.
I got this quickly and in tact.  I love listening to it Adele is one of my favoite artists.
Adele is simple awesome and this is a great list of music to help pass the day. She is truly a talent!
"If it weren't for ""Rolling in the Deep"" being highlighted on Glee I'd never have discovered Adele and what a treasure I'd be missing. Absolutely fantastic vocals full of soul and heart. Thanks Glee!"
What a wonderful voice Adele has.  She is so great that I would rate her good for anything of hers that I will get.  She is one of the most amazing voices that I have heard from a female singer in a long time.  Hope she continues.
"""Great Service"". The item shipped in a timely manner it arrived in perfect condition and there were no problems whatsoever. Item also had very safe packaging to prevent damages. Thanks"
Great to sing withthought provoking worklove the voice and the creative styleShe sings to inspire you to listen
I have heard of Adele before but had never heard her music until her single Rolling in the Deep came out. This song caught my attention her voice mostly. When I got the album through a friend I thought I wasn't going to like it. Never been into british music like Duffy Winehouse and her. However I was wrong... I love this album from start to finish. The music the lyrics are amazing. The way she sings these song with so much passion. I think Set Fire to the Rain is an amazing record better than Rolling in the Deep. This girl has soul and she is truly talented. You can feel her pain heartbreak and love through her songs. It is an amazing album. I would have to say the best album of 2011.
First time listening to this artist and I enjoyed the majority of it. Her voice and lyrics were very good.
I love this cd.  Adele has an incredibly strong and powerful voice. The absolute best voice I have heard in a long long time. If you love a truely beautiful voice singing fantastic musiclook no further.  You won't be sorry.
An amazing voice for a young woman. The power behing it was not what I was expecting. Love listening to this up loud in the car for long drives.
I was satisfied with this CD loved the music. I would recommend this the CD to my friends. I received this music over a year ago and still listen to the songs.
With today's studio capabilities you can make almost anyone sound like anything. With genuine talent like Adele however there's nothing to do but let her express herself and you know it is going to be magical. That is what you get with her album 21. From beginning to end you are sucked in by her mesmerizing voice and the skillfulness of her lyrics. Adele's talent as a songwriter and a performer merge to create a musical masterpiece that will be able to transcend time and mark it as one of the most genuine albums of 2011.Simply amazing what she is able to do with her voice and we are all the recipients of her gift.
Her best album to date. One of our favorites while taking long drives in the car. We have several copies and have downloaded to our ipads and mp3's.
"Adele is simply amazing in ""21"" her voice is truly a blessing and a gift from above that has been given to her.  I love the interpretation of emotion that she portrays in her songs...she really has soul.  you wont be dissapointed when you listen to ""21"" with songs like ""rolling in the deep"" and ""set fire to the rain"" it is just a journey.  Adele: if you read this thank you. Luv U!!!"
I really don't care for most of her songs - so don't know why everyone is so high one her
One of my favorite CDs of all time! I bought while deployed to Iraq an it arrived in a good amount of time. Adele is truly amazing!
The first time I sat down and listened to the whole CD.... I thought it was great... I'm going to order more of her CD's....
Given the amount of sales & awards of this album who doesn't love this offering from Adele? I know of no one. Song energy lyrics voice is just marvelous & worthy of the awards received!
GIFT FOR MY LITTLE SISTER. SHE LOVES THE CD AND CANNOT STOP PLAYING IT. THINK I EVEN HEARD HER IN THE BATHROOM WITH IT.
Ms. Adele has outdone herself on this cd I can't stop playing her work . Songwriting  vocals &  quality are 4 STARS ....Thanks for coming out with a cd that I don't have to hit the skip button on to enjoy .
This is one of the top 10 albums ever.  Each tract is engaging and different and the  album as a whole is put to together so moving from track to track is seemless.  Adele has such an engaging voice.
get this cd it is her best all the great songs she is the voive of the 21th century her music is so universal and uplifting cant wait fora new album to come out!
Adele is like no other. I love her music her voice and having seen her on various chat shows I LOVE her attitude! She is a classic.
The music is spectacular; this is one of those really great albums.The best news the vinyl pressing is fantastic. Heavy vinyl perfectly flat pop free and perfectly centered. Everything I want in a vinyl album.The album includes a download code for the MP3 files. This is always a fantastic addition to any vinyl release.The album is a simple single opening no gatefold here. The heavy paper sleeve has lyrics and a few more pictures printed on it.A great album that sounds even better on vinyl.
"I absolutely love this album. It's the very first album where I loved EVERY SINGLE ONE of the songs. Adele is beautiful and her music is inspiring. She is going to be making music for many more years to come!Again I loved every track on this album. But my absolute favorites have to be ""Rolling in the Deep"" ""One and Only"" ""Turning Tables"" ""Don't You Remember"" and ""Someone Like You."""
Without a doubt my favorite cd. I could listen to it everyday. This girl has it! I have bought it for friends and family members. No matter someone's taste everyone seems to appreciate Adele.
Adele is a skillful songwriter and has a rich voice.  This album is immediately appealing and is in danger of being overplayed in our house.  Sometimes album's that aren't so 'catchy' at first have a longer play life in the end.  21 can't justy be classed as merely pop though  although it's appealing there is a depth and maturity to this cd beyond her 21 years.
Love this Album; Bought 19 and 21 after hearing of her and sampling some songs. She is going right on to my I-Pod in a playlist I hope she is around for a long time I look forward to a lot more from her. I don't rate someone the best I just have a number of singers who I rate as sort of prima singers she joins Sarah Brightman and Norah Jones in my list. They are both great singers although different as is Adele. I also place Janice Joplin in that group. You might say you can't compair one of these singers to the others which is the point.
How many of these neo soul white British girls do we have to have crammed down our throat? From joss stone amy winehouse duffy and now this chick we have a group of people who are rippingoff black music more then led zeppelin and Clapton ever did but not sounding anywhere near as good. I'm not sure what the media loves about these girls so much that they each have to be the flavor of the month but enough already. For this group Adele is especially bad the songs are as dull as dishwater the structure and lyrics are as formulaic as some American idol cast off album. Her voice is ok but her screechy yelling can't pull off the cheesy lyrics.
"Music has taken a turn for the worse over the past decade or so.  Occasionally there will be an artist or album who will provide a brief glimmer of hope and make us realize that all is not lost.  In 2011 that album was Adele's ""21"" an album of such depth acclaim and impact that one can only hope it will be viewed as a classic in the future.  From the thumping blistering opener ""Rolling in the Deep"" to the quiet sad closer ""Someone Like You"" Adele's voice--and a magnificent voice it is--take listeners through feelings of betrayal sadness and regret.  Songs like ""Turning Tables"" ""Set Fire to the Rain"" and ""Rumour Has It"" run the gamut towering magnificently as centerpieces; Adele also throws in a nicely understated cover of The Cure's ""Lovesong"" for effect.  Each song in spite of covering similar territory is unique has its own voice.  For fans it makes us eager to see what Adele will do next. In the meantime though this album is aging nicely."
Customer service went above and beyond to for a resolution on getting me a great quality product after a mis-ship occured.  Thanks for everything. D.
Excellent album. All cuts are good. No need to ask why she got the grammy. She set a benchmark for herself.
adele's newest album proves that she is no flash in the pan!the songs for this collection are grittier funkier and urban in a way that her debut '19' wasn't.  it is clear that she is not only in strong sure voice but she is also finding her way to some excellent collaborators and producers. they are bringing out the very best in her as an artist. artist. you don't get to use that word often enough with a lot of the current crop of singers. they are circus performers (not to offend circus performers) that go for flash and easily won applause. they don't care if they affect you on a deep level.such is not the case with this disc.my favorite track sits right in the middle--'he won't go'. adele is at her most earthy on this song for me. and what's she's doing is something that pays homage to earthy honest singers like dusty springfield and mary wilson. no tricks--just pure emotion restraint and the gentlest of turns at the end of a note--an occasional note.i also enjoy the first two tracks on the disc=='rolling in the deep' and 'rumour has it'.  they are solid grooves that are perfect for motivating a killer workout or a long trek through the grocery store. speaking of which i should be headed there. so earphones in--'21' on--and systems go!
My wife and Me love country music  but agree that Adele has the pipes to draw you in and deliver the goods. The CD was received quickly and the price was right.
its been a while since I've run into a singer with such power in her voice. her songs are well written too.
Is there anything this Artist does that is not good? I also own 19 and that is a great CD. Adele is an artist with the soul sounds like Jos Stone and a touch of Sara Bareilles and Amy Winehouse in her own style. I am very impressed with her work and so is everyone else who listens to this CD when I have it playing.
This is truly an amazing album. Each songe feels like a life story from Adele's past.  She always sings from her heart and I listen to this so often!
Adele 21 has the best Adele songs in my opinion. She is a talented entertainer and it shows in this album.
Adele is a fine fresh artist with a powerful voice and the songs on this album are musically wonderful.  Unfortunately it has apparently been mixed for listening on an mp3 player i.e. highly compressed.  The sound quality on a good stereo is abysmal.  Everything every instrument every frequency is the same volume loud and harsh.  Unlistenable.  It even sounds terrible in a car.
This lady can sing. She has strong vocals and beautiful voice. You just have to be in the mood to her all of the CD..The most popular tunes on this CD are very good.
"I had very high expectations for this album and I absolutely LOVE ""Rolling in the Deep"" but after the first few songs it just starts to sound the same.  Adele's voice is fabulous and smokey but it becomes the same after awhile and the songs start sounding alike. I had a good friend who considered Amy Winehouse to be a great talent but all I hear is a voice ravaged by drug addiction.  Adele should quit smoking wise up and quit being so bitter.  I think her music would benefit from a little more experience. People are praising her so much right now and I think she'll hit her peak about four albums in. Not quite there my dear but you'll get there soon."
But what depth of feeling (Rolling in the Deep) and passion (Set the Rain on Fire).She puts to words all the range of emotions and feelings that anyone in love that has been wronged or cheated on experience.Wisdom and eloquence beyond her years.  Truly a complex individual.  I wish her well in her quest for true love.
"I can't really add much to the current ""most helpful favorable"" review of this CD (that review is titled ""Beautiful"") so I will just refer you to that reviewer's comments.I can say however that this is one of the most creative beautiful examples of fine music that I've every heard and Adele's voice and talent have reached new vibrant & powerful levels.I have no doubt but that she will be increasingly recognized for her enormous vocal talents and lyrics.  No one is going to be disappointed by this CD!"
Everybody had been on me to get this saying that if you like music you will like this. And they were right. And so were almost one billion people who have this or have seen her perform or who have listened to the radio. Every single cut off this recording is wonderful. I don't have to recommend this. I believe it is already made its mark.
I listen to everything. All genres all time periods. If it's good I like it. This album by Adele is an instant classic.  It is simply mesmerizing and if her emotion doesn't take you to a different place when you listen to her I'm not sure whatever will. Powerful lyrics sung with a level of hunger and passion that I've rarely heard from any artist before.  Adele's version of the Cure's Lovesong is remarkable. And I loved the original.  I'm not a reviewer that goes through and gives a take on each song though I do appreciate the time and thoughts of those reviewers. Rather I look at a work of art as a whole.  So this is it... If you truly enjoy beautiful music with a heartfelt story sung flawlessly then just buy this CD. Trust me. Do not cheat yourself by just downloading Rolling and Someone get it all.  You will listen to the whole album over and over I promise. It's that good.
"I heard a song on the radio... on a ""pop station"" my daughter listens to... I turned it up and thought how 50's or 60-ish the music sounded. It was old R&B type music and vocals with modern recording and production techniques.  That is Adele. I'm amazed that such a talent based in soul rhythm & blues has achieved a chart topping single! There's hope for real music and artistry after all.  Adele is not the youth pop icon set out in front with manipulative marketing but an ""old soul"" in a young persons body. Her songs aren't bought and paid for but an expression of her true self and her originality. Recorded and produced as they should be not spit shined to slick for the masses. She is absolutely beautiful unique and a breath of fresh air in today's music. Hopefully her success will grow and open doors for other such talented but ""out of the mainstream"" artists."
"As someone who has often been disappointed by the current state of Pop music which seems to be dominated by artists with little talent short careers and a lot of hype thanks to shows like American Idol.  Adele is a big exception who actually became popular because she has real talent and her music is very refreshing.  I enjoyed her first CD but I think 21 will rank as one of the nicest pop CDs of 2011 and proves she has staying power.  She has a beautiful soulful voice.  Her songwriting skills are excellent.  21 has a nice mix of happy and sad love songs.  Favorites include ""Turning Tables"" ""Set Fire To The Rain"" both are beautiful passionate love songs  She does a great cover of The Cure's ""Lovesong"".  This is one of those CDs that you can listen to and not want to skip over any of the songs."
I love listening to Adele. The price on Amazon was the best on the Web. The CD is best quality and now I can enjoy listening to Adele all day.
What an amazing voice!  Bought this CD after hearing one song and simply fell in love!  Fabulous young woman with great talent.
"This is a great CD from beginning till end.  It is a good addition to ""19"".  Buy now. Don't have anything else to say.  If it does not post this time I will cancel my review.  LOL"
what a voice. hit after hit after hit on this cd. glad it wasnt overpriced but feels like you should have had to pay more with that many great songs.
Like I said in the title this is a good album but not an outstanding one. Once you get past the singles - with Someone Like You being the stand out track - most of the other songs are good but not great.Adele certainly has a wonderful voice but the album is hardly groundbreaking. What we basically have is a collection of songs that wouldn't sound out of place on a Dusty Springfield album from the 60's updated with a 21st century production.Don't get me wrong it's an enjoyable listen and at times her voice can send shivers down your spine but there's not enough originality there to really excite me.
The entire album is fantastic.  I guess Adele's 6 Grammies speaks for itself.  I bought a Mini Cooperconvertible just after I got this and I will always think of her when riding with the top down.
I Love Adele. What a beautiful voice and incredible song writing. I never thought an artist from this generation would become my all time favorite female musician. I'm only 20 years old but i listen to classic rock and female musicians such as Stevie Nicks Janis Joplin Aretha Franklin etc. It is such a relief to finally get a mainstream artist with actual talent! I don't see how any REAL music fan could dislike Adele. She has saved music and deserves every grammy she won this year. I hope she sweeps the grammys again next year! I will forever be a fan!
I have really enjoyed this CD.  No fillers - just great songs.  I love her music.  The music is great but I also think her lyrics touch the soul.
GREAT CD - great price !!!!  Fast service and good condition.  I get all of my CDs from Amazon.
This is one CD NO ONE should be without.  She has an amazing smoky voice.  The messages in the music are amazing.  A young person with an old soul.
Love her voice.  I think that 21 so an amazing album...so many of the songs have become hit singles! Marvelous
Great cd with several &#34;big&#34; hits.  This girl is blessed with a big voice and huge talent.  The cd is clear and I rate it high.
This is my first Adele CD.  I heard this voice on the radio and just had to find out who it belonged to.  Really good CD.  Every cut is good.  This young lady has a rare gift.
This is the best overall album I've bought in a few years.  Every song sticks in your head.  Adele sings from her soul and you don't just hear every note - you feel it.
The recipient loves this cd. Added bonus was that I got a free download. I am not a religious fan of hers but I have enjoyed listening quite a few times and she has an amazing voice no doubt.
I play this often. It's much more polished than Adele 19. I'm glad she got her voice back. It would have been a big loss if Adele could not sing anymore.
I don't purchase a lot of music but her story was one that I could relate to. Her music and accent made these songs so amazing. Loved it!
Wow. What a voice. Love to play this CD loud alone in the car. Can't wait for another new CD from her.
This is a very good CD.  My first purchase from this artist.  Of course I have a favorite song but I am enjoying the rest of the album as well.
I love this CD and have played it over and over.  It's a great CD to pop in while I am driving to the coast.
Must admit  did not appreciate what a remarkable voice she has....till now.  Pleasently surprised to like most every song on the cd !  That`s  rare !
Only rarely do I purchase an entire CD otherwise I purchase each song as a single from another source. When I heard Adele singing Rolling in the Deep I was compelled to purchase the CD. There is only one or two other artists or groups that I would willingly purchase an entire CD. Adele's voice is soulful deep and meaningful. All her other songs have me raving about her voice and singing along. Her passion runs deep and it flows out through her music. I look forward to her next CD!
This is one of my favorite albums.  It is on my ipod and is my &#34;go to&#34; album when I feel like ranting but too inarticulate to put the words together...
I LOVED EVERY SONG!!! BUY IT!!! IT&#34;S WONDERFUL!!! Adele is on fire. I think every age bracket will love it. &#34;21&#34; is a must have.
I've never liked a Cd so much all of the songs are absolutely Amazing it's a must buy Cd !!!
This album is great for a gift. I purchased it for myself and liked it so much that I purchased another one for my sister. You'll enjoy every song!!!
I can and I do-  listen to this CD over and over again.  Almost daily I walk outdoors for an hour; sometimes longer sometimes less.  During the course of my walk for months now I am compelled to (Ms.) Adele 21.  Great CD!
Once more I own this CD and purchased it as a birthday present for a friend.I knew what to expect.
Love the music. It is definitely her best album. We have worn out the first CD and ready to buy a second. Can't get the music out of your head!
Great voice great writing. Adele is talented and beautiful. Sucks to have a broken heart been there but so great that it created such beautiful music.
This was a Christmas gift for my daughter in law. She absolutely loves it. I have not heard the album so this is second hand.
Love Love Love Adel.  Great voice.  Wonderful music.  Great to sing along with.  I think it is very stupid that I have to write a certain amount of words to do a review.  I WILL NOT BE DOING ANYMORE REVIEWS BECAUSE OF THAT!!!!!!!!
If you really like the unique voice of Adele you'll really like this CD.  It has lots of soulful tunes for when you in that kind of mood.  The CD arrived quickly and was in good condition.
This was a gotta have CD for anyone who is into the music the voice and the lyrics.  I found this to be a better CD than 19 but that is my personal choice base upon my musical likes. A must have for anyone's collection.
Gave this to my daughter for her birthday and she absolutely loves it and keeps it in her c.d. in her car and listens to it all the time.  thank you  great doing business with you...
Adele cd  was better than I expected everyone and anyone should have this CD in there music collectionthe first track is my most favoritebut the rest of the CD is great too.
"I loved the song ""Running in the Deep"" when it played on the radio.  The beat just grabbed me.  I had no idea who the singer was.  Then I saw Adele sing the song on TV.  I was pleasantly surprised when I saw the big girl with the big voice. not a size 2 fashion model.  I decided I wanted to hear more so I checked out the samples of ""21"" on Amazon.  I thought they sounded good enough to buy the CD.  I really like this album.  Adele has the soulful voice of Janis Joplin without the screaming.  I am very happy I purchased this item."
I have been listening to this for almost two days now and it is addicting.  She has a voice that is so unique and colorful.  She can touch your soul if you let her. There is a depth there that is not heard [Set Fire to the Rain] very often by current artists.  I look forward to her next set of songs.  Keep up the GREAT work Adele ~~
Her voice is beautiful and it's a great cd. It's a very moving cd. Her voice is so clear. thanks
she is so good so much better than Taylor swift who wins so many awards glad to see in todays news Adele won a bunch and one from the Queen . My grandsons little band plays rolling in the deep and all the kids love it!!
I love Adele. Anything Adele. I love her voice and all her songs period. I'm a big fan. I could listen to her anytime
I gave this a 5 star was well shipped and packed well ty .well pleased shes a great singer! love her music!
I love to hear Adele sing - she's amazing!  Sure wish she'd get back in the studio and get another album out!!
I love Adele. I love her sence of humor and ecpecially her music. I hope she keeps coming out with more.
I started to listen to some of these tracks to see what all the fuss was about and couldn't believe how above average this music is. I've heard better at high school talent shows and on Idol.  Wow. How much has the music industry has fallen? Worthy of MP3 quality.  I'm saving my money for something else.Jim Tavegia
Wondeful CD! Love it and her! Real favorite and a great addition to my musical library and life. High recommend
I purchased this CD for me and my dad and we both love it! I should've bought it much sooner!
Love love love this CD.  Adele is great and her voice is magnificent.  Her range is extraordinary.  Would definitely recommend this.
There are no words other than the 'Amazing Album' Adele's music truly inspired millions of people including me...The voice is just ahead from the normal vocals the emotions the lyrics all makes the 21 a must have collection in the music library. As I've read on Wikipedia the 21 was made when Adele was 21 year old and she's perfectly describes the emotions love hurt peace harmony betrayal... all in one Album ...Waiting for her next birthday and alongside album....Hats off to the British singer.
Love Adele and these songs.  Turning Tables is my favorite.  Music is an emotional thing for me.  I either connect emotionally or I don't and I completely connect to her voice and these songs.
There is nothing to dislike about this CD! I played it at a party and people of all age groups loved it (from my 14 yr old niece my mother all the way up to my 71 year old grandmother. We were all singing along and we all knew the words! I would recommend this as a gift due to its broad range of listeners. It's a very enjoyable CD. Adele 21 is definitely a crowd pleaser!
Adele is just one of the greatest singers and songwriters ever.  I love her sultry voice and he ability to carry the song with out the necessity for musical accompanyment  Can't say enough about her.
It is simple my granddaughter sings her song every time she heres it......Brings tears of joy to my heart....
This is the second one I bought - lent the other to a friend oh well.  But now that I can get this with Amazon cloud that much better
Love this cd much better than 19.  Several great songs on this cd am hoping she will be touring again soon.
I don't need to repeat everyone's praise for the album; the sales numbers and the numerous awards say it all.
The most beautiful soulful collection on 1 C/D. I can't stop listening to her. I want more of her music and will shop here for them. Thank you Amazon for making my life easy. Thanks Adele! Big fan!
I was amazed by the sound and her vocals of this album. This album shows her coming of age. This album is a collection of deeply personal songs finely wrought and powerfully delivered which communicate the power and glory of real love and real heartbreak through a range of musical moods and settings. This is a musical and emotional tour de force a portrait of the artist as a young woman coming into her own.
There is nothing like belting out Rolling In the Deep as you're driving down the road!  I love this CD!
I picked this album up back in July following its success in the first half of 2011 and have never regretted it. There isn't a bad song on the album and it plays on your emotions like no other album I've listened to. Five months after first hearing it it's still the first album I look to when I want to listen to music.
There is no question as to why Adele is setting the world on fire.  Today's generation has not yet seen or heard a genuine musician period let alone someone as talented as this woman.  At only 23 years of age (currently) Adele has created the most refreshing groundbreaking pop music album in at least a decade.  '21' contains all of the ingredients which make up a truly memorable album: captivating lyrics vocals so raw and honest your heart will race and your eyes will tear upon hearing them perfect musical arrangement and melody throughout each song and last but not least diversity.  No two songs sound alike. Instrumentally some may sound similar but each song dynamically changes throughout making this entier album a true feast for the senses.  In my opinion Adele is the most interesting talented and promising up-and-coming R&B/pop star of this era without a doubt.  This is a very special album an instant classic.  You will not be able to stop listening to it in its entirety.  It will hit you hard and will seem as though you are listening to a musician of the mid-1900s.  True soul music.
Enjoyed the songs I heard by Adele on the radio and different TV programs . Knowing that often only the best tracts are selected for distribution I decided to purchase her CD 21 anyway. I was very pleased. Her voice and the song selections are all great and I have been enjoying listening to it.
I don't think there is anything new I can say about Adele.  She has a true voice that doesn't need any kind of mechanical manipulation to sound good.
I like this CD and all the song is really good and the voice of Adele its really unique!even in my office in my car i bring this CD in my house in my laptop i keep on repeating this CD its tell the meaning of LOVE!
How do you top amazing?  Adele did here with her follow up of 19.  For fun watch the SNL skit with Emma Stone as Adele's song is the topic.
I had heard this album before I bought it so I knew that I would like it.  There are a variety of beats and a consistent quality to her voice.  I enjoy the album and would recommend it.
"it is an easy album to listen to every single song.  Originally I was just going to download ""Rolling in the Deep"" but I am very glad I downloaded the whole album."
Adele is a phenomenon with a unique and mature sound hard to believe her age. Another of the contemporary British greats but in a class completely of her own making. She asks us to rise up and listen to her rather than making herself what she thinks others might want to hear - with extraordinary result.
There are very few albums out there where every song is good but this is one of them. This woman has one of the best female voices out there. Even better than her voice though is her music. Her songs pack a lot of power. This is a great addition to any collection.
"I heard Adele sing for the first time by accident while watching the Jimmy Kimmel show... A few days later went to her website and sampled her videos and some other songs...and I was hooked.Purchased her ""21"" CD and I simply can't stop listening to it.Adele aside of being beautiful has a very strong and extremely versatile voice.Her songs take the listener from her feelings of revenge to total forgiveness from her confusion and desperation from not knowing what went wrong to hope that love will come back to her some day.Although the songs are about the the same ""broken heart/heart ache/still in love with the wrong person"" the music and the way sings them make the album be very entertaining and upbeat. Different from and very opposite to any regular ""sappy/cheese/boring ballad"" type of album.Great album all around."
Great album unfortunately it got stuck in my cars rapid changer and I'm unable to use itAdele is amazing. Dohlol...
I'm a big fan of Adele and this CD did not disappoint. Like it very much and listen to it often. Such a great voice and great lyrics from the heart!
One of my favorite artists can't wait to see what she releases next. Will definitely be getting her previous albums.
Adele never disappoints.  What a voice...love the music.  Buy this one and you will enjoy the music for hours. Recommend.
It makes one sit and absorb her beautiful voice close your eyes and think wonderful thoughts.  An absolute must have!!!
Not much to say.  Listen one time to Adele and it is all said.  I am an ecclectic music lover.  I tend to like the voices that are immediately recognized and Adele is right up there with Stevie Nicks who has been my favorite forever.  Music words voice can bring me to tears.
"Adele is singing from somewhere deep within herself on this CD.  Every song will bring someone to mind that has come into your life and made you feel some kind of way.  At first listen I wasn't too fond of it because I'm a ""beats"" person so usually if the beat isn't great I'll pass on it.  I listened to ""Don't You Remember"" one day when I was just relaxing and I'll be damned if I have not been hooked every since.  I have one CD for the house and one for the car.  My favorites are ""Rumor Has It"" ""Don't You Remember"" and ""One and Only"" but I love the CD in its entirety.  Adele is on and inviting you to a whole new level of feeling and I am glad to up there with her.  If you have not heard it...you are so late.  Stop reading and order or just got it all ready you won't be disappointed!  I can't wait to get in my car and hit repeat...."
I JUST GOT SAY ABOUT THE ALBUM I REALLY LOVE ALL THE SONG ON THE ALBUM THEY ARE REALLY HOT AS HELL HER VOICE IS ON FIRE
"I'm really in love with this album Adele did such an amazing job!  It is very soulful but yet still moves along quite nicely.  My favorite songs on the album are ""Someone Like You"" ""Turning Tables"" and ""Take it All"".  These songs are so comforting and emotional they are played on repeat in my car haha.  I'm also in love with the music video she made in her home for ""Someone Like You"" her interview almost made me cry (and I'm not single) and her accent is adorable!  I also love that she's not a sellout but stays true to herself.  This is defnitely one of those albums worth purchasing the entire album for not just 1 or 2 songs.  Adele makes beautiful music I can't wait to see what else she comes out with for a ""23"" album!  YOU ROCK ADELE!!"
I am on a fixed income it is very hard to make monthly ends meet on the tight budget that I have.  That is why I usually check Amazon  Books and Music for any entertainment needs before going to  a retail store.  I love my cd 21 by Adele I purchased it just after she won  the grammy for it and I love it! It was new but I purchased it as used. Dora Stokes
I bought this album along with her previous album (19) and the DVD of her concert at The Royal Albert Hall in London and loved all three. The order arrived well ahead of schedule which impressed me greatly. Adele's music is absolutely breathtaking and beautiful. Nearly every song she writes has a story behind it which I think gives the songs additional significance. Nearly every song on the album has a story behind it from the aftermath of a nasty argument (turning tables) to reconciling with an old flame (someone like you) to reacting to an ugly rumor (rumor has it). All the songs are delivered with a voice that reaches right into the heart of me and pluck at my own emotions. I'm not ashamed to say it but one or two songs did leave me teary-eyed. Anyway I loved this album and simply can't wait for the next one.
I'm so happyfinally there is someone who can sing.And write pretty songs to!Recently we have mostly garbageI don't even know how to call today's music-is it music at all? In all that there is one girl who can write and perform.Very professional  DM
Thanks. Came very quickly exactly as ordered. Very haappy that both CDs ordered came in the same order package in great condition.
I ordered and received Adele 21 and was more than amazed.The songs were so groovy :-)I would definately recoment it to friends and family.Loved the bonus songs even better
I love Adele's music and this CD has a lot of her hits. She has a very unique voice and just very talented.
This cd is awesome. I haven't found a song I don't like she has an amazing voice~ Received this in the time that was guaranteed.
Adele's voice is so good.  I listen to this CD more often than any other CD I have ever owned.  Not a huge fan of tracks 1-2 but there are still ok.  Love 3 and beyond.Whoever broke her heart I thank them because it caused her to produce such good music its crazy.
Adele is just SO good! She sings in such a compelling way and I keep listening to it over and over..
I was wondering when someoneanyone would put British music back to where it belongs.........at the top of it's game.When we can get our act together we are untouchable. Adele has achieved this feat with such aplomb. What song writing clever melodies delicious lyrics it's all there in this CD. And as an added plus she is so down to earth with that heavy London accent.Yes Darlin' I know all about Shepard's Bush and Hammersmith.Let's hope she can keep her feet on the ground and become the superstar that is within her grasp.I've just bought the Blu-ray DVD of her concert at the Royal Albert Hall another stunning performance.Can it get any better than this ?Enough said !!
Outstanding album from a real artist.  Strong vocals with some catchy tunes combine to make a great album.  A fresh breathe of air in a music industry that is so infatuated with synthesized sounds and processed vocals. She has an incredible voice and I for one am hoping she'll be around for many years to come. I highly recommend this one.
"21 is the album that won't stop selling the musical gift that keeps on giving. After adding 5m sales since the start of 2012 making it the likely biggest album of the year aready nothing seems impossible for this juggernaut. 21 is rapidly hoovering its way up the All Time 100 Album chart devouring iconic artists and albums in its path (Carole King Tracy Chapman Led Zeppelin George Michael Michael Jackson et al). On current projections 21 probably won't pause for breath until it's well into the Top 30 a remarkable achievement in the age of digital downloads and file sharing networks.How has this come about? Having defied all the genres genders age brackets to reach its present supremacy the focus is as always on the vocalist with THAT voice but also increasingly on her writing skills which have are increasingly differentiating Adele of late from her contemporaries. It's the sheer quality and freshness of her songs that have not only resisted listener fatigue after the statutory couple of dozen plays but indeed have triggered a wave of global Adele addiction (adelation?) if the music blogs tweets and reviews are anything to go by. Half the population seem to have 21 and/or 19 on permanent rotation.The most common criticism of 21 tends to focus on the alleged repetitiveness/blandness/weakness of its non-single tracks with one reviewer even comparing 21 unfavourably (and incorrectly) to Amy Winehouse's ""Back to Black"" which also offers a tableau of similar-ish sounding songs. So what's the beef - isn't this called having artistic style and identity? Its like saying Dark Side of the Moon is a lousy album because it has a unifying concept that shaped the overall sound. Doh?! As for ""weaker"" or ""filler"" songs on 21 this is simply not the case as many of them (Turning Tables One and Only Take It All Lovesong) have YouTube plays running into millions.  Anyway who can remember the names of the non-single songs from the albums of almost any other major artist? No I thought not...Another occasional bewildering claim has been over 21's alleged sub-standard recording quality/mix. Even a cursory play on a high-end hi-fi or earphones (like Etymotic's excellent hf3's for iPhone) put the lie to that. The Neumann mikes used to record 21 are the gold standard for capturing warm natural vocals while the mix balances her voice against the backing perfectly with a great stereo soundstage that places Adele's vocals almost uncannily into the room. Where effects like reverb are used such as on Set Fire to the Rain its done intentionally for a particular artistic effect not as a way of hiding vocal shortcomings unlike many of her contemporaries whose voices are doubled or tripled before being auto-tuned and otherwise digitally post-processed to death.Now back to Adele's voice which is where it all starts and ends. A Dusty Springfield profile on TV the other day proved that as great as Dusty was (and still is) she didn't write her own material and her voice didn't have the emotional or technical range of Adele's even later in her career. Adele's much discussed appoggiaturas (Wall Street Journal etc) are only a small part of her artistic arsenal which also includes unique self-taught vocal control that rivals the great singers like Etta James Ella Fitzgerald Sara Vaughn and Billie Holliday all of whom she studied assiduously during her own early development. Adele has already joined that pantheon. In the light of 21's chart topping sales figures well after a year of its release global opinion increasingly appears to be reaching the same conclusion."
Don't know what to say except that she is amazing!  Had heard a few tracks on the radio that I really liked - but love all of the songs.
The product was shipped as ordered and arrived in new condition.  I took a chance on this CD and did not preview. I found the sound harsh and could not finish listening to it.  Amazon allows previews.  This is one you should preview.
Excellent CD!  I purchased this CD because I like the song that receives radio play and I was pleasantly surprised to find that every song on the CD is excellent.  Adele has a very strong voice with wide range and emotion.  She has song writing credit on most of the songs and is clearly a very talented artist.  I recomment this album to anyone that likes her radio song.  You won't be disappointed!
The vinyl copy of this album sounds infinitely better than the CD version.  In fact after hearing the vinyl I threw my CD copy away - the CD is compressed.As for the work itself?  One side is great - all the hits all the good work. The other side isn't even worth listening to.  Old story of an artist with enough quality to cover about 20 or so minutes - but has to stretch it with filler to have something for the &#34;other&#34; side.Good voice great emotional connection good backing band good arrangement (though heavily compressed on the CD).
Just got this and loved all the songs. Came quickly and in perfect shape. I am going to sample her other album to see if worth buying as I am not a freeloader.
Definitely a seller that I would buy from again.  Did not have to contact seller and everything was sent on time and as described.
No problems here. I waited forever for this to go on sale and finally just got it. It is worth the money. Adele is awesome what a voice and the CD arrived right on time as promised. Excellent job!!
Need I say anything.  As everyone else has shown by by the awards she received an absolutely great voice variety of styles and an unique person.  Hope more follows!!!  The CD was new and perfect as advertised.
To be honest I don't like all that new music coming out those days all sounds the same to me. But this one is different! Great performance many great songs.
This is an amazing performance and album.  I listened to it on my hifi system and noticed layers of subtlety that you just don't hear on the radio.  I can definitely see why she won so many awards for this.
I love Adele's music so I wanted this CD.  I run an older stereo system with a CD player at our cabin so this CD is going there.  21 Adele has 3-4 of her most popular hits but some very nice less popular songs as well.  This is a good product and I got great service.  Thank you Amazon.com.
Adele is AMAZING! I can relate to every song from beginning to end of this CD. She deserves every Grammy nomination that she has recived for this masterpiece.  This will definitely go down as a classic album for me.  You will not be disappointed with this album! BUY IT TODAY!!!
This cd has many of Adele's great songs.  Very enjoyable to listen to. I would recommend it to any Adele fan.
Best purchase i had ever made. Money well spent. This cd is always on replay for me. My song is &#34;I wont go&#34;. Every time i listen this cd i cry.  I jus love her voice and how she speaks to me with her words.
I love this cd.  Sorry I took so long to rate it.  If you like Adele you are asking where is her new one?  We want Adele.  For those who love her mucic we are left without Adele 23.  She did one 19 then 21.  We know she had baby and needs a private life but we are just fans that want more from her we love it we want it.  Fans can be inconsiderent we just want our Adele.  Let us be a bit more fair about this and give the parents and baby time to get a good bond going!
I keep finding more and more songs on this album to love.  Adele's voice is so interesting and the songs really accentuate that voice.
Adele has a voice that demands attention....I will be blunt--cannot stand most music; very picky. I heard Adele for the first time on some radio station and she completely took my attention....amazing voice. This album rocks!!! I love just about each song...powerful beautiful haunting. get it.
"There were two artists I was waiting for CD's from this year.  Aimee Duffy and Adele Adkins...Duffy's second CD was rough at best entirely disappointing.  Adele's cd on the other hand is an artist in the making.  From the first song ""Rolling in the Deep"" she sets a tone of great music and great writing.  The best songs ""Set Fire to Rain""""He Won't Go"" ""I'll be Waiting""and ""Someone Like You"" all show great maturity as an artist and songwriter.  But the absolute gem on this album is ""One and Only"".  I would buy this cd just for this song alone.  This second cd is very different from the first as it is not so acoustic and personal.  The theme of love lost on this cd demands a different approach and Adele totally nails it with her voice and production.  With so many mediocre cd's out there it is really great to hear an artist that is soaring in creativity."
The is the best CD I have bought in years. The songs are meaningful and a treat for the ears. I played this CD so many times.
All I can say is GREAT! Fabulous music. Highly recommend.  Sorry she is going into retirement for a while.
The CD is great.  The songs are easy to listen and catchy; Adele's voice is unbelievable. I have been playing it ever since I received it.
What can I say? Love Adele and this album shows why she is a true star. Could listen to this all day.
I cant belive this album!  I bought it for Rolling In the Deep but ended up listening to all the songs almost immediately.  This album is really heartfelt and I love all the emotion in it.
Adele is an awesome singer with a great voice.  She has soothing melodic voice with a wide range.  You won't be disappointed.
Great music and a great singer. I'm 65 and I rock 'n roll in my car while playing it! Highly recommended.
Adele is a powerful and talented singer and this CD showcases her abilities. i bought a copy as a gift and after hearing her song 'Someone Like You' I purchased a copy for myself.  Wonderful!
I didn't think much of the songs off this album that I heard on the radio. But when I heard the whole CD from the library I loved it. It is an excellent album and really has great songs that show off Adele's range of talents.
I have been in awe of Adele since her first album 19 and i think 21 is her best yet. The CD arrived on time and intact.
Short review.Its a great Album that is not to be missed.My kids know all the words simply great music.
I liked every single track on this cd!  Had to listen to it twice right away as I was hooked on Adele's voice and music.
I knew I had to have this CD after hearing just a portion of it in a commercial.  AT the time I had not heard it on radio.  What a voice and talented writer.
Adele is truly gifted with that fabulous voice and those great songs she sings....especially Rolling in the Deep.What a treat to listen to everything on this CD.  Truly wonderful.
The best CD I've purchased in a long time.  If you like Adele you will be happy!  I'm still listening to it several times a week.
She doesn't sound like all the others; has a deep soulful voice. Each song is a different beat and rhythm. Could listen to Adele all day.
"I wasn't wild about ""Chasing Pavements"" so I didn't pay a lot of attention to Adele's first effort ""19.""  Things changed with this CD.  I absolutely love it!  It has such a rich bluesy feel to it.  Some of my favorites aren't even the singles (""Rumour Has It"" ""One and Only"").  Of course the masterpiece of it all is ""Set Fire to the Rain.""  I can't get enough of that one and I love Adele's delivery.Overall I'm well pleased with this product.  In fact I'm such a new fan that I think I'll give Adele's first CD a listen."
I fell in love with her album 19 and have been blown away by her performances.  But 21 is absolutely amazing and a joy to listen to.  I love Rolling In the Deep but after a couple of listens to the rest of the music He Won't Go is now my favorite song ever! I am wearing out my music player and disc player in my car with this record. I bought the album because of Rolling In The Deep but I was caught completely by the rest of the album! If doubt about what good music is please purchase find a place of solitude and enjoy. You will be reminded what music is suppose to be. I promise you won't be disappointed! Cheers!!! I am off to listen again. Where's the repeat button!
Adele is great and my mom likes her as well. She requested this CD and got it from me. She was very pleased!
the CD was great.  it came quickly as promised.  the only thing strange about it is that the information encoded on it is for the wrong cd.  instead the information came out for a snow patrol album.  makes it kinda hard when it's in my digital music player. so i don't have any of the correct song names or artist digitally.  but the music itself is superb.  adele is incredibly talented and her songs really showcase the power of her voice.
This CD is so excellent the maids who clean my house made off with my copy.... so I had to get another one.  My birds and I listen to this CD almost every day.  Adele's voice is so powerful and beautiful.  What a voice!
I love  Adele's voice and she really hit the top with this CD. I bought it for myself and my little great granddaughter knows all the words and she is only 5. I would say that this is great music if it appeals to  4 generations in one family.
There is nothing I can add to what others have already said.  Adele is a phenomenal talent with a once in a lifetime amazing voice.  I hope she makes another album soon.
great cd was all i thought it would be.  Advise to anyone.  Did not know she had so many albulms
THe CD got to me quickly and I love it loveit love it!  Too bad the radio is now playing some of the songs to death.
This selection of songs really touches my heart and soul.  Can't stop playing it over and over again.  You will not be disappointed.
Adele keeps getting better. I wish I could sing like she does she is so amazing. 21 is an album that will be on repeat. She became successful at a young age and she sure deserves it. Her voice gives me the chills. I couldn't wait for this to come out it feels like it's been along time waiting. This album was worth the wait. Maybe this album will be in my top favorite 40 albums of the year. On some songs like Someone Like You her voice reminds me of Fiona Apple. I recommend getting the deluxe version of this album it's worth the extra cost. The live bonus songs show her amazing voice even more. Adele is a shining star. My favorite songs on this album are:1. Someone Like You2. Don't You Remember3. Take it All4. Turning Tables5. He Won't Go
My gorgeous birthday present to me I'm not sure which of these superb poetical powerful tracks is my favourite because I love them all and can't turn it off they're in my head even when they're not in the machine. Just adore 21 highly highly recommended; `Take It All' Adele must be the `One And Only'. Fabulous.
"I like ""unconventional"" voices that I can't reproduce. Character-filled is what I dub them and Adele is one of those for sure. I am so grateful that I can appreciate music because listening to this album FILLS me with JOY!!! I broke out in goosebumps on at least 4 of the cuts and the only thing I DON'T like about this album is that it makes me KICK myself for getting out of practice on piano. :-(I'm past the age where I pine away for lost loves but she writes some pretty relevant words that are timeless even if you're among those who don't enjoy wallowing in the misery of a failed relationship.I really really enjoyed this album"
I just love this mp3 CD!!  Chock block full of great songs..  Adele21 is worth the purchase. You won't be disappointed.
This sophomore effort from Adele is rich in lyrics production heart soul and voice.  The extra live tracks at the end put the cherry on top.
Terrific CD.  I think most women can relate to the lyrics of these heart-felt songs.  There is a good reason why Adele has won so many recent awards for her singing and song writing.
Although getting old fast I know a great voice when I hear one and Adele has the finest of any pop lady I've heard in years (and the album cover will be in time iconic even if it was done many times before by others). And hers is a success deserved for she also has that rare ability to be not only acrobatic vocally (ala Mariah Carey who could have used material like this!) but soulful intense and dare I say it? Creative. This album runs a gamut from minimalist ballads to tough rocking tracks that have style and verve. A major improvement on her first but uneven debut.***VINYL ALERT***Not very good at all. Seems to be a 180gram pressing but this album with its timings cried out for a 2-Lp edition with wider grooves to at least come near the elaborate depth of the original recording. This single-Lp pressing has a great cover but the vinyl was not only a bit messy (some warpage early on) but the sound very constricted. As a vinyl hound I love the idea of best selling acts like Adele and Bruno Mars having vinyl editions of their albums available but from a sonic standpoint 21 is not very good. 3 Stars because it is listenable but should have been a lot better.
I believe Adele must write her own songs as her style is one dimensional. She has a good strong voice. I did not like SKYFALL  the soundtrack for the latest Bond movie
Adele is a great singer whose style is like the soul singers of the past. The only other similar charting singer recently was Amy Winehouse. Most of the others these days have a very synthetic sound. I love that she uses simple arrangements where the voice really shines but there is sameness to all the songs that gets a bit tedious after a while.
I purchased this as a gift in plenty of time for Christmas...and thank goodness I did.  It took over a week for this product to be shipped and almost just as long for it to make it to my doorstep.  While of course it came in time for Christmas I was very disappointed to open my package to find a cracked CD case.  I am a frequent Amazon shopper and this is the first time I have had any issues but I am bummed that I have to give this as a gift.
"Why did I wait two weeks to buy this?  I knew I loved the first release off this album ""Rolling in the Deep"" but nothing could have prepared me for the rest.  I'm a die hard fan of The Cure and as such get a little irritated when someone does a cover of any of their songs.  Adele's version of ""Lovesong"" is incredibly unique and completely sets itself apart from the original version.  The samba style she used to give her personal touch to this song is fitting and makes ""Lovesong"" a wonderful song not just a cover.Adele brings us through the full love cycle again in her 21 album.  We see the joy the heartache and the renewed hope that love brings time and again.  I doubt I will ever tire of listening to each and every song on this album."
Adele's songs seems to carry a calm  yet invigorating tune that carry you right through to the very last song! There are no tracks to skip or tracks that are just ok. They all seem to flow seamlessly without flaw. This album is definitely a remarkable in that it should be up for lots of awards on the next Grammys without a doubt. I am so happy I discovered this album because it will be on repeat for awhile for me. Adele is definitely a phenomenal artist who has even greater things coming if that is even possible!
I still love her but you can tell someone's got ahold of her now and she's aiming to please the masses. Happens to the best of 'em.
I am always looking for something to listen to that is not synthesized and modernized. I came across this album in the new releases for my Zune and decided to give it a listen. I am in love with this album! The range and emotion is amazing and the song selections all sound different but are of quality. If you are looking for an album that you are not going to just listen to once then I recommend that you listen to this. My all-time favorite is Love Song (I know it's not original but I think she delivered it amazingly). I am blown away and I am about to listen to this for a second time! Purchase you will not be sorry!
"I didn't really think much of Adele's first album ""19"".  I like her voice but I didn't hear anything spectacular on that album.""21"" on the other hand...well this is an album.  And I mean that in the best possible way: it's not just a collection of songs thrown together it's a journey a story...told by a master storyteller.There really isn't a weak song on the album.  ""Rolling In The Deep"" and ""Turning Tables"" and ""Don't You Remember"" and ""I'll Be Waiting"" are all slightly more outstanding than the rest but the whole thing is very very strong.In my opinion two songs stand apart: ""Set Fire To The Rain"" and ""Someone Like You"".  Hard to say which I like more.  The energy of ""Set Fire To The Rain"" is amazing...as is the emotion of ""Someone Like You"".  If you have no interest in the whole album at least get these two songs.  No I mean right now go get them.  I'll wait.Okay got them?  Good.  Go listen to them.  And when you're done come back and get the whole album.  And when you've listened to that come back and write a review because we need to let the world know about this.  In a musical landscape where empty noise usually wins the day (Lady Gaga? Justin Bieber?) Adele's ""21"" stands as a throwback to the days when artists actually cared about the product they put out rather than simply trying to ""cash in"" on whatever the popular fad of the day happens to be."
must say she has a lovely voice wife really loves this album.A 1 buy great addition to any music library
"A lot of artists who win the Best New Artist award at the Grammys have been known to have that impressive debut followed by a significant if not catastrophic sophomore slump.  One hopes and indeed thinks that this will not be the case with British singer Adele who won the award in 2009 with her album ""19"".  Now she's out with her second album ""21"" an album that merits a ""10"" rating (or five stars as is the case here at Amazon) and which seems to ensure that the dreaded sophomore slump doesn't happen to her.With several producers being involved including Rick Rubin who was responsible for among other things the Dixie Chicks' 2006 smash TAKING THE LONG WAY hints of a wide variety of styles being essayed from straight pop-rock to gospel R&B; and country and Adele dropping hints of being influenced by disparate artists like Alison Krauss and Wanda Jackson one would think that ""21"" would be a crazy patchwork quilt.  This turns out not to be quite the case but that is not necessarily a bad thing.  It mostly stays in the blue-eyed soul/pop groove that this young Brit seems as comfortable in as Joss Stone with such songs as the gospel-tinged ""Rolling In The Deep"" the big-beat 60s sound of ""Rumor Has It"" (which occasionally smacks of Amy Winehouse's recent cult classic hit ""Rehab"" in terms of production values) and the 70s-influenced ""Lovesong.""  The closest that Adele comes to a country-influenced sound is on ""Don't You Remember"" which actually closer in spirit to the classic 1970s country-rock ballads of Linda Ronstadt than to the safe anodyne stuff of Taylor Swift and Carrie Underwood.  She also resists for the most part the tendency to over-emote that has turned me off to so many overhyped divas of the last twenty years which is a relief.Adele's greatest asset is a voice that sounds extremely mature for someone who is not quite yet 23; and just on the basis of this album and its predecessor she is only likely to get better as the years go by.  All she needs to do is to not take herself too seriously and not get swept up in the attention surrounding ""21"" and her career is liable to be a long one."
Been wanting to purchase this CD for quite a while.  Finally broke down and purchased it and was not disappointed.  great price too.
adele is amazing.  what more is there to say really?  she's young beautiful and talented.  I love this CD so much.
I'm a 57 yo female and a new fan of Adele. I bought 19 & 21 & watched the Live concert. Incredible. I agree with the other 5 star reviewers - 19 is great but 21 is fabulous. The songs on 21 really speak to me & the quality of the recording is outstanding. The songs flow one into the other - well co-ordinated.
"Adele is a singer. Wow isn't it weird to say that? In today's society so many performers have to utilize auto tune and various vocal manipulation tools to even get a record out on the market. Adele doesn't have to do that she has raw talent which is for the most part sadly missing in most of popular music today.Her voice is like one from the past. It is haunting and beautiful. She isn't over-rated simply put her voice is one of the best in music. She swept all of her categories at the grammys and ""21"" has remained at the top of the charts for over a year. All of the singles released from this album have also hit number one on the billboard chart.I haven't listened to the entire album because the very first song ""Rolling in the Deep"" is so catchy and so compelling.. it's hard to top. As are ""Fire to the Rain"" and ""Someone Like You"". I haven't been disappointed and you won't either."
Adele is really improving her style with each new Cd.  Looking forward to the next one.  The CD was in very good condition.
WONDERFULWhat can I say Adele has a marvelous voice and I enjoy the CD immensely.  I can't wait to purchase more by her.
I'm kinda picky when buying CD's since there's always only a few good songs in each album while the rest are alright. But this is one and few albums were every single song just brings u in every time! Even thow there's only 11 songs I still don't get tired of lisaning to her voice! Strongly recommend in anyone's music collection!
I've been a big fan of Adele since she released 19. It was an amazing record well deserving of the critical acclaim and awards. Keeping that in mind 21 blows it out of the water. Adele's lyrics and style have vastly improved and the production value on this album is great. It is a must buy.
I received my order promptly and I really love it. It was securely packaged and I haven't stopped playing it since. I may have to order another one soon if I wear this one out...Hahahaha.
Adele has such a full rich voice which is pleasing and enjoyable.I purchased this for my Ipod (which I haven't figured out how to use yet).
Wonderful songs from Adele.CD quality is good! I bought it from Amazon even though they have it in Singapore because of the better printing of the CD!I cant remember where is it from but should be of a better quality then Asia.
I am so happy that I purchased this CD. Her music is so good.Her songs really rell a story.I shall emjoy listening to her music over and over again.
Great music if you like Adele this is a good album. With out a doubt she has one of the best voices in the world today look forward to buying her next recording. Listen to it everyday.
CD has most of her hits on it. I play it every day on my ride to work and it gets me energized for the day.Her voice is so soulful and she has a great range.Love it love it....
She is powerful and wonderful to listen to. Definable her own sound. I LOVED her. She will be added to my music Library and in my IPOD  forever. I can not wait and am actually drooling with the thoughts of her new Album.
This album and its entirety is such a personal  very saddening album  yet these feelings and chills you get as the album progresses are all too commonly felt and.understoood. its brutal yet filled with soo many tender moments which is probably why it was the best selling albumb of 2011....I smell.a couple.graMMys in the.near future
Oh Adele you just keep getting better and better. This is a wonderful album that is as enjoyable the 100th time as the first.
We love Adele's voice and downloaded this album to our MP3 player. Some songs are better than others but if you love Adele's sound we think you will be pleased with this album.
I bought this cd only knowing the songs that have been out on the radio (which are quite a few of the ones on the cd) and ended up loving the entire disc! Definantly a must buy!
I got this CD after only listen to one song off of it. I got it and couldn't stop listening to it. Adele has amazing voice and her songs are very true to life
O.K....so I am late on the band(review)wagon here ~~~ Passing on my 2 cents anyway ~~~Wonderful music.  Great. I won't bore with all of the accolades that everyone else has already expressed.  She is great. We know this.  But one song that grinds my teeth is ~He Won't Go~.  Can't stand the Rihanna (or anyone else you can think that sings this type..there are many) style with the trivial poor lyrical expressions.....it grates on me.Otherwise love it.  Finally someone as a Christmas gift thought I should actually own her work. :)
"This is the first ""Adele"" album that I have bought. She has a beautiful voice and even my 8 yr.old granddaughter likes her music and loves to sing along. No bad words or screaming."
19 21 23 I want more the bigger the better. when a 21 years girl put fire in the rain its time to pay atention.
Adele has a great voice.  Her songs are passionate well-written and catchy.  The only negative for me is that within some of the songs they get repetitive.  Need to change it up more bridges or something else seems to be missing.
A much improved second album in choice of cuts as well as technical quality.The album is a current favorite of mine.
first learned about Adele through my kids then an appearance on Saturday Night live and I fell in love. I have followed her ever since and this CD does not let you down.One of her songs (My One and Only) is being sung at my upcoming wedding and is just the perfect fit.Soulful and innovative her music is timeless.
I'm not going to lie i liked 19 better but i think this album is an aquired taste each time i listen it i like it more. I am not a pro giving reviews but this is what i think besides i saw another review where it said the sound of the cd was not good i do not agree with that.
This album has so many great songs and the voice of adele its amazing  it's a pleasure to have her in my personal collection
Adele is the best great balance on this production if you are a fan will enjoy a lot. CD full of energie and great music
Amazing CD. Just what I expected when I purchased it though. The only complaint I should have just bought the mp3 version instead of the actual CD the booklet with the CD was just photos no lyrics.
What the devil I have to write 20 words or more about a CD that any simpleton can see is wonderful provided that same simpleton likes Adele.  It's a great CD no surprises.
Adele is one of the best singers around.  This CD is absolutely my favorite.  All the songs are great.  Not a single dud in the package.
Worth it. vinyl is wonderful. just missed the lyrics that could come at some artwork to enhance the experience of hearing their music. otherwise note 10
Rarely do I like so many songs on one album...Adele 21 is that rarity. This is a keeper! A bonus--I can even understand her lyrics! Beautiful music.
What do you get when you mix a pig with a skinned cat? The answer is Adele.I am floored by the number of people (mostly over-the-hill soccer moms trying to feel relevant) that think this is the greatest singer of all time.I've heard better singers not make it past the first round of American Idol. She can't carry a tune without her voice cracking. And don't tell me that gives her singing character. It is rubbish and that is where this CD belongs in the trash.
Liked all the songs but loved some of them which I play over and over.  Will buy more of her music.
I'll leave it to the hardcore fans to rate and review each song individually. I'll keep it short by saying this is one of the best albums i've heard in a very very long time. if you like soulful music and voices such as amy winehouse you will not be disappointed here.
No room for anything other than ABSOLUTE praise for this album.  Adele has such an amazing pure voice.  I liked her first album but this one is pure gold.  Cannot stop listening and the songs have permeated my life so that they are constantly playing in my head.  All my other albums are feeling neglected because this is the only one playing.
I was excited to hear her voice on vinyl however I was really disappointed that the Digital quality came thru killing the excitement.
I thought by now after hearing the song Rolling in the Deep all over the radio and elsewhere I'd be tired of it. Far from it especially since it leads right into what I think is the best track Rumor Has It. There's a group of slower melodic tunes that put the richness and emotion of Adele's voice front and center. Then there's at least one more good rocker besides the two I mentioned to keep the CD from being purely a showcase for Adele's voice - without rolling in the deep.
The pressing of this vinyl is very strong and heavy. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in owning a great album. This is a must for any person that enjoys vinyl.There is a download card for a free digital download. IT EXPIRES FEB. 12 2012 so make sure you use it before then!I would have enjoyed more cover pictures or booklet but otherwise I highly recommend this vinyl.
This  is a great album. I don't buy many albums so that should tell you how much I like it.
I purchased this CD for my wife.  She loves the music.  It works beautifully and has been used numerous times.
I never knew what the big deal was about Adele until I heard one of her songs. I was hooked within 2 minutes. I took a leap of faith and bought the cd just based on one song. WOW I can't stop listening to her now!!!!!
I absolutely loved 19 with the exception of first love.  Knowing that I was so excited to get 21.  I was a tad nervous because listening to the samples on amazon I wasn't totally in love but figured I liked her enough to support her.  I have been listening to it nonstop all day.  The stories she tells are phenomenal and being a young person in the 80s I was completely worried about covering The Cure's Lovesong but her version is lovely.  If you're expecting the same sound as 19 you may be slightly disappointed but if you have aged during the time from release of 19 to release of 21 I think you will really enjoy.  I loved the jazzy soulful sounds and her power.  I recommend purchasing and taking time to listen.  Turning Tables Rolling in the Deep Set Fire to the Rain among others really impressed me.
One of the best new albums I've heard in years!  I love her voice and EVERY song on it.I only hope she can keep it up and that her next effort is equally beautiful and moving.
I bought this because it was a better price than anywhere else.  I was pleased with this purchase and think Adele sings beautifully.
Fantastic cd I believe I am going to wear the cd out playing it so much. What a voice and would love to see her in concert.
"I received it before the arrival date so that brought me to tears. As i remove the vinyl out of the sleeve i realized that i could use it to destroy shang tsung. So i started playing and shang walks in the room with a ball of fire in his hand and says to me ""be prepared to die"" imagine that in a deep old man voice. We stare at each other in evil glares and then the song turning tables comes on and he immediately starts sobbing cause he was embarassed that he had no control of his raging fire hand disorder. Overall this album is very good. I would highly recommend it to the leaders of the other realm."
Adele is just awful truly horrible. Great voice but every single song sounds like all the golden hits from days past. Needs more originality.
"All I can say is ""great!""  Great music great song-writing great songs great VOICE....  So much talent and heart.  I love the whole album but my LEAST favorite tracks are ""Don't You Remember"" (it kind of has a country feel to it that I'm not terribly fond of) ""One and Only"" and ""Lovesong.""  One thing I must say is the reason I decided to purchase the album is because I found myself watching/listening to her live YouTube performances of ""Someone Like You"" over and over again.  After getting used to her live versions I immediately noticed the album version is different in two ways:  1) the tempo of the album version is much faster 2) the bridge is harmonized on the album version.  At first I was pretty upset about this but after listening to the album non-stop for the last three weeks I've gotten used to it.  However part of me wishes she would've included a live version of this song on the album.  I loved her first album (19) and in my opinion this one is ever better!  I'm a fan for life!  Can't wait for her next album!"
I enjoy her music.  I can see why she has won so many awards.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys good music.
I really don't understand the hype behind Adele there is something about her voice that makes me cringe (and not in a good way) Chasing Pavements was good but this is just bad I think they overhyped this album enough and people are just eagting in up. I'll passtry again next time Adele.
This cd is great to listen to anytime I am driving or working around the house!  It is good music so it transcends different moods that other music cannot.
haven't listened to the whole album yet (saving it for christmas) but did play the 2 big songs from it.  they sound so great.  what a voice she has.
Finally purchased this Adele CD and I am completely satisfied. I have already installed it on my car for those long trips. Eagerly awaiting for another Adele great!
I am addiced to this album. Adele is an amazing singer but she is also an amazing song writer. If you dont like this album than you must be tone deaf! I am searchig now to find out where I can see her live!
"Adele a voice that captured me from the first time I heard it.  I was so impressed and I don't impress easily by Adele that I pre-ordered her latest album 21 unheard but based on her previous songs.  ""Rolling in the Deep"" grabbed me because of its gritty blues style coupled with a voice that took me back in time. The driving beat makes you move while listening to this song and at the same time lifts you up.  This was the cover song for 21 but I am totally stuck on ""Set Fire to the Rain"" and I seriously believe that this could have been the cover song without a doubt.  I don't know how you may listen to music but I listen to the whole album and while I'm listening I choose my favorite tracks. I file away the numbers in my mind for referencing and for future listening selections. I also create a playlist of these songs and just let them play over and over again. While I am writing this review I am only listening to one tract ""Set Fire to the Rain."" I have heard this tune repetitiously for an extended period of time and I can tell you that I am so in love with Adele's voice and this song!  Her delivery is impeccable on this song and not only on this song but the rest of the album is a complete delight. And one thing I want you to know about me I just don't buy an album from any singer unless they are good. And this girl is so good!  Gavin"
I got this for my wife. She loves Adele I also really like her music to. This was a past sale I bought a while back still a great buy!
I bought this CD because I liked one of Adele's songs.  I heard another song that was good but the other songs weren't too much to my liking.  I was finding myself listening to just those two songs so I ended up trading this one in.
This one is right up there with Who's Next London Calling Exile on Main Street Every Picture Tells a Story Never mind The Bollocks OK Computer & What's the Story Morning Glory as amoung the very best British Pop/rock records ever made.
I love buying a CD where all the songs are enjoyable to hear.  This is definitely one of those albums.  Adele will be hard pressed to top this one.
"A great album from beginning to end.  The hit ""Rolling In the Deep"" starts things off and ""Rumor Has It"" keeps it going.  Adele's gorgeous voice pangs with emotion on each song songs that make you want to move & songs that make you hurt for the memories they can bring up.  This album already feels like one of my top 10 and that's after only 4 listens of just digging every song.  I hope you buy this album as a voice like this should be enjoyed by all."
The CD arrived on time and is in excellent shape no problems. Adele's voice is comparable to Barbra's and Celine's....who wouldn't love hearing her?
"... to equal much less surpass this album.Reviews are not really needed for ""Adele 21"" unless one has been living under a rock for the past year or two.  Every song is perfectly presented by Adele and her crew.  Though the radio stations where I live play mostly Track 1 (Rolling In The Deep) and Track 11 (Someone Like You) my favorites are Track 5 (Set Fire To The Rain) and Track 2 (Rumour Has It).  But then all of her songs are great.  I believe you will be very pleased with a purchase of this CD."
I Have Got The CD And Its Completely OK But The Cover Was Cracked When I Got It Otherwise Its A Great CD!
My love is in central america working for the peace corps and she can't download it or listen on her cloud player.  Why? Because she is in Central America.  But I buy this from my home in Florida.  How can I get my money back?
The CD is great!  I can't stop listening to it.  I received it within 4 days and it was in very good condition.  Thank you.
I bought this cd when I heard one of her songs and loved it. This whole cd is great. She has a wonderful voice.
Since I first heard Adele's voice she reminded me of Latina singer La India. Adele's passion can be heard in her singing! She sounds beautiful! Can't wait till I hear more
Great music and it's even more enjoyeable since there was no hassle in getting it purchased.  The process is great and easy to use.
Soulful and deep with lyrics that will make you laugh and cry.  What a beautiful journey this cd takes you on.  Highly recommend it.
Received this album on vinyl as a gift and I must say it exceeded all of my expectations.  The album itself is stellar and the vinyl print is great.  Love it.
First heard Adele on the 2011 Grammy Awards show and fell in love with &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34; so I ordered this CD.  It was a used item but it looks and plays perfectly.
This sophomore effort by Adele is great.  Her voice is in top form and the lyrics provide much insight into what she was going through and feeling at the time she wrote the songs.  Wonderful!
A little short but excellent.  She is a rare talent I bought the CD because i love her voice and her music and I wasn't disappointed.
I HAVE NEVER HEARD ANY OF HER OTHER CD'S YET BUT THIS ONE BY FAR IS SO AWESOME AND SHE HAS THE MOST AMAZING VOICE....CAN'T WAIT TO GET IT
Love the raw energy behind that voice.  Initially downloaded just a couple of songs from i tunes and before I knew it had the whole album.  Listen to it every day while walking the dog and the background beat in a lot of the songs keeps me a good pace.  Some of the lyrics and notes have almost a haunting quality.  The music sort of wraps itself around you and there's no way out:-)
I hadn't heard much of Adele until I previewed the tracks on Amazon.  What an amazing talent.  If I remember right she co-wrote most of the songs on 21.  It's been in my car's cd player for a month or so now and I'm still not tired of listening.
ADELE 21 or should I say Coming of age. Giving this disc several second take spins I came away more impressed than originally. I hear the depth sincerity and a bit more maturity in all the tracks the more I listen to ADELE 21. Some of the performances are downright haunting. It definitely grew on me.
I think this singer is incredibly talented and that there were a lot of innovations on this cd.Musically that is. I heard one song on the radio while I was driving  and I found it moved me to tears. Had to order the cd right away!
I love listening to this cd in my car.  She just belts out the songs and makes the hair on my neck stand up.  There's not a lot of singers that do that to me and when they do I can stop listening.  I recommend this cd.
i love every song it's a great listen and i would recommend to anyone that wanted to hear some good music.
First album purchase in about 30 years. The quality of sound is great. My wife is enjoying the sound as well.
Love this cd. All of Adele's music is great. This cd has a good beat and rythmn on the songs.
This CD is great for a guy looking to please his better half. I would buy it again  You don't get tired of it full of nuance.
Found Adel by accident - I know I'm oblivious to everyday stuff - but her voice is amazing!The deal on this CD was amazing also :) (shameless plug there)Adel's voice and manor in delivery - simply knock your socks off great.
Such an amazing thing to find Adele on vinyl I adore her and listen to this album almost daily. Beautiful
Listening to album at this minute!!  Love &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34; main  reason I bought this album. I do like  very much the rest of album!!  Oh! this seller delivered product in 2 days!!!
"Her voice is above all loud in the Bette Midler category. Her songs have meaning are well written but I found that after listening to all of them I asked myself if this was worth 6 Grammys? My honest answer is no. I played her album alongside Adam Lamberts ""For Your Entertainment"" Lady Gaga's "" Born this Way"" Madonna's ""Immaculate"" and the superbe ""Dive"" by Sarah Brightman. Adele will one day be in their league perhaps but not yet. Im 64 have eclectic musical tastes and know excellence when I hear it. I hope she succeed s (and Im sure she will!) but the Grammy's went overboard in a kind of mass hysteria over this. I think that these and others ought be judged stricly by sales not by judges who's motivations for selecting someone may be no better than who decides the next Miss America."
What can I say or anyone!  She is a gift.  From her firs no. 1 hit album to the latest is just wonderful!
This is an absolutely fabulous CD.  One of the best I have ever purchased.  With some CDs you only get one or two great hits this thing is packed.  Well worth the purchace price and then some.
The Adele 21 CD I ordered was received on time and in fantastic condition.  I can't get enough of Adele...what an awesome CD.
This is the best CD I've listened to in a while. Adele is extremely gifted with an incredible voice and every word comes straight from her heart. I'm surprised I haven't worn it out yet as I listen to it constantly! Looking forward to following her career as I know she will be around for a long time.
Wow Wow! This album is soooo good- I've had it since it came out and i still can't get enough of it. I own her 19 album and i liked most of it but it just cant be compared to this one. I love each and every one of the songs on this album.This is a definite must buy for anyone!
"I for the most part am a fan of classic rock and roll.  It's not often that an artist of today's times comes by and catches my ear the way Adele has.  I bought this piece for ""Rolling in the Deep""  but was pleasantly surprised to find out that this entire album was an absolute joy to listen to.  Go on Adele...make a joyful noise!"
"I was listening to adele  with my son and she started swearing like crazy.  Now all I here from little Roberto is ""What The ..."
after hearing her sing on hd.net live & on the radio sirius etc was expecting so much more from the vinyl reproduction of her music but the lp came scratched on side 2 which isn't that bad not worth the hassle sending it back to amazing amazon but considering it's brand new in shrink wrap shouldn't be huh!! that & using my dual 1218 it doesn't quite measure up to how the cd sounds & i don't have that prob with any of my other lps or comparisons so can only conclude that this vinyl isn't up to snuff!! otherwise luv her music luv the songs just not this particular version or format.21 (Vinyl)UPDATE: digital dl now works as of 3/13/12!! woohoo lol.
this CD is one of the best I ever heardthe music is so spectacular and make my heart so very happy.
Nice voice.Heavy duty vinyl and sleeve.Only two songs I like on both sides.Recording is not what I was expecting.
Normally CDs don't have so many popular songs but this one does.  The other tracks are great as well.  Awesome purchase.
Adele has a very strong and powerful voice.  Her song selections are just right for her style and vocal range!
I absolutely love this record I will never get sick of it!! My favorite songs are Rolling In The Deep Someone Like You Set Fire to the Rain Turning Tables and Rumour Has It. The passion and soul she uses is like no another. I &lt;3 Adele :)
every song is a winner there is not one I didn't like I would continue getting more of her other cd's
I like this album very much.Adele is unique and hearten voice.I listen this every day.Thank you very much.
I have heard these songs on this album and I like it very much will listen to it when ever I can
"I'll admit I was late in getting on the Adele bandwagon.  I heard ""Rolling in the Deep"" first on MTV and then on the radio and thought I need to find out more about this artist.  I really like the first half of this CD a couple of good break up songs.  I listened to 21 first then went backwards to 19."
Was very disappointed in the sound quality of the album. Adele is awesome but the vinyl is not. Album is new and looks beautiful but sounds warped on a couple songs and the edge was so uneven that the record was dragging because I have an enclosed turntable.
Rolling In The Deep Rumor Has it Turning Tables Set Fire to the Rain Someone Like you and my personal favorite I'll Be Waiting are pure magic.One and only and Lovesong(this is a song from the group the Cure-they do it better she does a striped down version dont care for.)Saying that this is a powerful cd that reminds us that the voice matters-not the pop video fluff(Lady Gaga/Kate Perry etc...)and I like those too but this is bare bones striped of all hooks and you can focus on those chops of her which are wonderful.  And just becasue you are not a size zero-you can make it ladies. Ladies if you have something to say say it and dont look back. No matter how you look you are beautiful!Looking forward to her future songs- will be watching her career-she deserves the Grammys-I will have my fingers crossed for her to win them all.
Adele was described as this decades Sarah McLachlan so I decided if she's good enough for that comparison there must be some truth. Adele's voice is pretty but the lyrics fall short. If you like Taylor Swift or any of the Top 40 on MTV trash you'll love her.
I bought this for my husband and he loves it but he did say it is also very depressing to listen to for any length of time.
Adele's music is the best music of today!  This CD is worth buying and provides such pleasant listening music you can find me in my kitchen having a glass of wine and listening to Adele!
She has a beautiful voice and the woman can sing!  This CD is great because each song is something I will listen to over and over again.
I got this for a friend in the USA who is not familiar with the entertainer. My friend is also a fan of rhythm and blues and country and found Adele to have a similar appeal. She is very happy with the CD. It was delivered promptly and I will use Amazon again.
Love music by Adele.  She writes and sings meaningful words as well as beautiful melodies.  I will buy more of her music.
This CD was received promptly and in perfect condition.  I would not hesitate to buy again.  I am new to the sounds of Adele but do like what I hear.
This brilliant 21 year old woman poors her heart in her lyrics and her soul in her song with her powerful no-nonesense approach to life and love... Her voice hits high notes low notes...and perfect in between! Great  production on this CD amazing artist all the way!!! 10 stars hands down...Buy it take Adele's journey with her...through her break up.
She has an average voice with Ok songs. What's the big deal. I would return the CD if I could.She has an annoying voice.
I love this CD and I even bought one for my mother for Mother's Day!  The CD is for any one who has ever loved!!!  It's AMAZING!
After hearing the title song every song sounded like the previous one. I saw her sing on the awards show and hopedthe CD would be more of the same. I was disappointed after hearing all the titles since it was too much of the same.
I love this CD she is a fantastic singer that will probably take every award this year. Her voice has improved a great deal since the 19 album.
"This album is in a league of it's own. While listening to it for the 1st time I noticed straight off that it was compeletly different from ""19"". I love this album! I was skeptical...well more so doubting her when she said that she would include country music but I must say I loved it! My favorite songs on the album are ""Rolling In The Deep"" ""Rumour Has It"" ""Set Fire To The Rain"" and ""One And Only"". But every song on this album is amazing! I HIGHLY recommend it!"
I have been in love with Adele for a while now and recently purchased this CD for my car. Ordered it on a Monday and got it on Wednesday even with Super Saver Shipping! I am completely satisfied with this purchase!
"If Adele does not win a Grammy (or two) next year for this album then I quit!!!  Stop giving out Grammy's to the so-called ""best"" that music has to offer.  This young lady deserves those awards for sure.  I don't buy whole albums anymore but I will for Adele.  Someone please teach our children what ""real"" music is....i.e. Adele!!!!  Great CD...best I have listened to by far in years.  I wish she would collaborate with some other singers as well.....get some duets going!!!  I think I have listened to ""Someone Like You"" from her 2011 British Awards performance on YouTube close to 30 times.....I wish the album version were like that performance!  You won't be disappointed!"
"I have never owned a CD that I so completely loved every song on it. I can't choose a favorite. I change it every day! Neither have I had a cd that I bought 3 or 4 of the same. I am afraid #1 that she will not surface again for 2 yrs or more and #2 that I will wear one out and not be able to purchase another because they are sold out! I hope she returns to us fans that bought these cd's....and bless us once again with that pure perfect voice!I am and have been nothing but Southern Gospel music fan for years but I am sold on Adele 100%. I have double of everything she has out. I just downloaded her duet with Darious Rucker of the Lady Antebellum song ""Need You Now"". Awesome..she held notes long after his voice stopped. Hurry back Adele ""We Need YOU Now""."
We love Adele and listen to her albums a lot.  She is fantastic and super talented.  All the tracks are great.
I rarely sit still these days but when I played this disc for the first time I found myself totally engrossed in the moment. Adele's voice was full of heart and emotion without sounding fake the music reminded me of some of the 60's music my mom used to play. So many singers seem to mumble so it was nice to hear the lyrics clearly for a change. I wish her lots of success with this one; already looking forward to her next release.
I love this cd it has alot of Adele greatest hits. All sthe songs sounded very good.She has such a powerful voice.I will buy more of her cds
"My biggest problem with the album is the fact that Adele's contralto jazz voice is being used in such a manner that I cannot distinguish each song from the other.All Adele is and I don't care what YOU think (Ohhhoho! I really don't!) is an over-produced wannabe-mainstream popper. She should be using her soully jazzy voice to make good music not stuff on the same record shelf as Lady Gaga.Rolling in the Deep has to be the most annoying song I have heard in my LIFE. Rumour Has It is God-awful song that deserves to be shot and those are the only two songs I can tell apart. The rest of the tracks have only slight differences that I even though I can tell apart each Sharon Van Etten song (look her up! Amazing folk music!) cannot detect the subtle differences.Adele is trying too hard on this album. Her voice is somewhere between an Amy Winehouse except not as rough and not nearly as amazing and a Lady Gaga except every song is about her ex.How can Adele cite Alanis Morisette as an influence on this album cause this album sucks?You want good music? Amy Winehouse Norah Jones A Fine Frenzy Regina Spektor Fiona Apple... heck! I would even choose The Dixie Chicks over Adele!Leave North America and don't come back until I see a solid jazz album in the vein of Frank Tidal Come Away With Me and 11:11!JOY! REPLIES!-------------I did say I liked her voice right? Just that it isn't being used in the right way. If Diana Krall tried to sing along with a song by Nirvana she would crash and burn right? Just like since Adele is trying to sing something that sounds like it was written by a depressed Avril Lavinge accept maybe a grade ahead (A grade ahead of Avril Lavinge is still an elementary grade mind you) when she has this unique jazzy voice she could put to good use on a jazz record! I don't have anything constructive to say about the record itself cause there is nothing constructive to say.Now as far as how I got on here and said what I thought of this record (which I did not say ""sucked"" by the way. Commenter made that part up...) why can't I? All the five star reviewers over-glorify Adele like she's something new and unique (Example... Ohmigosh I'm a 12 year old girl and Adeles music is like so inspring n i can apply it to this relationship i had with this boy... U suld rlly buy this cd!)... The whole ""Amy Winehosue Sound-Alike"" thing has been beat to death. If she does sounds just like like Amy (no she doesn't really) then what makes her so unique?People who are unique? People who do their own thing? People worth listening to?Cat PowerRegina SpektorFiona AppleAmy WinehouseTegan and SaraSiaMarina and the DiamondsWhoohoo! Now I know you're just going to add these artists to the ""Artist's I Hate"" List just cause I recommended them and actually have taste in music beyond pop and coughAdelecough.Farewell children!"
it came on time and I love adele the music is awesome. what a wonderful cd. I listen to it in the car all the time.......
My Granddaughter and I were on a trip and I let her listen to her music. When I heard Adele I like her music so much I bought the CD.
I think this is a good CD for Adele fans.  It showcases her songs and music with a few of her hits that I love and also some songs  I like from seeing her on PBS.  All in all a very good CD
I loved this album.  It's soulful and fun to listen to.  &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34; stands out as my favorite track.
"Awful cover of The Cure's ""Lovesong"". Shame on you. >&lt; We all know that The Cure's ""Lovesong"" is a great song but I wish that people would stop covering it. It is best AS IS."
Adele has taken this album to a new height n the Grammy has commercialized it to an extent u here the song rattling in places unimaginable! but this is to be listened with more peace n quite and beleive when the hype dies down n you start hearing less will be a LP one will pick often n play.Great quality pressing on the LP and received it very well packaged all the way in Asia delivered without a problem and onetime. Thanks Amazon.
I never even knew Adele existed until I watched the Grammy's. When she performed Rolling in the Deep she blew me away! What a unique voice. I immediately bought her CD and love it.
I Really like her voice and all songs on this album. I bought the skyfall soundtrack a while back but didnt know her name. I enjoy listening to her anytime of the day.
Adele is very powerful singer looking forward to hearing more.From her in the future you go girl setting fire to the rain!Means you are hot!!!!
This album has something for everyone: romance heartbreak soul piano solos etc.  This is an amazing CD that has won so many awards and deservingly so.  Buy it; you won't regret it!  The music will speak to you and each individual song is amazing.  21 is the BOMB!
Good cd but pricy to just get a couple tunes you want butthat's the way all music is unless you download them one at a time !
I love Adele's voice and sound! EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL is how I describe! She really has a distinct sound! I don't think there's anyone out there that compares to her. I'm finding British music again! Not since the whole British invasion of the 60s & 70s have I enjoyed something out of the UK! I really liked 19 but 21 is ABSOLUTELY REFINED! It's one of those rare cds where every song is good! I love Rumour has it reminds me of the old 60's dance music! Rolling in the deep & don't you remember are my favs! I look forward to decades of Adele music!
Excellent CD...I was only familiar with 2 of the songs on this CD prior to purchasing it and surprisingly I like most all of them.  She is an incredible artist.
The CD came fast and it great condition.  I have had it for probably a month now and it's still all I listen to.  I'm addicted!
She is a superstar and her voice is so soothing.  i have worn it out already and play it often.
I love this album...It is all I have listened to since the day it was released...Adele is amazing her voice is beautiful and this album is just truly genious...All of the songs are so easy to listen too...It has been a very long time since there has been an album out that is just clean good true music...I believe she wrote all or most of her songs which makes me appreciate her music that much more...I sure hope she wins a Grammy for this album she certainly deserves it...
I bought it for my spouse and he is really pleased with it all four of my Grandchildren love it too!
Dispatched fast and I love it already. A few tracks are filler but you expect that on any album to be honest. Overall it's definitely worth buying.
I was disappointed in this CD. Many of the songs sound alike and there are only 2-3 that I really liked. Even those though were undermined by the poor sound quality of the recordings. The richness of Adele's voice seemed missing and I had to keep adjusting the volume from song to song in order to hear.
"At first I felt that many of the songs were fillers when compared to the more famous Adele hits.  But as I listened to the entire CD three times over while waxing my truck during this year's unusual warm March I grew to appreciate most of the songs.  I now enjoy ""21"" and recommend it as a good value and pleasurable listening.  Give it a chance!"
What can you say about Adele? Here voice is second to none. Her beauty is unbelievable. Her music will get you to thinking about things that have happened to you in your life. You must get this cd.
I don't know how anyone could not like Adele but I love her.  I love how her music is different then all of todays junk.  Highly recommend and I recommend Adele19 album too!
Good album as everyone knows by now.  For some reason I never did get around to buying it probably because of the constant airplay on the radio and XM.  But I finally broke down and ordered the CD which was cheaper than buying the MP3 album yet included it for free.  Funny huh?Listened to it completely through 2 times in a traffic jam.  Still like it!
This is the only pop album I have bought in years ad it was worth it.  Adele sings very beautifully and without her charming cockney accent that she shows in interviews.
I love the title song Rolling in the deep would have liked to know that the rest of the cd had so much gospel in it. Not a real big fan of gospel so I was disappointed. Had I Known this I may have had second thoughts on buying this entire cd.
I bought this Vinyl along with a record player as X'mas gift for my GF. She loves it (so does our cat)! I love the &#34;21&#34; shown on the green background in the center area looks decent.The sound quality just blows my mind. Definitely a classic experience. Adele just rocks. Her songs need no further introducation.
now the recording mater quality is HORRIBLE.I can't believe the recording quality is so terrible. not only the sound balance/mix is off but the recording quality is sub par. if a singer of this category stands in front of the microphone hire someone who knows what needs to be done.... what a waste...
love her voice.  don't listen to the radio so she's not overplayed for me.  well worth the money you spend
This is one of the best CDs ever. I have listened to it over and over again. Its a must have for your collection.
Love this artist.  Too bad she had to cancel her tour to rest her voice.  Imagine her fans are extremely disappointed.
Adele is by far one of the best vocalists out there. Her saultry voice and pop talent leaves to wanting to listen more!
Her music only gets better!  It has been so much fun listening to Adele mature through her music.  The songs on 21 showcase her amazing voice through beautiful deep prose and an awesome new musical style.  Adele continues to impress her fans while remaining true to herself.  I truly enjoy this album and look forward to listening to it on repeat!
This CD is very nice; every song is unique and it doesn't get old. I bought it for my husband and he was pleasantly surprised. I listened to it during a long trip and it was great company. My husband listens to it on his way to work. I definitely suggest it.
"When Adele's ""21"" was first released I was a bit confused about the hype surrounding it. I had no idea who the singer was or why this album was such a big deal. However in the last year I've gotten it - here is a young woman who is a force to be reckoned with and this album proves it.Adele's voice is remnant of a time gone by of a style of singing that unfortunately has slipped away from mainstream radio. She not only displays blues vocals but has created masterpieces in songwriting. These tunes are brilliant in not only how they are written but also how they are put together. There's a delicacy and authenticity to the recording of them that is a rare gem in the world of mass-produced music we hear so much of today.'Rolling in the  Deep' the record's first single is a true blues number about loss as are 'Rumour Has It' 'He Won't Go' and 'Take It All'. Other songs like 'Don't You Remember' 'I'll Be Waiting' and 'Lovesong' (the only cover song on the record) have more of a jazz vibe. And then there are the ballads - brilliant songs like 'Turning Tables' mega-hit 'Someone Like You' and 'One and Only'. The only song that could be classified as remotely like pop is current single 'Set Fire to the Rain' but even then there is a distinctness in emotion here that differs from anything else out there.Initially I wasn't sure an album with so much hype could possibly live up to its expectations. But this one has done that and more. Adele is a rare gift in the music world today carving out a niche for herself in an industry that often seems to be homogenizing. She's certainly made me sit up and take notice and I can't wait to go back and explore her debut record."
Adele has a beautiful voice and her music is so heartfelt that I feel that her type of music is what was missing in the music industry. I look forward to Adele's next CD. Simply lovely!
Adele's a great soul singer with a little bit of country courtesy of heroines like Wanda Jackson. If the CD is less expensive than downloads I'll buy it with my free prime shipping and rip it but it would make a lot more sense if things were the other way round.
Every song is fantastic.  There are a couple she should release as singles (the one having to do with Love).  Highly recommend this CD.
Adele's voice is unsurpassed and one doesn't have to have a broken heart to enjoy her magnificent songs. Anxious for her next album.
Every so often one finds a singer and songwriter who sounds as though they have stolen all the things you have ever wanted to say to someone and managed to put all those feeling into songs.  This is what ADELE 21 did for me.
this young lady is great and hope to buy many more cd's from this artists.
Very powerful stuff. If you're tired of autotune and want to listen to someone with actual talent you might want to try this.
This cd is amazing and Adele does have an amazing voice with powerful lyrics song after song.  I just didn't enjoy track three Turning Tables and track six He won't go.  Rest of the cd is just great song after great song with her beautiful voice.  So if your into mixture of songs with pop blues so forth then pick up her music cd and enjoy the cd track after track.
I saw Adele sing on the Jimmy Kimmel Live show and was really impressed! I never really heard of her before but really loved the sound of her voice and felt it was really different than most young women singers out there. I recommend purchasing this CD if you are tired of listening to the same sort of music you hear from other young women singers.
One of my favorite albums. I have the album on CD as well and the sound on vinyl is so much better.
Adele speaks to me with her soulful and powerful voice.  Absolutely love her music.  I will be watching for new albums from her.  I pray she keeps her style and focus she is a breath of fresh air.
If you are thinking about buying the CD Just Do It!!! I would have paid the full price just for the first track Rolling In The Deep. This is a great CD!!
"Adele is an incredible artist with a voice that resonates with passion love and insight.  Her songs especially ""rising From the Deep"" and ""Rumour Has It""  have pulsing inectious beats and a wonderful sound.  Listen to the whole alum once to appreciate her range and then listen ot it again and listen to the words.  This album is one of the best of the last ten years.  This young woman puts to shame any American Idol winner of the past - Carrie Underwood comes close."
Beautiful voice! I don't agree with having certain songs only available in certain countries only. It's too random and unfair. However I'm appreciative that I was bake to get this import.
Think Carole King crossed with Janis Joplin and you've got a handle on Adele's vocals. A truly beautiful voice that is leveraged perfectly with the songs on this album. Rolling in the Deep is one of those rare songs that I loved the first time I heard it and Set Fire to the Rain isn't far behind. If you like good lyrics sung by a beautiful smoky voice you'll love this album.
I really do like her voice and her music. I would like to hear some thing more positive along the same sound
This album is brilliant! Adele's album on vinyl has a great black and white insert in the record album case and that just adds to the overall brilliance of this album. The songs are all great and having this on vinyl is really something special!
"This album is utterly beautiful and sad. It starts off strong with ""Rolling in the Deep"" then delves into the sassy ""Rumour Has It"". From then on there's no stopping Adele. With the help of Rick Rubin Ryan Tedder (from OneRepublic) and Dan Wilson Adele has created songs that allow her to shine vocally and express herself emotionally in a universal way. There is no denying Adele has a voice so perfect and stunning but it's her ability to put her pain joy and memories in a song and paint pictures with her lyrics that make her one of the best artists of the past decade. Standouts are definitely the bluesy ""One and Only"" and the gut-wrenching ""Someone Like You"". Every song on the album is special but Adele stumbles a bit with her cover of ""Lovesong"" by the Cure which to me seemed boring and too long as well as ""I'll Be Waiting"" which doesn't suit Adele as well as it could have. I would not be surprised if this album and its components were the highlight of next year's Grammy Awards. Then again thinking back to what the Grammys have become I might be surprised. Nevertheless this is an album for anybody who knows what love is. Or at least wants to remember.**Check out bonus tracks such as ""I Found a Boy"" and ""Hiding my Heart"" a cover of Brandi Carlile. Both would have fit perfectly into the standard album and ""Hiding my Heart"" which should have definitely replaced ""Lovesong"" as the cover song on the album."
If you're an Adele fan then this is the album to buy - every track hits with stunning exploration of human emotion honest lyricism and haunting themes of love's capability. Vocal range and precise yet formless delivery make this album one of Adele's best.
I love this CDit is made in the raw and when listening to it you can tell it has not been messed with at all. When Adele opens that soulful instrutmentthe most beautiful stars of all colors come out to one's delight. I thought her first Cd(Adele 19)was just awesomebut as she has said in many interviewsthat her music has changed in a way that only reflects her maturity.Adele is real and very much down to earth and she just lets the song take control as it is meant to come out! I find myselfjust as I did when Adele 19 came outlistening to it over and over and loving it ever more!
After hearing Adele on TV and the radio I wanted her cd but the songs were not to my liking other the just 1
I bought this album for my girlfriend and she loves it.  To me it's more of a chick album though
Adele.  Lyrics of rage and sadness and love and loss.  She is always superb.  This is just another album that proves how wonderful she is.
Can't stop listening to this CD.  Love every stong on it.  Her songs are so meaningful and have a way of relaxing me.
I only knew of one of her songs and i wanted to see what else she did. The whole cd was great.
Well done yet overrated.  Rolling in the Deep is a certified hit.  Too bad a majority of the album doesn't hold up as well.
This is my first album of Adele's music and I love all the songs on this album.  She reminds me of Peggy Lee's jazzy singing style!I was disappointed that the album cover arrived crushed but the CD was not damaged at arrival.
As always Adele has a unique and wonderful voice that is wonderful to listen to.  All the songs are just wonderful.
This is the first album I've owned of Adele's and I love the whole thing.  Her voice is as smooth as silk and I'm definitely going to buy more of her albums.
What more can I say....Loved Loved Loved this album.Will buy more of her music. Would highly recommend it to anyone.
That is all this CD is good for the three songs you hear on the radio non stop! I thought she would have more but nope there is a reason why they don't play them ugh!
Who doesn't like Adele these days?  What a voice!  In case you didn't know she's hysterically funny too!  Catch her interview on Graham Norton (BBC America) she's a riot!!
Adele sounds great on the CD. Best of her hits. Enjoying the bonus track as well!  Worth every penny spent on this.
Thanks for everything the product is great and came on time.I will do business with you again than you so much.
She has a beautiful voice  I had to listen to  it a few times before it grew on me. The first time i didn't like outside of the two most popular. But by the third time my daughter played it i was singing along with it.  i really like it now.
I am a music buff and this is one of the best CD I've ever heard. I absolutely recommend getting it.
Gotta love a woman with curves who doesn't get naked to sell CDs.  Love the whole CD - sexy blusie.
I loved all the songs on this CD.  We need more singers with voices as good as hers is. thanks
I ordered this CD as a Christmas present for myself this year and really liked it.  I love all the songs on it.  Wow!  Adele has a wonderful voice!
Her songs speak to the soul.  I never tire of listening to her voice.  She has such style and dimension.
Adele is a talented singer and this CD speaks for itself. Like all CD's it has hit songs that we have all heard but it also has those we have not heard.
The CD is great.  Songs/lyrics and of course the voice are all spectacular!!  Her voice reminds of old time blues. Highly recommend it to all.
My son has her CD and I listened to it when visiting and loved her voice.  I only like 3 to 4 songs on it but everytime I listen to it I do like it better.
Adele's crystal clear voice and lyrics shine on in this more recent CD. I will always recommend any of her CD's. A triumph!
I adore this album.  Great songs from a terrific singer.  Every song touches your heart. A must buy for Adele fans.
I bought this CD for my brother because he wants to give to a person as a gift. Sadly I can't open because it's not mine :(
"This is a great selection of songs performed by a woman with a lovely expressive voice. My musical tastes are generally about as far away from women singing ballads as you can get but after hearing her sing for the first time I wanted to hear more.I'm happy I bought the (what do you call it now that it is not a record or CD) ""album"" through Amazon digital and I will definitely keep Adele on my radar."
My daughter's present was what she wanted and had the musics she said she needed.  The item came as scheduled and was being used immediately
This is an instant classic.  I can't even begin to describe the power in this album.  I never write a review for anything and this makes me want to jump up for joy.  So much emotion conveyed by/through her voice.  This crosses all boundaries and should be in the collection of any music fan.  Amazing to see an artist get better with their second release as well.  Rare in this day and age and hopefully a sign of what is to come.
What can you say about this album that a truckload of Grammys hasn't already said?  This is one of the best albums of the past year maybe of the past two years.  In a world with so many artists hoping to see one or two hits from their albums Adele has crafted an album full of potential hits.  Every track on this album -- even the deepest cuts -- has the potential to be a number one.  I'm not an Adele fanboy by any means but this album is phenomenal.
She's just amazing - her songs are haunting and catchy at the same time.  At 21 one w/ this much heartache ... what will her songs be like when she realizes not every relationship is THE ONE ... I for one am looking forward to those songs too.
With this Adele's second album it is easy to listen to and see why she got the 6 Grammy's and I am sure that she will get more in the future. She  is a great singer and artist.
She have a really nice voice  a complete new style.  We cannot compare adelle with other artist because she have an original style completely different and with beautiful messages. Music that you can dance but at the same time you can think about and reflect. I really love it!!!!!!!!!!
"The numbers don't lie. This is an excellent album that has spent ages at the top of the charts. The songs are great Adele's performance is great but the quality of the recording is just mediocre and disappointing.On these types of albums where the singer's voice is such a focal point I really expect the engineer to do a better job of capturing the gift the artist is sharing with us and that didn't happen here. The dynamic range is squashed the texture is smoothed-over and even the backing tracks seem ""blurry"". Maybe I had my hopes up too high for this one."
Great Singer. Love hearing her on the radio and concerts.She sings from the heart. She touches your soul.Love you AdeleJeri
This is a complete project that I can play all the way thru - no skipping tracks on this one! Not at all like most other new projects today!Adele's voice is full of soul and emotion! Her song delivery is amazing!Definitely a new favorite project!
"I purchased this album after hearing ""Rolling in the Deep"" a few times.  This is not my typical listening music as I am more mainstream. When I listened to the album all the way through I was a little disappointed.  I kept going back to it though.  Now I appreciate each song on the album.  There was nothing wrong with the music the first time around I needed to grow a little bit to appreciate it.  I am really glad that I did. This is an amazing album."
"I first listened to Adele back in 2008 I fell in love with her song ""Chasing Pavements.""  She was little known at the time but I loved every song on the record.  Then in early 2011 she exploded even further with the foot stomper ""Rolling In The Deep"" with the awesome video to accompany it.  I was just blown away -- Adele was a no-nonsense person and her fan base grew tenfold.  And I can see why -- her sophomore record 21 is THAT good.  Beautifully crafted from start to finish Adele took on different genres with each song.  Another foot stomper ""Rumour Has It"" was a gale-force wind.  Her next hit ""Set Fire To The Rain"" was even better sounding live (from the Royal Albert Hall record).  The next few tracks ""He Won't Go"" and ""I'll Be Waiting"" are smart reggae.  With ""Turning Tables"" ""Take It All"" and ""One And Only"" Adele used some incredible lung power and knew how to deliver the goods so to speak.  Next Adele did a far superior cover of the Cure's ""Lovesong.""  It's just way better than the 1989 original.  Finally on ""Someone Like You"" you can hear Adele's voice emotionally (but brilliantly) break on the final chorus of the song.  She felt full of heartache but she made it into her own.Adele is one of those rare artists who can never do any wrong.  Although it could be difficult to have a follow-up as successful as this one I sure can't wait to find out how she does it!  Go Adele you truly ROCK!!!"
"i heard rolling on the deep and ran to purchase this cd. i honestly can not stop listing to it. ""someone like you "" is the real gem here. ""rumor has it"" sounds like an annie lennox song.  ""turning tables"" sounds very similar to ""chasing pavement"".i intend to give this as a gift to everyone for the next year. now that i have fallen in love with Adele.. all her concerts are sold out.."
She will be another consistant talent not a one album flash.Her heart is in her music. I can truly relax and feel her emotions when she sings and it ia calming for me.
i love it i play it all the time Adel is a very  good singer and you know she love sing
We lost this CD and could not go without it. Adele's voice is one that you can listen to over and over again. She is absolutely talented. You can hear her life in her voice. Love her
Like the title states start to finish great album.  Every song on this album is great.  She can sang as well as any soulful singer.  I love her voice.
I hope her success continues love her voice liked most of the songs too. She could be one of those long lasting artists.
Adele reaches into your soul. This is the first artist that has touched me this deeply. I feel every song reaching deep into my soul. Some songs bring me to tears. I recently went through a divorce and Adel speaks my heart in so many songs. Then add her beautiful voice and the power behind it as she is pouring out the pain and you have a hit.I sing and run Karaoke and also purchased her Karaoke C.D. I can't sing it like Adel but I can say that I always get requests. I can pour my heart into this because I feel the lyrics.You can't go wrong with Adel 21.Thank you Adel for this wonderful gift of sharing your heart with us.
I was very pleased with my purchase of Adele's long playing album. I really like the sound of vinyl. I think the sound is soooo much better than cd's or mp3.
It is a great album! Her best by far every song tells a familiar story. Her voice is amazing. Beautiful lyrics and great productions on every title.
This is one of those CD's that you can rock over and over. Adele has been blessed with a soulful voice. Love you Adele.
Everytime that I listen to this I become relaxed and serene.  I only learned about Adele last year from my kids.
Love Adele...that's all I have to say.
Love her music and lyrics again what is there more to say except to recommend it to family friends and co-worker.
My friend had me listen to Adele and watch her video she is very talented and has a strong beautiful voice.  Not every song on this CD is great but most of them are.  Definately a good purchase.  My husband just bought Adele 19 and we will see how she was at 19.
Even though I am an old lady I really enjoy this cd and play it often. She has a wonderful voice!
Such a powerful dynamic voice for one body to hold. She is an incredibly talented artist worth listening to more than once.
Simply put I love Adele's music. Her voice is so pure and soulful. This is on my Kindle Fire and I listen to it quite often.
i went through amazon because they have a link with my radio station and they give back some percentage when you order through the link. i wanted the cd and i thought this was a great chance to help the station and get a great cd.
Adele's 2 is better than the last one. She tells you her story and her pain is very real. This is the one Cd everyone should have. Her voice is remarkable and a gift. Truly she has a gift.
This CD is excellent. The music quality is typically top-notch Adele. I am very satisfied with this purchase. Thanks much.
The title states it all.  She is amazing.  I can listen to this disc beginning to endand every track is pure gold.  I am a firm believer that she has set the bar higher thananyone has.  I have no doubt that she will be an icon the world over.  I hope you enjoyher offering as much as I do.
I heard this CD in its entirety when visiting family last spring. Loved it then and decided to buy it to add to my collection.
I love Adele I think all of the songs on this CD are worth listening to and this CD is a great buy!
This album is AMAZING from top to bottom!! If you are going through a break-up especially you NEED this album... But it's beautiful no matter what.
Excellent CD! Adele is amazing and has such an amazing voice and unique sound! I would recommend this CD to all my friends!
Adele has an amazing voice. Nothing like anything else out there. She's in a class all by herself. I love jazz/blue has young viberant energy. Looking forward to furture recordings.
Best way to relax from a long day..listening to Adele 21 on the way home! Her voice is breathe taking!
Her first CD was great but this was even better!  It's one of my favorite albums to work out or in the car.  Definitely a frequent listen.
I have the CD which comes with free mp3. I haven't even opened the CD yet. What a great deal. If I had to pick only one album for the past five years this would be the one:-)
she is the bestshe is soulful and the lyrics are well doneI have really enjoyed listening to her!
What is there not to love about Adele's music...LOVE LOVE LOVE it! I play it all the time and the whole family is enjoying it. I think this will be one of those historically great works of music.
The CD was excellant and Adele is easy on the ear. Being in my 60's I feel this is a great compliment to her. I can actually understand the CD and relate to it.
This is so soulful and gutsy sometimes even a little raw. Adele has such a big voice that never seems to reach its limits but the emotion of the music says she trying. I have had to take it out of the car as I was listening to not much else and I'm not normally like that. There's a reason Adele has done the best Bond song in years and this album shows it not a fluke.
So far this album is enjoyable.  I often buy albums but only end up liking a few songs.  Most of the songs on this album stay true to Adele's form and therefore are enjoyable.  I really enjoy loveson which is a remake of a classic.
I had never heard of Adele until I saw her on &#34;60 Minutes&#34; and decided to buy her CD.  She has such talent and feeling in her voice that I predict she'll be a perennial favorite.  I'm 70 - I like her almost as much as my old Rock 'n Roll records!
I love this CD even more than I expected to. Adele is an outstanding talent and I look forward to more from her.
Adele's voice automatically soothes me I never skip a song. Shes such an incredible talent you will not regret buying her CD.
Apparently according to my kids at least I'm way behind the curve having only recently discovered this album (see I even still call it an &#34;album&#34;!)  I enjoy it from the perspective of a female singer and often take advantage of the times I'm alone in my office to sing along at full voice.
This has a few songs that I love but the rest I don't care for. Not worth buying and in the future I don't plan on buying much music as it is extremely over priced.
Adele has such an amazing voice.  It carries so much emotion and you can just feel her heartbreak when you listen to the album.  So so good.
i bought this CD for my sister as a birthday present because she really likes Adele and as soon as she opened it she screamed with excitement because that was the one thing she wanted. she went and got her stereo and played it and there was no problems with it at all no scratches or skips. So overall this is a great thing to buy for someone that is into all the new music like me too:)
Not that bad at all. Are you sure Etta James hasn't died and come back as a 21  year old.Get well Etta.
Oh I wanted so much to love this album as I enjoyed seeing Adele on recent late-night TV and on the delightful NPR interview last week -- I'm always up for a well-sung soul session and here is a young singer who professes her admiration for Etta James and her desire to stay true to her artistic vision rather than cater to the whims of pop music. Adele seems to have it all together but apparently this self-sufficiency and taste does not extend to her selection of a producer.The songs themselves are fine lyrically falling somewhere between Taylor Swift and the early Alanis in terms of what a heartbroken 21-year old can express in song.  The arrangements range from retro-soul to bouncy dance tracks but the musical settings often don't have much resonance with the lyrics.The real problem here is the sound specifically the sound of Adele's voice.  In live performance you can tell she has an expressive nuanced instrument but you'd never tell from hearing this.  The vocal tracks on 21 are over-processed compressed and somehow distorted stripped of emotion.  The result is not quite as soulless as your generic auto-tuned pop song but by the end of each tune your ears hurt and the instrumental breaks for the next tune come as blessed relief.  After a few tracks the album becomes hard to listen to. This is not the experience a vocal record should be.
I received 21 as a gift.  I loved every song on it.  I love to sing the background with Rolling in the Deep.  On the 2012 Grammy's they had 4 lovely ladies doing the background.  I can't stop singing along with Someone Like You.  An album passes the classic test when the unknown songs are great.  And I'm a senior citizen.
"This isn't even my preferred genre of music but Adele will blow your face right off. I thought Rolling in the Deep was pretty amazing before I bought the album but there are a number of tracks that rival it. There is a substance here you won't get with a lot of modern ""music"". I need to listen a few more times to see how it sticks with me but so far it's a competitor for one of my top ten of all time. Highly recommended."
One word...Adele....  I  love this CD.  The beat to alot of the songs is great for my eliptical workout and I don't realize I've been on it that long!
I bought this CD because I heard Rolling In THe Deep and it was such a haunting song. Really loved it. The rest of the CD is ok. I've only listened to it once so far and sometimes it takes me a few times to really get into the music especially if I'm unfamiliar with the artist.
"I love this album sooooo much! Adele's voice is insanely good!!! My faves are ""Set Fire To the Rain"" and ""Someone Like You"". You can't go wrong with this album."
An outstanding vocalist and song writer!  And all at the early age of 22 with a Cockney accent that you can't detect in her singing voice
Like this CD but not as much as my girl friend likes it. Bought it for her and she loves it but seriously does this artist have any happy songs?
I don't understand all the hype about this artist.  My wife bought this CD and I listened with an open mind because of all the attention Adele was getting on NPR and other media outlets.  Song after song failed to impress me however.  I finally concluded that she was not a particularly good or skilled vocalist.  She is very good at yelling though perhaps even in an artistic manner.  She is not Ella Fitzgerald or even Bonnie Raitt.  If you really want to hear songs sung well try one of them.  Or Etta James.  Or Linda Rondstadt.  Or Rickie Lee Jones.  Or Nora Jones.  Or... well you get the idea.  There's talent out there.  Don't settle for hollerin'.
"Rolling in the deep is the most request play from my 6-yr in the car. ""Please play it again...please play it again""Love the entire album."
Adele has a big voice and  great range.  The variety of back-up instrumentation changes the mood and tempo.  The whole CD is captivating to listen to.  Adele 19 is a great CD and Adele 21 is even better
Every once in awhile a CD comes along that reminds of the beauty of the human spirit the innocence emotion and frailty that we all have and the admission of our inner vulnerability. These songs bring tears to my eyes. They chronicle the emotions of relationships and how we give ourselves to another and we expect the same in return. We love and in return we expect love. Adele has done what many attempt to do but so many fail she has written a CD about the evolution of love and the decline of relationships. This CD is absolutely amazing from start to finish. Thank you Adele for helping me during a very emotional time in my life as you has helped me see that this inner vulnerability is actually a thing of beauty. You are truly an amazing artist and destined to be around for a very very long time. I cannot wait to see you in Philadelphia.
i enjoy this album but 19 was so so fantastic i have to admit i was less impressed.  that being said it is one album i am glad i own and hopefully it will continue to grow on me.
awesome!!! amazon is great to do business with.  i love this album.i will keep buying adele's music. i hope her health problems get better soon so she can make another album.
Love this album and have a hard time keeping it as family likes it so much too.  Great artist and music--as must for Adele fans.
I ordered this album on one day and received it the next day. Packaging was very good. The quality of the recordings were 1st rate.On Adele what can I say that hasn't been said already. She is what most female artists of R&B; strive to be.I never tire of listening to her.  This album has the best tunes she has recorded in my opinion.Highly recommended..
"I brought the album because I heard and liked one song I heard on the radio ""ROLLING IN THE DEEP"" When I got the album and played it I found a whole album I love playing from start to finish. Adele's voice and the passion she sings with has me hooked as a fan of this very talented singer"
Excellent excellent excellent. Talk about ear bugs this album is full of them. Oh did I mention excellent? The voice is the thing.
I am obsessed with this CD. Every song on this album speaks to me. Great for riding in the car and singing or sitting at home on the porch on a beautiful sunny day. Can't go wrong with this.
Liked the Cd the case was cracked but arrived prior to the date promised. The CD was in good shape and enjoy the music
This album contains all her hit songs PLUS many other beautiful songs. I'm very glad I got this lovely CD.
"It is hard for me to believe that so many people rate this performer far too high.  Adele's style is a poor merging of Country R&B; Pop and Noise.  Unfortunately she only fully succeeds in Noise.  She has a LOUD voice that on occasion drops the note and goes off key.  But with the airways filled with Rap/Crap Slop/Pop Bubble Gum Rock Rhythm with no Blues and just Punk/junk the listening ""world"" is so starved for really good entertainers that they are willing to accept what ever they can get.For those of us who remember the truly great performers Adele is really average.  There is a redundancy in her songs.  Many of them sound the same.  Her vocal range is like that of a child.  And although it can go from hushed to horrible she does not always carry the music through the changes.  Perhaps the reason she needed surgery on her vocal cords is because she is trying very hard to sing in octaves that she physically can not handle.I do not write this to cast dispersions on those who enjoy Adele's music; I say ""good for you"".  I write this for those of us who have a much greater appreciation of truly great singers and those who know that noise does not equal music.Adele's singing is maybe ""not really bad"" but truthfully Adele's singing is definitely NOT THAT GOOD."
Great new artist and a start of her work. Hope to hear more in the future albums of this star.
I listened to this CD this morning on the way into work.  I can listen to it over and over and not get sick of it!
this is my first cd by Adele. At first i wasn't sure I was going to like the entire albumbut after a few weeks of playing it every time I was in the car I really like it.This is a whole different gendrefor me so it took some getting use to. I'm a ountry music fan.
I already loved Adele before I purchased this CD and now I can listen to it anytime I want to. She is truly a fabulous singer with a lot of heart and soul in her music and voice. Recommend to everyone.
This is a classic Adele is very hot and awesome and how could it possibly get any better than this? I'm sure she'll show us . . .
I love her voice and style.  Can't wait until she releases another album one that I hope will include her single for Skyfall.
I love love love this CD! I think any of us who have had our heart broke loves this or would love it! Power voice and GREAT songs!
This music makes you want to dance! Love it! Adele's voice is so big and strong. It's the CD I have in my car right now and I don't think I'll be taking it out soon...
Few artists could match this album which is release 2 years after her first album.  I love every song which is rare these days.  She has a sultry heart-broken voice and she really makes you feel the pain and joy of being in love.  To be '21' and be able to express those emotions in the songs the way Adele does is amazing.  I can't wait til the next album.Enamored!!!!Chris Robinson
Adele has stayed #1 on the charts for a reason: incredible vocals and a classic pop/R&B sound that is universal. In a current music world where there is so much disposable music occupying the charts it is a pleasure and joy to see the reign of Adele. Those who love Adele should check out another powerhouse of a vocalist from England: the late great Sandy Denny. Her folk/rock music with Fairport Convention Fotheringay and on her solo albums is also music that stands the test of time but it is largely unknown. Check her out if you want to listen to music that will change your life.
She is unique soulful with great vocal texture. As a songwriter she excels as well. Her band is extemely compilmentary and talented. Taylor who???
What an album.  This is what one needs to add to their music collect.  Songs the warm the heart and touch the soul.
I like her voice and some of her songs as it has a different feel.  The CD came quickly and in good condition.
Great album by a great artist but I ended up returning all 4 LP's received because the vinyl was either warped or warped with surface marks that created unacceptable surface noise. The pressing plant responsible for manufacturing this LP and/or the delivery method resulted in an unacceptable product in every case. A big waste of time.
Monotone singer without original songwriting resonation intonation range and evocative voice or stirring songwriting. Sounds like the same recycled generic and uninspiring R&B american idol renditions of what would have been effusive heartfelt and introspective songs by ananis morrisette st vincent beachhouse or bjork. Don't feel any of the teenage angst that reviewers profess to be healing. Wish that in honor of Whitney Houston's evocative and inspiring voice we would have had an artist worthy of a Grammy.
Go figure the physical cd was cheaper than mp3 download (and of course CD is higher quality than mp3 as well).Love love love this album!If you also dig Adele then be sure to check out the DVD of her performing at the Royal Albert Hall. You can stream it but do yourself a favor and get the Blu-Ray especially if you have a good sound system.
This is an exceptional CD that I would and have recommended. I play it constantly hooking family and associates on the pleasant sound.21
Adele is simply wonderful and so is this cd worth every penny. She has such power and passion in every song.
Very Good album. I bought it for the Deep but the rest of the album is also very good. Not really my style in music but she is a great singer.
I got my girlfriend Adele 21 a few weeks ago and she loves it! I have quickly become a huge Adele fan.
After repeated listening to an unbelievable album it's clear that this is the work of a true artist. All the songs on this album are a standout with four cuts above and beyond the rest.  In order of brilliance are Rolling In The Deep He Won't Go Rumor Has It and Turning Tables.  Rolling In The Deep being the obvious HIT is amazing but I think the true hit of this album is He Won't Go. I must have been missing something for a while as I listened to this number many times but never really heard it.  Last night in the car I really heard it for the first time and it totally knocked me out.  It was raining out and I had it on loud and it just ROCKS.  I love a song that has it all from great arrangements incredible production sublime songwriting and most of all a perfect vocal to bring it all home.  Try this song in the car by yourself and turn it up and listen it will blow your socks off.  As for the rest of the album there isn't a bad song anywhere to be found it's BRILLIANT!!
Great album have played it over and over great addition to my CD collection. Also downloaded Skyfall from iTunes. Great
This is Adele Adkins second album and her best. I love her. I hope the quality of her future albums lives up to this one.
"Adele Adkins' second 21 lodged itself atop the charts for quite a while deservedly so.  The leadoff track and hit single ""Rolling in the Deep"" is a driving dismissive lament over a loser lover complete with head-smacking handclaps and a perfectly wailed chorus.  It's followed by an equally compelling ""Rumour Has It"" with its layered call-and-response vocals.  The key to Adele's appeal is her old-school soul a brew of Aretha Franklin Ann Wilson (Heart) and Helen Baylor.  A lukewarm cover of The Cure's ""Lovesong"" is the only misfit because Adele's only innovations are a slower tempo and a slightly altered chorus.  Otherwise 21 is world-wise and ready.  Watch this singer."
Haunting melodic this album sends chills down my spine when I listen to it. Adele doesn't have the vocal range of Leonia Lewis but she is a consummate artist and musician. A throwback artist that may not appeal to Rap aficionados that may find her work boring but for older listeners and younger old school fans she will be deeply appreciated. Her lyrics and talent are glowing the girl is strong forget Winehouse Joss Stone Leonia Lewis this is Englands luminary.
I heard Adele sing one of these song on television. I like her singing so much that I bought the album. This is one of my favorite CD. I play it all the time in my car. Amazon's price was excellent.
"I love female vocalists..... my favorites include Britney Spears Lady Gaga that girl from Garbage Jessica Simpson and last but not least the ever so popular Paris Hilton!  But I was amazed that someone could actually OUTDO all those artists combined...and she is Adele from Australia.  Ever since I heard ""Someone like you"" 5 million times this past week i INSTANTLY knew she was legendary.What more could you ask for? Adele's music has it all!- Generic piano loops- Depressing Lyrics about ex boyfriends- Annoying vocals- Music videos of her walking and singingGenius. That's the only word you can use to describe this amazing Australian singer.I did have to take away 4 stars because Adele didn't have any songs about eating a BigMac at McDonalds; she also doesn't have any sex tapes out yet."
If you've listened to pop radio for no more than 15 minutes a day you've heard a cut from Adele 21!  And for good reason; it's simply a great CD! Get it!  Enjoy; no problem.
Adele won a Grammy for her debut album '19' and while sales rightfully spiked following the awards ceremony none of the singles reached the upper reaches of Billboard and the album faded away after a few weeks. However the lead single from Adele's second set titled 'Rolling in the Deep' seemed to turn that all around. Featured on various television shows the single slowly rose on the charts sparking what was a waning interest in the foreign artist. Adele arrived riding quite the wave with '21' and this was justified considering she possesses one of the best voices in the music industry right now. While '19' was a solid album it suffered from a bit of stuffiness so it had to be considered whether or not Adele would delve into new territory or continue on the path her debut laid out. It turns out she does a bit of both.Rolling in the Deep: The lead single and one of the best songs on the record. The build-up of the verses leads to a powerful chorus and Adele is shown at her very best. A-Rumour Has It: The only other truly up-tempo song aside from the lead single this is a stomping track that deserves single treatment immediately. The breakdown in the bridge followed by a timeless rhythm that sinks into the brain really showcases the type of songs that Adele should be making more of. A-Turning Tables: A nearly stripped-bare ballad Adele does a fantastic job of keeping this one not only afloat but soaring. The emotions feel raw and once again her voice shines through. A vulnerable track that stands at the top. B+Don't You Remember: This is another solid track although it isn't as strong as its predecessors. That's really the only issue here; this one can get forgotten in the shuffle. B-Set Fire to the Rain: The lyrics feel especially strong here or perhaps it's just Adele's exceptional delivery. This one crackles with passion and has a slightly greater tempo than its peers. B+He Won't Go: One of the longer songs this feels a bit repetitive in both lyrics and rhythm. Once again this is not a bad track but it isn't one to ever go searching for amongst the outstanding material that share space on the album. B-Take It All: This is another sparse track that stands tall on Adele's vocals alone which is quite the feat for more than one song on the album to do. There's not much else to say about it; if you enjoy her voice then this is an ideal song. BI'll Be Waiting: This is injected with a lot of passion more so than some of the other tracks and serves it well. An emotional uptempo number which is needed amongst the at-times overwhelming number of ballads. BOne and Only: As the longest track on the album this one does a good job of not dragging or getting repetitive. The piano is nice but overall this is another track that flows politely but doesn't ever ignite. B-Lovesong: The sole cover track Adele does an awesome job. There's not much to it but it's pleasant enough to warrant repeated listens. BSomeone Like You: Far and away the best song on the album. Both lyrically and sonically everything about this one just resounds with power in both the restraint and passion of Adele's singing paired with a beautiful piano part. This is a timeless ballad that shall stand the test of the decade. A+Overall Adele delivers a timeless record that exceeds what '19' created. Given the sales of '21' Adele seems to officially be a mainstream US artist and not a moment too soon. The only complaints I can offer up is that hopefully for her next album she lightens up on the ballads and tries to experiment more with the sound that 'Rumour Has It' hinted at.Recommended Tracks: Rolling in the Deep Rumour Has It Turning Tables Someone Like You
This is a nice little album but there is nothing extraordinary about it. What is amazing is how the British Marketing people have managed to get Adele Duffy Amy Whinehouse and Florence and the Machine all over the radio in the states. Not only that they have managed to get Susan Boyle in the minds of the world. You have to hand it to the British. They know how to play the game.
I had heard a number of these songs on the radio and been captivated but I finally bought the album. I couldn't be more pleased the whole range of songs is enchanting and haunting. The Cure cover is inspired! Highly recommend to those seeking a rich sound from a female vocalist.
Sales figures don't lie and this is a classic timeless album that has stood (and will continue to stand) the test of time. Adele is a pro at such a young age and the songs are very rich emotionally.  I like nearly every song on the album including the Cure cover &#34;Lovesong.&#34; The bonus CD has nothing remarkable on it though...
Adele has that rich 60s feel to her voice.. lots of soul. this vinyl makes me feel like i'm back in the 1960s when listening to it.
A mix if R & B  rock and just good movin music!  Will be hard for her to beat this one....BUT BET SHE DOES!
I love almost all the songs on it. Truly her best work. I did buy a different one before this and was disappointed.
This is amazing on Vinly. So much better then the cd and mp3. So much better qualitey on vinly then CD and mp3! So happy I heard her voice on the Voice TV show. So wonderful to have this collection!
Not a fan of this singer but bought it as a wish-list requested gift for my son and glad he likes it.
as a music fan and muscian i stick mostly to classic rock and randb oldies as my main music but this album and artist is a rare thing these days bought this album for my brother and he played it all the time and got me into Adele.she is in her early 20's so she will only get better.Adele has a great voice and there are some nice melodies on this album I wish she would try to rock out a bit more but i am a ballad type of guy so i like her songs a lot.best songs Turning Tables nice vocal catchy melodie should be a single best song for meRollin In The Deep is the closet to a rock and roll song that Adele gets great backing vocals like church i heard it when the album came out a few years ago on an alternative radio station.Someone Like You is nice but there are enough ballads on here.if Adele puts some rock songs to go with the ballads she will be even bigger than she is today.I give this album a 4 rating
I love Adele and looked forward to receiving the CD. The CD came packaged perfect with no damage. The songs were awesome too.
"Adele could teach the current generation of girl power singers a thing or two.  With her huge expressive voice modernized version of the Motown sound and emotionally compelling lyrics she has written an album that is almost as good as pop music can get.  I've probably listened to it two dozen times now and it's just growing on me more and more.As I said Adele's voice is huge and expressive such a crowd pleaser that the first time I heard her I assumed she was a graduate of American or British Idol.  (In fact she's even more democratic than that -- she got her break as a self-published MySpace hit then got discovered.)This isn't quite a concept album I really like that it's got enough of a theme to it to make listening to the whole album a different experience from the sum of its parts.  Adele apparently wrote it while getting over a breakup and that loss forms the theme.  The songs go after her ex plead with him cry at him and ultimately come to a kind of peace.  Even her cover of the Cure's ""Lovesong"" which some people think is the weakest part of the album works really well in this context -- singing along with old Cure songs is exactly what I would expect a heartbroken 21 year old to do.  (And I like the cover a lot for the record.)The lyrics are often beautiful and haunting enough that I can easily overlook a few clunkers (like her ex playing Adele's heart ""to the beat"" or Adele being ""born and raised"" in a ""summer haze.) and they tell real stories using a few words to paint a whole relationship.The music and production is just about perfect -- a modernized Motownish sound that goes perfectly with Adele's soulful performance and tight cleanly produced songs.Since it holds together I strongly recommend the full album but if you're looking for a few tracks to sample I strongly recommend :Rolling in the Deep"" ""Rumor Has It"" ""Set Fire to the Rain"" and ""Someone Like You"" as starting points."
I hate Adele her music is too mellowdramatic for me. I have enough sadness in my life now I have to listen to her bellyache!!!!
I have to agree with many of the reviewers who give this CD low marks for production quality. The CD sounds OK on your average car stereo but play it on decent equipment at good volume and it's pretty awful. My equipment is by no means sub-par; in fact it actually makes many mediocre disks sound pretty fantastic. I enjoy listening to female artists similar to Adele like Alanis Macy Gray Indigo Girls even Kate Bush and they all sound excellent. This is the ONLY one I've ever been so disappointed with. The bass is especially bad sounding very boomy and almost like it's out of phase. Of course if you check out the Wikipedia article on this CD you'll see that it really went through production hell so that might explain the very uneven quality.I have the vanilla USA no-frills version of the CD; I'm going to buy another copy maybe one of the foreign releases with the bonus tracks and see if it's any better. Because there's no doubt that Adele herself is quite awesome! Meanwhile don't get mad at the reviewers who dis this disc based on the sound quality; they're telling the truth. For one of the best-selling albums of all time the listening public deserves better treatment and so does Adele.
Great CD with 3 huge hits.This woman's talent is absolutely astounding!Best album I have heard in a long time
If you are going to listen to pop you may as well listen to Adele.  She has an incredible voice as displayed on this album.
her voice is so lovely and pure strong and sure words are timeless like this album more than than the first
It is really great.  I love her voice.  The music sounds great on my kindlefirer.  I would recomended it to my friends.
This is a GREAT CD.  Goes wherever we go....or at least where my husband goes.  I can't wrestle it away from him to play in my car!
YOU CAN'T GO WRONG SHE'S ONE OF THE MOST BRILLIANT NEW ARTIST THAT'S COME AROUND IN A  LONG TIME.  NONE BETTER SINCE JANIS - THE PEARL.
Super fast shipping. As always Amazon has excellent packaging. As for as the CD I haven't listened to the whole thing yet. So far it's OK. I was expecting it to be a little more upbeat.
Great CD. Not every single single song is awesome but most are pretty good. And both my 3 year old and 5 year old love it! That is awesome that Adele can appeal to ages 3 to 41!
This girl is really talented! Not only can she sing she is truly a gifted lyricist. I am so glad that I purchased this CD.
Bought this to try something new. Ended up really enjoying it. I think she does a great job producing this album.
What can I say but that this is a great album capturing Adele at her best. Amazon's price is excellent for this album better than I could reasonably expect from a local establishment.
Don't buy CD's very often but don't always like what's on the radio in the car. Great listening for summer cruising!
I have not listened to pop music for years but not sure this is entirely in that genre.  The voice on this lady has excellent range and she sings with such passion.  I can honestly say this is the best singer currently out there that I have been exposed to.  Great album especially if you are going thru a rough breakup.
"Asked for this for Xmas basically because I'd heard ""Rolling"" repeatedly on a fuzzy car-radio driving the US west and ""Someone Like You"" on an equally-crummy transistor while in Yosemite last year. Skeptical because I've bought more than my share since the 80's on and got burned on one good song...Got home and heard most of this on CD on proper 'phones--I am for once speechless.The sound for one is simply incredible. Nothing in the way of the listener and the message. Amy Winehouse--to which Adele is often compared--is ultimately Pepsi to Adele's Classic Coke. ""Rolling in the Deep"" is truly the Real thing.I've cautiously dug Adele since ""Chasing Pavements"" but feared in typical shallow Yank fashion she was simply too obese to make it in the States. Boy was I wrong. Great voice beats a plump face anytime even here. My Mum saw me open the Amazon package and said ""Oh is that the one supposed to be so good ?"" And of course it was--turned it up on the 'phones held it out and she said ""Oh yes it is good."" And my Mum generally doesn't like music. So for this to grab her is for me a pretty big deal.All the reviews dig this and guess why ? 500+ people taking the time to write about after all only a record album is these days a damn big deal. Just buy it and dig in. If newest single ""Fire to the Rain"" doesn't grab you too bad.Just buy it. You'll wonder why you didn't before.Five stars ***** And a sixth for not suckering me with one good song.Just get it !!"
I have listed to the album multiple times now.  It has a very bluesy R&B sound that is soulful at times and rebellious at others.
Adele's voice is so pure and kind of sultry.  I love it.  The music on this cd is fabulous.  I am so glad I bought it.
Great Cd! I haven't stopped listening to it since I bought it. Arrived in 1 day with the 2 day shipping.
Great disc from a great artist. We listen to this every day.  Family is very happy to have and look forward to the next one.
Amazing.  Absolutely amazing that a voice is that beautiful. Great product and price.  Very pleased with the purchase.  Highly recommend for anyone that enjoys talented music artists.
Gave my coworker this CD since she likes Adele and she loves it.  There is even a version of &#34;Love Song&#34; on there that I didn't know she covered!
"I really dig this cd. I only gave it four stars because I don't like a few songs. Other than that great cd. The girl can ""SANG!"""
I requested it from Argentina the disk arrived in very good condition and sooner than expected. It is a great Album with the best songs from Adele. The highly recommend for all lovers of good music and also recommend to buy it at Amazon warranty of reliability quality and respect for the customer around the world.
I'm really happy for purchase this audio disc it's cheap fast delivered amazing audio quality not complaint about that.The box is in paperboard material inside of them will found a little book with pictures of Adele and the band but not have song lyrics.
Since this was a requested gift for my granddaughter I really have no way of rating it.  I just took a guess.
Adele is great - buy it - Not much more to say.  convenience of down load along with the CD was really nice feature
I got this CD for Christmas and just keep listening to it.  Adele's voice is so strong and you can feel the emotion in the songs.  It is a great gift.  Adele please keep on putting out wonderful music.
I love Adele and this album will not disappoint those of you who love her talent and her music.  All of the songs are beautifully written and performed and the arrangements are wonderful.  I am looking forward to more of her music.
I was not too familar with Adele when I bought this CD and I was simply blown away.  Her voice her musical complexity her depth of feeling her creativity. I'm not a fan of rock but she transcends rock in my opinion. To me she is almost symphonic. She's that good.
I was very pleased with my Adele 21 cd that I ordered and also pleased at the quickness of the delivery from Amazon.com.  I would recommend this cd to anyone.  I am hooked on the Amazon site now.
Many great hits on the download and when the mood strikes you a great choicefor easy listening music. Highly recommend.
OMG! What a voice ! I love all but one song on this CD. SHe is a genius & the music really makes you move. It also helps you emote! I listened to it non-stop for hours after I received it. I would highly recommend this album to any folks who are new to Adele's brilliance! YES!XXX
This is such a great CD one I can listen to over and over again.  Love every song on it!
Love the music. Downloaded to my Kindle so I can listen to music while I am reading. Love her voice.
There is absolutely nothing that I can find wrong with this album. Absolutely amazing. Definitely deserved album of the year.
Every song on this album is good and exactly what you would expect.  I certainly understand why all the grammys for this album.
Loved the timely fashion this CD arrived loved that it did not skip and loved Adele! Good choice I made~
"I've been an Adele fan since she released her first album and enjoy ""19"" very much. I was front row at her concert for that album and I must say that her voice is as flawless in person. I felt so honored to be in her presence.---Just when I thought she couldn't get any better she releases ""21"". I can't even begin to describe how much I enjoy this album. She deserves every award she is nominated for for this album. She is such a ""powerhouse"". Not one day goes by when I don't listen to at least one song from this album! (I'm partial to ""Rolling In The Deep"" and ""Lovesong"" (cover)) You MUST BUY this album because it's absolutely amazing! I think there's something on it for people to relate to in all types of situations from break-ups to the recovery she puts it out there! If this album doesn't win ""Album of The Year at next years Grammy awards something is terribly wrong with the music industry! I love Adele so much! Enjoy!"
Here is an album that will not only agree with the anger of your broken heart but will also recognize the yearning for past love and do it so that you can dance yourself to a new attitude. This is CHICKEN SOUP FOR YOUR DANCING SOUL!
Adele is such a masterful singer that every single track on this album was amazing!  It is by far one of my favorite CDs of all time.
Sweet young lady. She has a true talent and the voice of an angel. I could listen to her music all day.
This girl is so freakin talented! I don't care how many times her songs are played I never grow tired of them.
Love her voice and the melodies! This album has a few songs which have become stuck in my head!  I appreciate that I haven't heard any awful language coming from this album.  Good girl!!  Am disappointed there are no lyrics with it. That would have been perfect.  Am looking forward to more from Adele.  God bless her...
Not going to repeat the review of the music which is beautiful.I purchased this 3/19/2012 evening received it the next day via UPS (Prime member).  Excellent packaging.  Disc is heavy-duty high quality; perhaps 180 or 200 gram audiophile-quality pressing.  Included was a coupon with a digital download code which worked so I now have the vinyl mp3's on my Macbook (added to iTunes library) and burnt a CD for car use.  Super product.
Adele has a spectacular voice however every song was a 'love' story gone bad.  Would have really enjoyed this CD if it included up beat music too. When you have lost someone you love dearly this is very depressing.
Although I have trouble connecting or feeling excited about some of the pieces Adele's incredible voice and passion keep me coming back again and again. Very very good music that showcases one of the best vocalists I've heard in a long time.
....everything Adele does is fabulous.  I have played this CD over and over since getting it.  I'm certain my significant other wishes it would end.  It's a great CD from beginning to end....
Made it to the destination with no hassle or worry. You friggin rock Amazon! I will always utilize your services.
Heard a coulple of her songs and enjoyed them.  Decided to download this album.  I listen out on radio for any new songs of hers.
How could you not love this collection of fine songs by Adele; several on this album made the top hits lists
Love the CD!  Delivery of item was really fast.  However I wish I had known the words to the songs were not included in the insert of the CD.
Love it. Count me among the legions of Adele fans. It's in my car's CD player right now on loop.
I love this woman's voice! She is such a rare talent - her songs touch a range of emotions. I love this album!
This is one of the greatest CDs I have ever purchased and a great price. I loved every song on the CD
Adele has one of those voices that is so natural and soothing to the soul she is very healing to the soul.
I pre-ordered this great CD but the day it went on sale for everyone it was cheaper than it was on the pre-order. Arg :-/ Never again !!
Love her voice. Love the album. Love that I ordered it from Amazon. Never been disappointed with anything I ordered from Amazon.
Just love her voice - good price and quick ship.  Package was sealed and in excellent condition.  Glad I can still purchase CD's since I do not use an Iphone or MP3!
I am a recent convert to Adele's music but she has made me a believer.  Her lyrics and her delivery absolutely transport you into her world.  In other words I thoroughly enjoy her.
Adele is just awesome very powerful vocals looking forward to her next album and I hope that it is as good as this one!
I heard Adele sing Rolling in the Deep on NPR and later listened to the entire CD on their website.  It has been a long time since I felt compelled to purchase any music but this CD was a must have.  Love the music.
didn't work sent it back 3 weeks ago and nothing back yet what a rip off last time for getting a tape online
"It's no wonder an X Factor judge said he was ""sick of Adele"".  All the contestants do covers of her songs because the songs are imminently sing-able with wonderful lyrics and phrasing.  Adele is a little of everything:  country alternative blues even a little ""go-gos"" (think: Rumor has it).  A very listenable and lovely album!"
LoveAdele 21.  LIsten to it all the time.  LOve that I can get it on my Kindle Fire.  Use it when traveling.
I have nothing to say except I'm wearing the cd out.  Absolutely love this cd - always on in my car and in the house.  Awesome
I have listened to this CD over and over and never grow tired of it.  Great music great voice---just love it!
We listen to this soo much I finally put it up for awhile as I was wondering just how much Adele I can listen to before it drove me crazy! lol! My girls LOVE this and so do I. All the songs are great to listen and sing along with. Has to be her best cd so far!
Have wanted this CD for some time.  When I received a gift card as a gift this was the first thing I thought to purchase.
I requested and got this CD for Christmas. There is so much emotion in Adele's songs. I had to drive 2 hours from home today and listened to this CD the whole way.
This is one of the best listing ever! Super for all age groups and the music is upbeat yet relaxing. Love it!
Great cd!  From start to finish this cd is a really great listen!  Adele's voice is absolutely beautiful!  Get this cd!
I am a big fan of Adele's first CD '19'.  So when I saw I could pre-order this on Amazon I did so right away.  Pre-ordering is my new favorite thing.  It arrived so quickly!  Also it was price guaranteed so I recieved a $2 reimbursement because it went on sale somewhere!Adele's newest CD is wonderful soulful and filled with such honest emotion.  I love to listen to the disc in the kitchen while cooking it's wonderful.If you enjoyed her first CD you'll love '21' if you are just looking for someone with a gorgeous voice to sing the blues get this disc!
Talk about liquid gold in a cd.  Adelle has the richest voice and her styling and phrasing is unmatched!  I can listen to her sing all day long!  EVERY song on this cd is GREAT!
This CD is a definite 4.5 in my book but Amazon just doesn't like half stars.I love Rolling in the Deep and Set Fire to the Rain. Turning Tables is just a wonderfully lush arrangement and I am finding myself getting fonder and fonder of Love Song. It's very '60s cabaret lounge-y but in a good way. There are a couple of songs I don't care for but that's more so due to my personal preference than a reflection of the songs themselves. Number four - Don't you Remember I just don't care for the country feel of it and number eight I'll Be Waiting too Dusty Springfield for my liking. The pacing of the lyrics don't quite meet up with the music. But that's just my opinion so if someone likes them I won't quibble as I'm musically uneducated. Only got my ears to use as a tool.Adele is probably gonna clean up at the Grammys next year with this offering.I wish there were more artists like her and less like Katy Perry.
"Adele has an incredible voice for TODAY's mainstream music. She sings passionately and you can tell she speaks from personal experience. And in today's impersonal chant-driven melody lacking beat obsessed top forty play list she is a nice break. But she's not a god. she's not the next Aretha Franklin. She doesn't do anything new she takes us back in time and does an old trick pretty well.  I have to say that sometimes the way she phrases words makes me cringe because it sounds so affected. There are my criticisms about her.Now this album. It is an improvement from the first one in the sense that there are several OUTSTANDING songs. 19 just had a nice overall feel to it. However this album has several really incredible songs and the rest while nice are not really that great. in fact i dont even listen to most of this album. i do however love: Rolling in the deep Rumour Has it Turning Tables Someone Like you and her cover of lovesong which is really pretty/dreamlike and not ""unnecessary"" as i recall the rollingstone review labeling it. And set fire to the rain is a runner up for the ""tracks i listen to off this album occasionally"" category. But really that's all i took away from this album. She's lacking as a truly skillful songwriter and could stand to improve. She's a talent that needs better material. But yes there are several instant classics here its just not a classic overall.I know you're going to hate on me and tell me i dont understand blah blah blah. Zip your lip like a pad lock i dont care. Adele has great potential  but i'll wager that unless someone breaks her heart even more she won't have any new tricks on a third go around if she ever gets around to it."
This CD has lots of big hits included plus many that may become your favorite.  Adele's voice is amazing.  A good find.
I don't know how she does it but all the songs of this album are filled with soulful lyrics and beautiful melodies. I highly recommend this.
I love love love this CD.  It's been out a long time but finally got around to purchasing it and can't stop listening to it.  She is a miraculous singer.
"I ADORE ADELE. She is the most soulful honest real incredible talent out there today. Her sold out world tour is proof enough but you don't need other people to tell you she's a unique rarity.I saw Adele in concert in San Francisco on Jan. 29 2009 at The Harfield. I can remember it like it happened last night.  She's a juxposition of what she presents with and projects at first glance and then she begins to sing and you know without a doubt if you too have depth that this soulful honest extrodinary god given gift of a talent is exposing herself right before a bunch of strangers. She's letting you in on pain she's felt in her past and opening and projecting with her powerful voice and all you want to do is plant yourself firmly and keep yourself from being swept away but then you finally give up after five torturous seconds and release all inhibitions and go with the magic of the knowledge that while Adele is singing live in front of you that you are having an incredible musical experience.  I hope it's not a once in a lifetime experience for me but I know it's difficult to get tickets for her live performances after she increased some performances in the US the LA and SF sold out too quickly for me to get tickets.If you doubt this listen to ""Someone Like You.""  Also youtube ""Fool That I Am"" dear Lord that woman has depth.  She feels deep.  She also will give us more I'm sure as she as a person goes through more life experiences. Hopefully she'll be with someone she can be safe with and the world of true love will open for her.  Songs might come about that are so soaring that we'll benefit.  Right now as she describes herself as 'heartbroken soul' I want one day for her not to go through heartbreak.  You leave after one of her performances wanting the best for her.  She just lets you in and be privay to some of her past emotional pain and it leaves you loving how unpretencious she is. To say you have a bright future ahead of you Miss Adele if you want it is probably an understatement.  Want it she does she's given up drinking and now tackling stopping smoking it hurts her though from what I've read if that's a true quote (you have to be careful what you read).  She might of seen how she could let her pain sweep her down stream to a dark lake and she is taking control instead of what could take control of her.  She remind me of a tree solid in the ground soaring above most and growing all the time.I had her CD quite awhile before the concert.  I didn't go to see her actually I was there to see James Morrison who opened for her.  It was a sold out concert because of everyone there to see Adele not James Morrison most people I talked to hadn't heard of James Morrison.  I of course liked both but after James sang the mood of anticipation for Adele in the room was palpable. She came on stage all in black her hair wrapped loose in the back in a chignon kind of thing and a black wrap around her shoulder with ballet flats.  Her body language was insecure and kind of girlish she kind of shuffled in a kind of young girl way to the microphone.  It surprised me because my CD of her was not what I expected of her.Then she started to speak in her British accent kind of Cockneyish to me.  I loved her accent and then she introduced her first songI was instantly smiling loving her the minute she came out.  The stage was sparse with musicians she had four violinists with her which I was looking forward to but other than that just a handful of musicians and her and...ADELE'S VOICE.  She began her first song and the room was completely all soul encompassing listening to every beautiful note.  Her sophistication her magic her gift had us all captivated.  She could sing really basically anything and it would be good.  It's how she sings it her depth delivery and how she FEELS a song and you feel it right along with her. I liked her before but after her performance I was a devoted fan.Between her pure talent her taste and songwriting skills on top of that this women could andI am sure will have a lifelong career if she wants.  She is that good.  She kind of defies her persona that voice seeming to come out of nowhere but just as an artist paints a beautiful piece of art she delivers divine and it's always with her. I wanted to ask her ""Do you really realize how good you are?""  I think she knows but what she gives to her audience you are amazed that voice comes out of her her youth that much sophistication.  I felt like Etta James was embodied in her with a intuition of soul and jazz amd it's her beauty of face and smile. I left wishing the best for her in her life.  Also wondering what would I give to have the gift that she has to be able to express the depth of my soul through a kind of caliber of talent she possesses.Today in my car I had track three 'Turning Tables' on repeat it's so good it hurts.  'Rolling in the Deep' is burns it's so good.  One day she won't be a woman scorned.  ""He Won't Go' eludes to that.  ""Take it All"" breaks my heart.  I so relate to it.  Thanks Adele.  As Adele grows and doesn't need validation from males and as she let's it sink in how much she is validated her fans can't because she knows that do not know her so all of the validation won't do it through her music I believe it will be her risking to let herself be even more vunerable and let break all walls down no more stormy relationships no more trying to find comfort from the wrong places we'll all wish or her the greatness ahead for her.Meanwhile I will always love Adele be devoted loyal and always buy her music.  Her uniqueness that beautiful beautiful porceline skin that is so more than one would realize that dimple in her chin those large expressive green sparkling gems of eyes she has that give you a glimpse of her depth and that manner of hers when she puts in nail between her teeth a gesture I love that she does her laugh her taste her gutsy ballsy confidence that she projects that could be what she projects to protect her all of it makes me love her more.  There is not one singer in the world today that I could think is anyone close to what I feel for how I love and relate to Adele.  Gaga's little monsters meanwhile as they are all caught in all the hype we have her purity all she needs is her voice and all that depth she has.  I love when she said in her ballyness 'I don't rely on my tits to make hits.""  Love you Adele!Adele's latest with her great taste and talentis the reason we buy music.  Her career will I feel certain as she continues to live and experience more and more will keep rising. I look forward to her future songs her music is going to be a continual benefit for her appreciative and devoted listeners.  This is music as it was meant to be when you want it to speak to the soul."
This is one of my favourite albums ever. Adele has such a mesmerising voice and it's put to good use in some brilliant songs with excellent lyrics. A real talent.
She's very talented with an amazing voice and I found I liked most of the songs on the cd not just the coupe of hits that had been played on the radio when I purchased it.
Over all a good CD. Some of the songs were just okay and I'm sick of the most popular ones by now but some really caught me.  Turning tables is probably my favorite.
This is an excellent CD. Song selection arrangements and vocals are great. I would recommend this CD especailly to those who like Adele
"I never heard of Adele until hearing ""Rolling in the Deep"" and I liked the song so much that I downloaded the entire CD.I don't have to say much...simply this is the best CD that has come out in years.  From start to finish it is incredible...Adele's voice is haunting and gritty at the same time and her songs can be played over and over without getting tired of it.""21"" has been on repeat on my ipod for days and it is not getting old.  Buy it buy it buy it!"
Get both of her CD's but this one is even better. Great as back ground music or to sing along with she's a great addition to anyone's home entertainment.
I think Adele is great beautiful and unique sound and very catchy. I plan to buy a couple more of her albums to see how she has progressed.
This is the greatest CD. I love all of the music and the variety is perfect. Thanks so much :)
Adele is an amazing vocalist with untapped raw emotion---her sophomore effort is fabulous!  I look forward to seeing her for years to come!
Incredible music.  I don't buy music unless I believe it to be very good and this CD is great!  I waited a long time to purchase.
Amazing....simply amazing.  I am going to purchase Adele's first CD and I will certainly be following her musical career.Her voice is skilled beyond comprehension.  I don't hear her transitions coming....she just nails them ever so smoothly.
This is an amazing CD but I knew that before I bought it.  Call me nostalgic but I was tired of purchasing albums on itunes and I saw this one was the same price.  If you give me the option I'd rather have the actual disc.  It was shipped quickly and the disc played perfectly in the car.  Adele truly has an amazing voice and there is not a bad song on the album.  This was a great deal at $9.99.
This is still one of my favorite CDs to listen to. I love Adele. True talent which is so hard to find in music these days. Recommend this CD to everyone!
I like her music. It is fresh. I hope she continues to produce new music. (And ignores the mean girl reviews).
I don't know why but I just recently purchased this CD. It is a very beautiful set of songs. They stir my heart and many other music lovers. Adele has such a unique sound. I recommend this CD plus other Cd's that she has out at this time to all music lovers.
This a great CD which I bought for My daughter. She's a big fan of Adele so this was a no-brainer! Amazon shipping is hassle free and super easy. Thx Amazon!!!
this CD is my all-time favorite...whenever I'm having a relaxed chill or happy day this CD always makes it better. i actually bought it for my grandmother as well and she's always listening to it.
It belongs on vinyl totally. It is better than expected and I listen to it whenever I get the chance.
if you don't like adele..may i say you do not like people who sing..lol...her voice is astonishing..buy the whole album just to hear him beautiful effortless voice blare through..and ofcourse my favorite songs are on this album..all the famous singers of today are even blown away by her voice..no one can copy her distinct sound..love it.
People who know me know how unashamedly I can be critical about music. Yes babies I sort through all the vocals and orchestrations with a fine tooth comb (which forgive me enters through the gates of banality). Or better yet I am an aspiring Sherlock Holmes (no not H.H.) using my trusty magnifying glass to examine all nuances contained within each music proffering. Believe me I am not known for holding back any criticism if I feel it justified. Well never mind all that. The point is I bought 21 some time ago but I waited awhile to post this because so many people raved about it that I thought it best to hold back (for dramatic effect and also to wait for a certain unsuspecting public that I could unleash this review on). Anyway after many hours of experiment subjecting the c.d. to exactly the right amount of chemicals and believe it or not actually listening to it many times. I have the w(r)it and hereby decree that this here Adele 21 is ......FLAWLESS and ESSENTIAL to any serious music collection.There I said it. For more in-depth information search the other 5 star reviews. I am too exhausted to do it myself. Used up all my energy devoted to giving this review the in-depth study it deserves.P.S. She didn't win some bogus talent show to be known. She is a natural and doesn't need Simon Cowell's help. Hooray!Buy it today.
I should have purchased this CD when it first came out. Now I've already heard most of the songs before I downloaded it. It's still an amazing CD. Adele sounds even better when on a CD versus a radio. Still there wasn't enough new content to warrant me buying the disk.
No need to wait for the rest of 2011 the Grammys should be held right now and Adele should take a truckload home. What a phenomenal album!Still selling at fullprice everywhere and still topping the charts!
I bought this cd as a present; but by the time I received it in the mail it was broken in 2 places.  Guess I need to buy another one...bummer. I know the music from listening online...the music is fabulous!
I love me some Adele. She is an amazing singer. Only disappointment was my CD case came and it was broken and the center of it was broken as well so it does not hold the CD in the case
I was introduced to this singer just a week ago on a (3 day) trip with my daughter and grandsons. Heard the cd a 'few' times woke up with it stuck in my head. I just bought it can hardly wait to find it in my mailbox. She is a mix between DIDO and Tracy Chapman.
What can I say?  Who doesn't know how amazing Adele is at this point or all of the accolades that this album has received?  So many great songs whether they made the charts or not.  Song after song you just get drawn in to that gorgeous velvety voice.  If you haven't listened to Adele before this is the album to get.
"Adele just sings my soul and I'm sure millions of other people on this entire album. She goes through the whole range of emotions in relationships from ""Rolling in the Deep"" to ""Someone Like You"". If you're looking to fall in love with a new artist lately and you aren't familiar with Adele buy this album and you will be hooked. I can't think of another vocalist out there right now that has the depth and range that she does."
WINNER OF SIX OUT OF SIX GRAMMY NOMINATIONS FOR THIS ALBUM THE ONE AND ONLY LOVELY AND TALENTED ADELE!! BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!! lol ^^
"This album is absolutely epic! I can count on one hand how many albums I can listen to all the way through without skipping a track and Adele's 21 has just made #4. This album is so personal and heartfelt that you can't help but be in love with it. I found out that the basis of the album was her hard break-up with her boyfriend. After listening to the words of each song I realize how vuknerable and open Adele is about speaking out publicly about the relationship. She does it with great expression and you can feel her emotions through each song. My favorites are ""Set Fire to the Rain"" ""Lovesong"" ""Don't you Remember"". I can't wait until her next album! I love her voice her musical style and the wonderful ballads. This album will not disappoint!"
This album is amazing! I'm so glad I bought it.  I have listened to it over and over. I don't think there is one song on the CD that I don't like.  She's a timeless and extremely talented artist.
Love her voice and her lyrics. One of the best CDs I have heard in a long time. I listen to it almost every day!!!
She's so soulful. This degree of honest vocal artistry is what's missing from the contemporary music scene. Adele's vocal style honors those jazz blues r&b and rock artists who came before her without coming across as too nostalgic yet her tone is fresh and awakening.
I had no idea this young lady existed until I heard an American Idol contestant sing Rolling in the Deep one evening.  I loved the song and searched for more information on the artist listened to samples of her music.  Then I purchased 21 and am hooked.  I will be buying more of Adele's music.  I am a middle aged cat lady and will have this CD wore out in the near future.  I see from the other reviews that others have also noticed Adele has a multi-generational appeal.  Hope to be hearing her music for a long time.
Such a rare talent - and not just marketing buzz.  I bought this an 19 which I have not listened to yet.
I liked the quality of the product and the speedy delivery. There were no surprises and I have thoroughly enjoyed listening to the music.
Really liked most of the songs on this album...i wish &#34;i found a boy&#34; was on this one but it's not.
I bought this book for my 14 year old son who plays the piano and loves Adele.  He is working on learning to play her music and is getting quite good at it.  I even ordered the Adele 19 easy piano book for him for Christmas...shhhh!Thanks for a great product.
I love this album.  Adele has a wonderful voice and she is a great performer.  I enjoy listening to her sing.
Super beautiful every song is magical.  I love her voice and each song is so emotional you feel like she wrote it just for you.
I was very surprised that I liked this album because I never liked one song on her first album. I realize this isn't an album for everyone but I did like it
I bought the cd for christmas as a gift for my mother.  My mother loved it.  She played it constantly.
Adele has an awesome voice this whole album is just wonderful. You will want to Play it over and over again
To express why it means something for an album to be part of my top ten favorites let me explain that there are only about fifteen albums that I would tell someone are my favorites. Sure I somewhat enjoy a few other albums but I only half-enjoy and often half-detest those albums. This album is fabulous and it quickly became one of my favorites. I was never into Adele before but she is one of the artists I wanted to get into because I liked her voice. She has a nice voice but I heard Chasing Pavements before I knew it was so popular and I just didn't like it. I still don't know why people like that song. I heard more from 19 over the years and just couldn't get into her. Last year in December I watched vh1's top 20 countdown (which I've been watching for years to keep up with what people my age are listening to and hopefully discover some good new songs--and I do but it's very rare) premier her Rolling In the Deep video. They premiered it on the last week before their two- or three-week Holiday break. I enjoyed the song so I got it online and listened to it almost non-stop whenever I was on the computer. After about fifteen listens I realized that I loved the song and wanted to hear more. I found myself getting upset that they had premiered that video the week before a long vacation because I knew that people weren't going to vote for it because they hadn't seen it or didn't realize it had premiered. Sure enough when it debuted on the countdown it was 20 but the next week it was like 13. I checked out her live performance of Someone Like You on Jools Holland. At first I wasn't into it but I listened to it some more and it is great. When the album leaked I listened to it in order to see if I wanted the album. After I heard it a few times it was obvious that it had become a favorite of mine. It's a great album. My favorite tracks are Rolling In the Deep I'll Be Waiting One And Only and her cover of If It Hadn't Been For Love. I don't care much for Rumour Has It and He Won't Go. I also don't like her version or the original version of Lovesong. Someone Like You is much better live.
I am by no means in Adele's target audience but I thoroughly enjoy her singing and I must say I play this CD over and over in my car while I'm going around town doing my errands. She's a great talent and the songs are beautifully sung.
Beautiful CD beautiful Voice one of the most unique voices I've ever heard.. Love it... Brilliant lyrics I'm a very lyrical person and hers are amazing...I  Listen to this on repeat her older music is worth a listen too...highly recommend...
Great CD
What can I say? I love her voice and this CD is awesome. I hope she is around for years! What talent!
"I keep a variety of lists.  I'm such a critic and that's what we do.  I can recommend the best foods to eat cars to drive and clothes to wear.  I also have a ""Best Albums"" list.  As you can imagine this is a very short list because while there are many great songs and find artists there aren't very many ""best albums."" Then along comes Adele to save the day.  I feel her music so much and her voice is so melodic and so amazing.  This is an album that you buy insert into your cd/mp3 player and let it play because you're not going to need to skip over any of the songs since each track is ALL THAT.  I'm not heartbroken nor am I struggling to get over a past love but there's still so much identity in her music.  Call it the human experience call it an expression of love call it feelings from one soul to another or simple call it good music!  We have certainly been blessed by the presence of Adele. She oozes with talent & creativity and her album is a class act.  She gives so much of herself in each song and when she sings you get a sense that you're listening to someone who was born to share her voice with us. Thank you Adele we are indeed all ears."
Great singer great voice but mediocre songs which sound the same repetitive chord changes repetitive ideas.  Needs to seek out some good songwriters and perform some good tunes.
"This album has better more clear production when compared to her debut album and is pretty interesting too. I believe ""21"" is/was a pretty good step in her career yet I'm not absolutely amazed by either of her discs yet. Ofcourse I look forward to more yet I'm not really sure how much more change we'll be hearing from her next album/s ya know? ""21"" is a good album but not consistently good (as in from one song to the next) overall so I can only hope for an even better album coming from her soon. Let's have ""23"" or ""24"" (or whatever Adele's next album might be called) explode into this world as a ""classic"" that'll shock and impress even her biggest fans AND critics! Yeah that could be too much to ask but if Adele really is a great artist it should be expected and/or demanded! Period!"
Most pop artists are not worth my time to listen to much less buy their albums. Adele is such a timeless classic talent that 21 is one of the most enjoyable albums I've bought in a long time. If you have not heard several tracks from this album you must have been living under a rock.
I've been listening to this CD in my car over and over.  I absolutely love Adele's voice and what she sings about.  Great CD great price.
Congratulating Adele for '21' surpassing the 10 million units sold in the U.S.giving '21' it's Diamond Certification! In the summer of 2012 she needed 500000 to make it and I thought it would be early 2013 before she made it.But when I first heard the excellent 'Skyfall' Bond theme I knew that new fans who loved Skyfall would go and buy '21'! and it looks like they did!(probably got '19' too)! I usually don't boast but this for all the Adele haters who by the way  might as well get ready as she could win another Grammy and an Oscar for 'Skyfall'! Congrats Adele!
A beautifully strong voice singing heartfelt lyrics.  Her music encompasses multiple genres and is enjoyed by young and old alike which is more unusual these days.
So I've heard about Adele for so long now I was really turned off by the name alone because I had imagined another media-driven artist such as Lady Gaga that I'm just sick of hearing about... boy was I wrong.  The songs are ridiculous in every way her range and depth of vocal power is world class and possibly the best I've heard from my generation and I can't think of anyone even close.  I'm not a woman but the lyrics still resonate with me just the same.  If you don't feel somewhat emotional on at least 1 of these tracks then you probably haven't had many life experiences and lucky you.  I've been listening to this CD every day for a few weeks now and have watched the Live performance at Royal Albert Hall probably 10 times it's just mesmerizing.  Google that Live performance and watch some video on YouTube of it this will help make up your mind about buying the CD if you're on the fence.Buy It.
"What makes this album unique is that it tells an entire story. We feel her love her pain and we can painfully empathize with the feel of a broken and mending heart.  It's obvious that the love she sings about is a haunting to her and she carries us through with ""Fire to the Rain"" ""Turning Tables"" and ""Someone Like You.""  Adele's sophomore album is refined because she was obviously healing through her songs. Beautiful."
I am so grateful to finally hear something different then the pop music that seems to be all over the place. Adele's voice is somewhat old fashioned but it works despite her young age. When you hear her voice you start to think she is older than she actually is. Adele has a way of bringing you into the music your listening to so that you actually feel the song just like you should when listening to incredible music.However Adele's music won't be for everyone. If you are the type of person who is die hard only like Rap or hip hop or has to have bubble gum pop and nothing else it might not be the best choice for you.I recommend having an open mind and really giving her a chance you might surprise yourself with how much you like a new genre of music and how much you like an artist who has a true and real talent. Adele has one of those voices that is just magical and I hope that we see much more of her in the future because we needed an artist like this nowadays. It's great to finally have something that isn't like everything else out there.
"I think Adele 21 is absolutely fantastic. Not just one song but about five get me moving! Highly recommend this to all ages. I am in my 50's and am nostalgic for music from the late 50's and early 60""s so this style is not my normal listening music but it is on my iPod and I repeat her songs many times. I really can't say enough on this lady! I hope she is coming out with another soon. Love her voice her emotion and her beat. I would love to see her in concert....albeit an intimate setting."
I love Adele. Her voice the first time I heard it...I had been so amazed. She is so good. What I like about this album is the consistancy in it. It's got a story within a story from how the tracks are running down the line. To every song on this album has such a feast for the senses. Her voice to the melody and down into the instrumental sound. I can't get enough of her and if you like soul blues r & b-Adele is seriously for you. She's got it made I can't wait until I get the next album.
Fantastic music. I'm addicted to this cd. It has a rhythm that just carries you along. I listen to it over and over and over.
I love Adele music and the music quality is great. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who likes Adele's music. You'll love it!
Adele demonstrates an ability to match her fabulous voice with fitting background instruments. She captures her feelings (both good and bad) and shares them with ease.
Great music highly recommended.  My favorite is her renditon of the Cure's Lovesong.This album is full of hit songs.
this is my favorite album of Adele. i'm enjoying every songs and i bought extra one for my family.if you love Adele song buy this!! you will enjoy it!
Every song is great to listen to and her voice is strong and powerful. Everyone will enjoy her music and talent
Adele is a respected musician in pop music lately especially since pop music is crap nowadays. There are a boatload of reviews of this CD that have a positive rating. However I am not one of those people. Adele is praised for working hard and not just popping out of the blue and making a garbagy song and peaking it at #1 like ridiculously garbagy artists like Katy Perry Lady Gaga Ke$ha Justin Bieber ETC. but I think this album is just whiny vocals (one thing in music I try to avoid) and misplaced lyrics. I also try to avoid seeing the ridiculously creepy album cover which shows a majority of her face. Rolling in the Deep is one of the worst songs ever. Overall I don't like Adele's music but she is praised by me for not being a complete gullible mess in the music industry.
I love Adele.  Her voice is so passionate and soulful.  Even if I  have never gone through the particular subject of one of her songs I feel like I can relate because of the emotion in her voice.  She's a spectacular artist.  One and Only is probably the one I play the most then Set Fire to the Rain.
I love the entire CD it is truly entertaining and amazing. I listen in the car and on my iPod at work. Adele's voice and the songs are soul touching. I just love it.
I love her music! The album is great! EVERY SINGLE SONG IS AMAZING!! The service was so fast and it was a great Christmas gift for my mother! She is so pleased! Thanks so much!
Adele has such true talent.  Her voice is deep and moving and REAL.  I hope she is around to make beautiful soulful music for many years to come.
I was an Adele fan for a moment with her first album but this album seems a bit much but still it is nice. A part of it seems to be a different style than what I originally know her for. Debating on if I will get the next album but I hope she remembers what she was known for in the beginning and resurfaces that style again.
once again ADELE doesn't disappoint. her voice is amazing and every song a treat!! ENJOY!! this cd spends a lot of time in my player!!!
Absolutely love!! Wonderful quality and such musical talent.Enjoyed the entire album.I would definitely recommend buying this album. You will enjoy it.
I bought this as a gift for my granddaughter who is a big Adele fan.  She loved the CD and I loved making her happy.
WHAT'S TO SAY ADELE IS FANTASTIC.  ONE CANNOT HELP ENJOY HER MUSIC.  SHE HAS QUITE A VOICE AND IS AN ENJOYING AUTHENTIC PERSONALITY ALSO.
To say i LOVE this cd would be an understatement.  Every single song is good.  I'm bummed adele cancelled her concert tour as i'm dying to see her live.  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
This is a great cd.  I turn up the volume in my car and rock on out with Adele as I drive through the countryside.
Adele's 21 is the best album that I have ever seen or heard in the past couple of years with the best selling album of both 2011 and 2012 that is still going strong with her voice look a goddess that sings to the amazingly beauty with its greatness and then some! BUY THIS ALBUM!
21 will without a doubt go down in history as one of the greatest albums of all time. It is so raw and powerful it leaves you completely speechless. Adele's lyrics are so pure and honest you can't help but relate to them. Anyone who's ever had a broken heart will benefit from this album because we've all been there. In denial in anger in desperation and finally in acceptance of the love that ended.I won't go on about each and every song cause they're all remarkable. There is not one single dud on this masterpiece the whole thing flows so incredibly smooth. Buy this album and support Adele if anyone deserves to be making music for the next 50 years It is this woman. With a voice sweet enough to melt you and powerful enough to strengthen you. An absolute knockout she is.My Favorite Songs1. Rolling In The Deep2. Set Fire To The Rain3. Don't You Remember4. Someone Like You5. Turning TablesALL THE SONGS ARE PHENOMENAL!
I LOVE ADELE SO MUCH SHE IS AN AMAZING SINGER AND SHE CAN MAKE YOU NOT WORRY OR THINK ABOUT ANYTHING WHEN YOU LISTEN TO HER MUSIC I SUGGEST THAT ANYONE SHOULD CHECK THIS ALBUM OUT EVEN IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOUL OR R&B.
Without a doubt the best purchase I've made at Amazon...Great CD great songs young and older people just love it...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I believe that in Brazil it's the same...everybody is just crazy about Adele...blessed voice!
No Amy Winehouse... no Adele. But at least Adele has her feet on the ground and likely to be around for awhile. The influence is obvious.
I bought it as a gift for a friend. He is extremly happy with it. I will shipped diferently next time to get it to me quicker.
This is one of very few albums I've heard lately on which EVERY SINGLE TRACK is worth listening to. The piano accompaniment the arrangements and the songwriting are all stellar. But the true star of this album is Adele's voice. Hearing her sing is like leaping from a cliff into a warm ocean. It terrifies and exhilarates at the same time. There is a sense of peace and tranqulity in the descending free fall and then a plunge into something wider deeper and more sublime than you have ever imagined. I completely agree with Beyonce listening to Adele is like hearing the voice of God.
I think Adele has a voice of an angel!  Had to have the album!The easy download made it so easy to get!
The songs the sound and just the vinyl made me go back to vinyl times. Its just perfect and sounds really well.
I bought this CD after hearing just a few of the hits from it. I listened to it from beginning to end there is not one song on it that I would 'delete'. Her voice is amazing and the lyrics can touch your soul.
I love Adele and this CD is fantastic!  I had purchased one over a year ago but either I misplaced it or it was borrowed and never returned.  That's probably what really happened; its so good they decided to keep it for themselves.  I reordered this recently and love love love her music.
I enjoy Adele's music. I love how soulful she makes her music and it is always a delight to listen to.
simply excellent...amazing voice...ideal for presents to those who do not know Adele yet...Her voice is quite something!It is a must have...
I have been looking for it cd for awhile but I have not found it at a price that I could afford until I got to amazon.  Great cd for great price.
Adele is amazing. I enjoy her voice no matter which song is playing. I have she a very long time at the top.
"Overproduced pop trash.  Run away.  Everything on this album is regrettable.  ""Someone Like You"" may be the worst song ever written and recorded."
What can I say she is the queen of contemporary music.  Actually we bought this album for friends in Istanbul.  Adele is a superstar worldwide.
Adele has a great voice as we all know by now and the things she sings about and the feeling she puts into her songs--this is really a great album that deserves all the accolades its been getting.
This cd is awesome! Jam out in the shower to it or in the car a very versatile cd and not all the songs are on the radio so it makes it more fun!
Adele has a spectacular voice. Nothing like anything else out there. She's in a class all by herself. I love jazz/blue has young vibrant energy. As you listen to the album you can feel the stages of grief and recovery she is going through after the heartache of the breakup that led to this album.
I love this cd. Her voice is awesome and all the songs are great! Now my mom wants to keep it in her car!
I really liked this CD.  I was never into bluesy music before Adele but this CD has something for everyone.  She really speaks to us with her soulfull voice.  Give this one a listen!
If you have 19 then you need 21!This is an awesome album. If you like the songs played on the radio you will love the entire disc.
Adele is amazing. This is one of the most soulful heartfelt and beautiful pieces of popular music you can buy. I really liked 19 however I totally was not expecting a classic like 21. Every single song on this cd is great and every time I listen I can't help but get goosebumps from her voice. Its been a few months since I purchased 21 and I am still listening to it on a regular basis. Another must purchase for all music fans out there! Honest!
Finally bought this as I believe Adele has such a truely &#34;big voice&#34;. One or two arrangements I'd like to hear redone.
I am the very last person in the world to hear Adele so I ordered this for myself. It arrived quickly and in good condition and shall be enjoyed.
Adele is a great musician.  Her music is so powerful. This CD has so many songs and each one is great. I hate buying CDs and only liking one or two songs. I like this entire CD and so will you.
YOU ARE TRULY BLESSED BABY GIRL!  I PRAY FOR GODS' CONTINUED BLESSINGS IN YOUR LIFE AND FAMILY!  I ENJOY EVERY SONG ON MY CD!
THIS CD IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE CDS I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. I LISTEN TO IT ALL THE TIME. I LOVE IT. LORI E FROM TEXAS
Hadn't heard some of the songs. Not all are great but what she does is unique sounding and worth the time to listen
The songs are beautiful and Adele is a great artist.  Downloading the album however was not a pleasant experience.  For those people that normally download music from Amazon probably is not an issue for them.  Overall I would reccomend the Album.
I have always loved Adele but found this album somewhat boring to the extent that I haven't even listened to the entire album.  Maybe it just takes some familiarity to the songs..in time?
Love her voice love this cd
Very happy with my purchase.  Brand new CD at a great price!  Will definitely shop Amazon again as I have in the past.  Thanks.
"It seems rather ridiculous to write a review for an artist as famous as Adele but perhaps there are guys that might find this worthwhile.  I am a Rolling Stones Led Zepplin Tom Petty Neil Young the Offspring Black Keys kind of guy.  My wife wanted me to listen to this.  Roll the eyes. But you know there are other voices and songs and musicality that ring true as well.  Linda Ronstadt singing ""Blue Bayou"" Janis The Wilson sisters singing ""Magic  Man"" Sheryl Crow and ""Strong Enough (to be My Man).""  If you liked any of these then buy this CD and sit back 'n listen.  I don't think you will regret it."
I have been a fan from the first time I heard Adele sing ran out & bought her 1st CD( 19 ) enjoy it so much still.. but ordered this particular CD ( ADELE 21 )from Amazon as a 20th Birthday gift for my daughter in N C We are totally in love again with this newest one  so happy to have a Company like Amazon that gives one the option to sent something as a gift even saved some money = ) Thank You so much Amazon!!a Loyal fan is Sioux Falls SD....
Every song gives me goosebumps. Her voice is refreshing. Will continue to buy as many albums as she will put out.
The GOOD songs were great the rest are s0-s0 and I removed them from my computer. I could have saved myself $5.00 by just buying the particular songs. I REALLY like Adele's popular songs but the rest of the CD was disappointing all things considered.
Just discovered Adele for myself last year and truly amazed at this lady's vocal range!  A must have for lovers of those women that can really belt it out from the heart and soul.
What can I say that has not been said already? Adele is unique; a voice for the ages. No one compares or is remotely near her range of voice and depth of emotion.
I personally like Adele's voice with the more upbeat songs she sings however having said that she can sing anything.  This album is a total joy with every song having something to recommend it.  There is emotion understanding and true love of music that comes through with each song.  I have my favorites of course but the album as a whole is worthy of listening to and learning each and every song.  Normally I decline purchasing whole albums simply because there are usually 2-3 maybe 4 songs that I really like and the rest is a waste.  With Adele there is no waste.  It's all musically beautiful.
I have truly enjoyed this new cd Adele has such a strong and powerful voice.  The songs on the album are all wonderful and it is a pleasure to sit back and enjoy!
Best music I've ever heard!  Listen to it all the time!  I want to buy more of her tapes when my bills are paid for Christmas!
Adele has a great voice and this is a great CD.I like all the songs and it puts me in a good mood.
I don't normally listen to pop at all or easy listening really but Adele's voice is so unique and there are a lot of good lyrics on this album.  I love it!
Me and my boyfriend love this new CD we got it a month ago and haven't stopped listening to it yet. Everyday we play it in the Bose Stereo along with another top of the line artist. Everyone should give this album a go. Especially if U like real good love songs. Not the ones of long ago that were a little lame.
Love Adele and the softness she brings to her music.I listen to her when I am looking for music that calms me and brings happy thoughts.
Just love Adeleanything she sings is always very great. Will probably get more of her music at a later date.
The CD is monotonous -- not too much diversion in sound.  Might need to look at another Adele CD at a later time.
Beautiful voice.  I have this CD in my car and play it over and over.  I will continue to buy her CD's.
To say the truth I had no idea of who she is on the cover of the CD and what kind of songs she sings. The reason I bought it just because of adding the amount of money required by Free two day delivering. But as soon as I listen to it I am absorbed into its melody. How beautiful those songs are especially Rolling in the Deep Don't You Remember Set Fire to the Rain and Someone Like You! How unique the sound is but how appropriate it is to those love blue songs. I quickly search the web for any information about the pop singer Adele Adkins. For me the day I received the CD is worthy of remembering. I highly recommend this CD.
Adele is my new fav singer.  I love her beaty songs and the lyrics are so very life lessons.  She is cool in a new way.  Love how she drops off the first letter on some words like Love she says ove.  Listen to her she does it to lots of other words.
Just had to have it and now I am glad I do it is just wonderful experience to listen too!
Love this CD!  I felt the price was fair and I received the CD quickly. I appreciated being able to order it online instead of shopping for it in stores.
"I caught the acoustic version of ""Rolling in the Deep"" on VH1 and that video stayed in my head until I could get home to buy the MP3 album. Needless to say it's been two weeks and this album hasn't been out of play. So many others have said it better on here but this is an amazing album. I have a new favorite every day (today it's ""Set Fire to the Rain"") and each new listen reveals a little bit more into this thoroughly genuine artist."
Her music is repetive... BUT our fave song is set fire to the rain. and thats seems to be the best song ever from her!!!
I was a bit disconserted because when I played it on my computer there were chinese-like hieroglyphics for the CD information. The same thing when I ripped it to the computer. Song names were not in English. Fortunately the casing info was in English. I would not have knowingly purchased this product as is. Product itself was very good.
I rarely purchase CD's anymore. Downloads are fine for me. I treasure this one. It will be worn out from replay soon. I can't wait for the next one.
Every song speaks to my heart. This cd is a classic and one that will be forever on my playlist!
This is a good moody cd. I absolutely adore her voice and this album is the same powerful voice and catchy yet moody lyrics. Buy it and you wont be sorry.
Everyone knows about this album so there is not much to be added.  A powerful voice with lyrics to match.
I love Adele and her music and love all the songs on this CD. I ordered a new one. But after opening I don't think this CD is new. It was not sealed although it was in plastic wrap. I am going to exchange it for a new one. That's what I paid for. Not used! and also I can tell it been played before because there is a slight crackle in the background and it's not my speakers.
Thoroughly enjoying this CD. Adele's voice and music is amazing. Two of her most popular songs are on this CD...Rolling in the Deep and Turning Tables. From ballads to more up tempo really good!
Bought this for my mom for mother's day as this is what she wanted. She has played it and played it. She loves it. It made for a Happy Mother's Day!
I love her.  Have the cd for the car but needed her on the kindle for travel.  buy it for yourself
Adele has been one of my favorites this CD is intoxicating. She is singing from her heart you can feel it hear it in her voice and her words. She is a true talent beautiful inside and out!
I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SELF  I LOVE ADELE  SHE HAS A BEAUTIFUL VOICE AND IS A WONDERFUL ARTIST. BUT AS FOR AS MY OPINION HER CD  21 IS FRO AS ONE OF THE BEST
Loved the CD and the fact that I could down load it great CD GREAT CD great CD great CD just filling in words because it will not let me submit without more words.
I can't stop listening to this cd. Adele's voice is hauntingly beautiful. You will not be disappointed if you get it.
Such a great talent. I was surprised when I listened to it the first time. If all of her music continues like this I  will always be a fan.
I like the way Adele perform the songs. Also this album contains many awesome tracks.The quality of the mp3 are great.
Adele is a musical genius. This entire album is a joy !!!She is rare talent that is a long time coming and hopefullywill continue on even longer.
I usually listen to music from the 60s and 70s and ignore today's charts. But when I heard some cuts from this album on Youtube I decided to buy it. It far exceeded my expectations. I can listen to this album over and over again. It's so far from the autotune popstar fake music of today. Often just her voice piano and strings this album is full of raw emotion and music. You can connect to it. You can feel her pain about her breakup and share that journey with her until she finally comes to terms with it in the end. Excellent album.
Each song is better than the next. You can hear from the start she honestly put her heart and soul in to this project. And the results speak for themselves!
My first Adele CD and I am not disappointed! What a beautiful soulfull voice!  I will definitely buy her next album
This CD has been around for awhile but I just purchased it; stupid me! It is wonderful as we all know!
This is a great CD! Adele has a rich clear voice that's also strong and interesting. Very happy with this purchase!
It is so nice to hear new artists with some real talent singing a type of music I can relate to. Shear joy. Hope she does more after settling in with her new baby.
adele music is amazing she is a really great singrr and her songs are amazingI love the way her words come together and what they mean.
What can I say...I became attached to Adele's music after hearing Rolling in the Deep! Now I'm hooked on Skyfall the music and the movie!
How could you go wrong with anything by Adele?  This CD is absolutely fabulous....Love it.  Play it all the time.
No disappointment here.  This is true Adele and I love it.  The songs are great--one after the other.  Going to get more Adele.
This album is simply amazing but don't pay $34.99 for the deluxe edition!  It's $11.99 at Target!  It's 4 extra tracks on a separate disc the exact same ones as listed here.  You may even find it cheaper I got it on sale for $9.99 - I don't know if it will go on sale again or not.
i love her music  she has such a beautiful voice .  i had been wanting the cd for awhile .
Totally love her music.  Listen to Adele all the time.  Will be purchasing more of her work.  Very talented lady.
Love it.  Play it all the time.  Has a lot of her hits and new songs are great too.  Would recommend it.
really loved this cd this was first adele cd and was completely surprised by the range of her voice. great cd
Adele is honest and purposeful in this second album.  She has matured as an artist and I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.
I thought I would give this a try for my first Adele CD but was not a fan. I only knew one song and I can hear that on the radio.
"This album is amazing as is Adele.  Great music - great lyrics.  If you have yet to hear her sing start with this Album - ""21"".  You will definitely be a fan after listening to this particular album.  I would recommend it to people of all ages - she definitely has a universal appeal - and buying from Amazon.com is the easiest way to get anything and everything you need."
I enjoyed this album. Adele's voice and lyrics are heartfelt and the varied tempos keep the musical interest. I would highly recommend!
If you're new to Adele you may be wondering which cd to buy.Recently traveling overseas in the UK and Ireland every house I visited seemed to have an Adele cd usually belonging to a teenage girl or young lady. When I inquired further nobody had anything but good to say about her. Even parents like her.Upon my return I bought 21 never having listened to an Adele song. By the time I got home from the record store I had listened to most of the album and immediately ordered her other album 19.On youtube you may discover a Saturday night live skit about her song Someone Like you where cast members broke into tears when they heard this song. So later when I watched her on video I had quite a strong emotional reaction to it which is unusual.If one talks about Adele either a flattering comparative or a superlative might be in order.Not since the Beatles has an artist had two top five singles and albums in the UK charts simultaneously. Not since Madonna has a female artist held the number one position in the charts for 12 weeks consecutively before Adele with 21. In the Uk it's the bestselling album of the century so far beating Amy Winehouse's Back to Black. Six million recoreds sold in the USA in 2011  231 million views of Rolling in the Deep on youtube. Her previous album 19 sold more than 5 million copies. She has sold more than 4.1 million copies of 21 in Britain alone.  Now she has 6 grammy nominations winning 6 including Song of the Year for Rolling in the Deep and Best Album for 21.Called 21 because that's how old she was when she wrote it. Several songs including Someone Like You and Turn The Tables are relationship driven pieces inspired by an ex boyfriend who broke her heart and inspired her art. The major hits are Someone Like You and Rolling in the deep although I find all the songs to be high quality. I have been listening to this album in the car and only this album for about two weeks and never pressed the skip button once.In interviews refreshing and down to earth. Asked on Chelsea Lately about her ex boyfriend she said: 'I believe he's living in a shabby apartment in London. I am staying in a very nice hotel around the corner.'Rarely have I experienced a singer who grabs your nervous system and drags you into her emotional world. At once she manages to sound both modern and retro. This album is very well produced and in addition to her voice we have great instrumentation with catchy piano fills and intriguing backing vocals from female singers even a brass section on some tracks. If she reminds me of anyone it's Dusty Springfield Son of a Preacher Man but she is distinctly Adele..My only concern for Adele is her vocal issues surgery with bleeding vocal cords canceling her American tour. Having undertaken vocal training for several years I know of several great singers who have lost their voices through flawed technique or overdoing it the obvious example being Julie Andrews so she needs to follow a proven successful method adopted by many successful singers such as the speech level singing method which will protect and nurture her voice. It would be a tragedy if someone as talented as Adele was lost ot the world because of what would be preventable issues.If you are wondering whether 19 or 21 is better get 21 first. Her voice is better. The song quality is better overall the production values are superior. On 21 all the songs are good and some of the songs are great. Not to say that 19 is not good just that 21 is better. I love the energy of Rumor Has It and also Turn The Tables and Someone Like You is an iconic relatable anthem to lost love. I also love Rolling in the deep.One thing that intrigues me about her songwriting is her figures of speech whether it is the metaphor of turning the tables or can you imagine what it's like to chase pavements and can you really hit someone with your cold shoulder?I think you will enjoy it and I hope this was helpful.
I know others have given this CD in-depth reviews so I will simply say it's awesome and you should buy it.
obviously she's a hit.  her voice is great.  i find some of the tracks a little slow and can narrow down my favorites to a hand-full but this album was worth the purchase.
I love this album.  Adele is a very talented young singer and writer.  She has an excellent voice.  Some of her songs are very reflective of her own heartbreak and it gives those of us who have also experienced heartbreak to do the same.  For me it was a healing process that has enabled me to move on. That's her message.
"God but I do not know where to begin when describing Adele's new album ""21""...I do remember seeing her for the first time in Q magazine.....I believe Madonna was on the cover promoting her brilliant ""Hard Candy"" album and I opened to the second page and saw those haunting eyes and expression on this beautiful face and thought that this was someone very special....and then I purchased ""19"" and was struck by a totally original and beautifully expressive voice the likes I have not heard in many a year.Adele's newest album builds on her first success by leaps and bounds and constitutes quite an achievement for one so young.  I hear many influences the most direct to my ears being the great Dusty but listen and you will hear traces of Aretha Janis Billie and even in terms of truth and soul Garland and Piaf....all the while being a totally individual and brilliant talent all her own.  Nobody sounds like Adele today and when you hear her you instantly know who this voice belongs to.  This ain't no media pushing commercial pulp!!!Listen in particular to Take It All Set Fire To the Rain Turning Tables Lovesong Rumour Has It and the sublime Someone Like you and you will hear a voice and artistry that will be in it for the long long long run....please Adele don't prove me wrong!!!!!Luigi ~ NYC"
Adele has music and I can't say that for every artist with a good voice. She is soulful fun and strong on this album. At times there's a bit of similarity to the first album yet at the same time an ability to show growth. I thoroughly enjoy listening. The first song grabs me but there are others that relax me. She's not afraid to be classic either. It troubles me that so many so-called artists are viewed as soulful or artsy and put out the same stuff and then Adele puts out this album and gets limited airplay here in the states...
Still have the CD in my car and play it everytime I get in my car very talented woman congrats on the baby
wonderful lyrics strong voice & melody to die for!! was not disappointed! Adele has a bright future ahead of her. Amazon has delivered again!  Love them!!!
ADELE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A FAV OF MINE...SHE HAS A VOICE I ONLY WISH I HAD AND THE HEART I KNOW I HAVE....SHE BRINGS ME AROUND WHEN MY SADNESS DROPS IN...BUT THIS COMPLETE CD IS AWESOME...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!!!!!!!
She is fabulous!!!The cd is perfect!!!All the songs are great!!!!I love Adele...Thanks.Luis - Piracicaba - SP - Piracicaba - Brazil.
"Like Joni Mitchell Aretha Franklin and Carole King before her Adele has delivered an album that is classic and iconic with '21'. Infused with elements of gospel blues & soul the album is a breath of fresh air in the current musical landscape that is oversaturated with party rump-shaking songs that say a whole lot of nothing.'21' showcases Adele as a woman of many dimensions. In one moment she displays wide-eyed wisdom and strength as on the driving ""Rolling In The Deep"" and then she exudes a frightening and real vulnerability as on ""Take It All"". Then there is even a hybrid of both strength and vulnerability as on ""Set Fire To The Rain"". If you haven't seen her sing ""Someone Like You"" on stage get thee to YouTube immediately. The 2011 BRIT Awards performance is particularly emotional. While there are no best songs on the CD (each stands as a classic on its own) I connect most strongly with ""Turning Tables"". One thing is certain: she is aware where she is emotionally and shares it through a wide range of incredible music for our benefit.In the mid to late 90s there was a wave of outstanding albums delivered by some incredible artists - Sarah McLachlan's Surfacing Lauryn Hill's The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill and Alanis Morrisette's Jagged Little Pill. I hope Adele's '21' ushers in another wave of good music even if the other artists don't quite reach the heights of this particular release. Unlike many of today's female artists whose music is secondary to their image Adele uncovers and bares her soul on '21' an album that will be remembered as one of the greatest albums this decade. It's one of my favorites of all-time."
She has a great voice and style.  Wonderful arrangements.  Almost every song is wonderful to listen to time and again.  One of my favorites.
I loved the first two songs on Adele's 21 album but sadly did not like the remaining ones.  They did not measure up to the quality of the first. If I had to purchase it over again I wouldn't!
In addition to the popular tunes you hear over and over on the radio the rest of the selections are very good too.
"Adele's 21 album is definitely hyped; and I even fell for the hype. I found out about Adele when I heard her singing ""rolling in the deep"" and her remix of ""rumor has it"" ft Lindsay Lohan (Don't judge; it was a really good remix). I thought she was great and I was totally set on getting her album BUT after listening to amazon's music samples I felt it (the album) didn't live up to my expectations. I read the reviews everyone said it was an awesome album but I decided not to get it...until today. I heard the full version of ""rumor has it"" via youtube and I was like ""wow this is amazing."" I bought the album via digitial download and I'm so glad I did. The sample music really doesn't do her justice at all. Alot of the songs are packed with emotions and you can really feel her words. It's a bit of country and some r&b; that's the vibe I got from listening. I highly recommend it. The media hype is for realz."
Adele is amazing and there is a good mixture of different sounds and tempos so it's not monotonous.  It has all of my favorite songs as well.  Love it!
I guess I expected to be totally blown away but I did enjoy most songs. Her voice is pure magic!
Adele has a great voice and her songs are contemporary.  I predict she will be a top artist very quickly.  The CD was nicely packaged and arrived in mint condition.
I love Adele's music but the cd had a visible dimple at the end of it therefore messing up the last song. Not worth the trouble to return it.
This album is awsom! All songs are great as well as ADELE voice is out of this world!!  Can't wait for the next album
Adele is a flawless singer and her voice transports you to a happy place in your mind and feels great
What more can I say.  Adele's voice is simply magnificent.  I held off buying it because of the rush when she first came out with this album but it was worth the wait.  Love her voice.
The songs were very pleasing and Adele has great lyrics. Adele has a wonderful range and perfect pitch.  I might want to purchase more of her music in the future.
Great if you're bitter or betrayed. Very empowering. Wish I had it during my breakup. Now...not so much. One of the best in my opinion. Her voice is outstanding. Looking forward to 22!
"Adele's 19 was strong. 21 is simply timeless.In the past two years Adele has refined and reinvented her unique sound that always puts her aching yet powerful vocals and lyrics at the forefront. These are songs that could have been released in the 60s as easily as 30 years from now. Adele has injected her trademark piano ballads with the best from several different musical genres including Americana roots and country r&b; blues and gospel. The music is exciting and simply is. It lives breathes.There are a few tracks towards the middle that are remarkable only because Adele sings them-- and while they aren't quite filler they aren't as memorable as standout tracks like ""Rolling in the Deep"" ""Set Fire to the Rain"" ""Someone Like You"" and ""Turning Tables."" Adele set the bar so high with these songs that anything else short of magic is sort of a letdown. However as a whole--this album so involves you that you can feel these stories as your own.I played a couple songs for my mom who at forty years older than I generally criticizes my music taste and the first thing she said was ""Wow this girl really knows how to write a story--those songs are beautiful.""21 is haunting pulsing soaring and very intimate.  It's music that will be remembered."
She is very talented don't get me wrong. But I will say I am not exactly sure what all the hype is about. Bought the cd and I just don't get it.
A big fan of Adele's voice.This CD is one to add to your collection. It covers all emotions as she is so talented
ADELE DOS SOMETHING WITH HER MUSIC AND GETS INSIDE YOUR HEAD OR SOUL AND MAKE YOU FEEL SOMETING EVEN IF YOU THINK YOU ARE DEAD INSIDE TERSA
"The truth is: people only like Adele because she is overweight. That is the gosh-darn truth! Teens think they are listening to high-brow mature music just because Adele doesn't look like a stereotypical female pop singer. I have heard fans boasting ""Oh I listen to Adele""...like it some academic achievement that should be admired. There is a touch of snobbery about Adele fans.It is now not ""cool"" to be a thin blonde female singer! Society has gone topsy-turvy! Thin female popstars are considered trashy...yet overweight female popstars are considered ""Real Women"" who sing deep/meaningful songs! Bizarre...EDIT: People saying ""You haven't listened to the album"" are wrong! I have!I appreciate melancholic ballads (I am a massive Karen Carpenter fan) but Adele is too depressing for my tastes. I just want to shake her and say: ""Cheer up honey! It's not that bad! People are dying in Africa yet you were a millionaire by the time you were 20!"".Sure Adele can belt out a song...but can she sing? Shouting does NOT equal singing! There is a difference! PLEASE LISTEN TO THE BRITISH SINGER ""RUMER"" TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SINGING AND SHOUTING! She can really sing!"
I listen every day to this cd it has not once skipped! It's my favorite cd and I love her so much my kids sing along in the car we love Adele thanks for the great deal! It shipped fast and has not left my cd player in my car since!
I like about 50% of the songs on this album.  I bought it because of &#34;Rumor Has It&#34; and &#34;Rolling In the Deep&#34; but other than a couple more songs I really don't listen to the whole album.  Just wondered what the &#34;fuss&#34; was about.  She has a lovely voice and her music is crisp but unless you're a big fan just &#34;download&#34; the two songs you REALLY want to hear.  :(
Rollin' in the deep is great- not thrilled about the rest. She had a lot of fun- or sounds it- in RITD but the rest didn't sound that way.
What can you say about Adele. Her voice is amazing her lyrics touch your heart and I feel that she appeals to all adult age groups.Not many people as talented as she
It's very rare for an artist to come out with an album that impacts you through lyrics AND music ... Adele has accomplished this.  I love every song on this cd and would recommend this to everyone.
"Love this CD 21 by Adele! Bought it specifically for the song ""Rolling in the deep"" and was blown away by the rest of the CD awsome vocalist and song writer. And it arrived before due date... :)"
Maybe i was expecting another 19 that i liked from beginning to end. This one there are some tracks that i press skip to avoid.
I really respect and admire Adele's talent and her powerful vocals.  However when I've listened to this repeatedly I find that she sometimes sounds whiny.  I just have to take listening to the CD in small doses (not repeatedly on long car trips).
Saw Adele on the awards show and fell in love with her. This cd is full of great hits. Not a bad song on it!
Exceeded my expectations!  All of the songs on this CD are great!  The song Rumors was the reason I bought the CD...the rest of the songs are great too!
I am Hooked and hope she will do many more CDs. Her voice is so very unique. By buying the CD you support Adele to do more music.  Also watch Adele on YOUTUBE may change you mind if you are not sure.
WOW.....Fantastic.  Adele's voice is insane.  She really can sing.  We need more like her.  This is an album to check out if you love a good soulful and huge voice.  This album is as pleasing if not more pleasing than her first album.  I can't honestly not pick which album that I like better both are oh so good.  Both are pleasing to my ears.  She doesn't sound 21 at all.  She is very wise for a 21 year old she must be an old soul.  Check this girl out.  WOW!!!!
Liked even the songs I had never heard before--rarely do I buy a CD and like every song but I do on this one.  Might get some of her earlier music also.
Adele has created a rich deeply emotional piece of music and her voice is incredible! I just love her crisp sultry heartfelt vocals. She rocks!
Adele is an amazing talent.  Hope she makes some more music soon!  I doubt I will ever tire of her.
There is two good songs that I likevery good songs .unfortnally the other songs Ididn't care for.but the two songs makes the cd worth buying.
This woman is so talented.  The CD is very impressive with the lyrics and music.  We heard some of her songs on the radio but we knew we had to have this CD to hear ALL her songs.  Will be enjoyable to listen to for years and years.
This is a great CD. Her style is fresh and new. Love the lyrics and music. I would recommend this CD.
Amazed she wrote these songs at 21.  Love the diversity of the songs and am totally enjoying her voice.  She seems to be a natural.
I bought this album a couple months ago and still listen to it on a regular basis and many of the songs over and over.  Love it!
Rolling in the Deep Set fire to the Rain and Someone like You are my favorite songs onthis album. Adele has such an amazingly beautiful voice!!!
Adele's CD is amazing.  I could listen to every song on the CD over and over.  My niece wanted it and bought a copy for her too.
"I had heard of Adele but hadn't actually listened to her until someone practically forced me to watch her Brit Awards performance this year of ""Someone Like You."" It was a mesmerizing performance. So right afterwards I listened to my friend's CD and fell in love with it. This album is quite unlike her debut effort and thankfully so as I did not enjoy her debut album 19 at all.The first thing I wanted to do after listening to the album for the first time in its entirity was to #1 listen to it again and #2 go out and buy it which I did in that order. Adele is unique. 21 is a great but not perfect album hence I gave it 4 stars. What sets Adele apart from her peers are her vocals. People don't pay money to go see Adele sing to watch her gyrate in her underwear like other female artists. Adele isn't about dancing to jingles. She's got a lovely voice and is precisely what the music industry needs more of. While she doesn't have the range or depth of an Alice Smith she does have plenty of range and Adele knows how to use her voice to convey emotion.21 has a country feel so it's surprising that I love it as much as I do. I suppose I enjoy country when it's not served in copious amounts. The track that gets the most play on my iPod is ""Set Fire to the Rain"" which has classic written all over it. Perhaps there's a bit too much instrumentation but it never eclipses the quality of her voice. The song is very emotional. Other stand out tracks are ""Rumor Has It"" ""I'll Be Waiting"" and ""Rolling in the Deep."" I do love ""Someone Like You"" however the album version is not a rendition I ever listen to. Her LIVE version at the 2011 Brit Awards will probably never be bested so that's the version I listen to can't stand the album version to be honest."
Great CD.
this is a much better album and has nice song on here.i just love her voice in this album.i love it
Beautiful voice..beautiful music...I am very happy with my Adele 21. I play whenever I am in the car thank you Amazon!
I really only bought it for a couple of tracks but suprised that I like all tracks. She has an unige voice.
"If YOU love beyond-outstanding vocals and stunning music arrangement I am confident that you'll love... ""Rolling In The Deep"" ""Rumour Has It"" and ""Set Fire To The Rain"" These are my 3 favorite songs on this disc. This CD has NO weak songs ...but it's hard to NOT have favorites and these are mine.I have not been this excited about an artist as my recent discovery of Tonya Watts. This joins the company of my favorite discoveries of Patty Griffin Kasey Chambers Judas Priest and the Gear Daddies."
Another gift for Tresa which she loves adeles voice and I have to say she is an awesome singerThanks for the sounds.
"Recently held a surprise ""50th"" birthday for my sister...played ""Adele 21"" and everyone enjoyed it even grandma.  Hope she has a fantastic career with many more popular CD's."
So much easier to use Amazon for music.  I can preview the songs.  I don't have to go to a store and search through to find the CD I think I am looking for.  Delivery was fast.
Love her singing ...................I can only hope .....that she does not loose her beautiful voice again!  That would be very sad!
My CD arrived with a broken case so I found it disappointing.  It did arrive in timely fashion and the CD itself was fine.
Lost the first CD and had to buy another. A great set of songs that I listen to whenever I need to sing.
"I bought another CD and this one was on the ""other people bought"" list so I took a chance and it paid off.  Great CD!"
Adele has the talent that so many other big name pop artists lack.  She can take any style of music from any time period embrace it and release a hit.  Her first album bought me as a lifetime fan and this album takes just as many risks and still comes out on top.  Adele has a sound that should be heard by all.
I'm a senior citizen who loves Adele's talent !  I listen to this with my grand daughters ! GREAT cd !
When you hear Adele on this album you understand what talent is. This is a gifted woman and I can see her having a monster career for years to come. I was very happy to see she won the grammy last year and seeing her this year on the grammys - ugly dress and all - I had to smile. She's warm real appreciates her fans and fellow performers and ontop of everything else seems to be a genuinely nice person. It doesn't get better than that.
Again well worth the wait!!!!!  What a great CD!  The lady deserves the awards that she won!  thanks again!
Adele's music is fabulous.  I have had this CD for almost a year now and I never tire of her music!
"My favorite song for the year was the free Amazon giveaway of Adele's ""Someone Like You"" the ACOUSTIC version. Just her and her piano. It was only in the free album section for a day or so. It's somewhat distorted (like it was recorded with the volume too high). I wish they sold it. It's really pretty.If anyone knows where to get it post it."
I enjoy listening to this talented young women. Most of the songs are good a few self indulgent but that is OK the rest were what I expect from her..
One cannot say enough about Adele her voice her style her writing of lyrics. She touches the soul. Love the CD Adele 21. Love Adele and will continue to support her.
Yes Adele has many years ahead of her; however no she's not the soulful Amy Winehouse Etta James or the crooners Frank Dean or Tony; She is good and will mature but not my cup of tea. We'll see what the future holds.
What can I say about this; who doesn't like Adele?  This &#34;21&#34; is a great album with many beautiful songs..
Fast shippingsecure packaging and wonderful selection of songs.This girl is a total Brit songbird!Love Love Love her voice soul and lyrics!Such talent!
I love this CD the sound is like being in concert.!  I will be ordering more of the same this is a good CD
The inside of the cd case  was broke so the the cd won't stay put inside the case. Not happy about that.
Also recommended by a friend and I really liked my first CD so I purchased another one. She has a unique style and sound.
I like this song and would recommend it for everyone. Buy it and enjoy for yourself. It is a good one.
Song selection was well done thank you.  The older crowd is able to understand the lyrics which is such a relief.
I finally purchased this CD.  I love every song on it and now can listen to it while I am driving.  Wish I had purchased it earlier.  Every song on the CD is a hit.  Her voice is just outstanding.
Definitely her best production. I often listen to the CD in my car. Excellent sound quality. Her best production. No problems with the CD until now.
Love it! Adele is beautiful and a soulful singer. I am happy I now own a copy of her CD.
Great CD! One of the favorites listened to on a 12 hour trip in the car. So emotional and relatable to everyone!
I have really enjoyed this CD.  Adele has a sound all her own and the lyrics are just great on all the songs.  Took me a few times to understand each word as her English accent does come through at times.  But for me it is a great CD that I have listened to many time and will continue to listen to.
This is the best album I have heard in a long time.  Adele has such a sultry voice.  The lyrics really hit home.  Recommend highly.
Adele is an amazing singer!I couldn't wait to get my hands on her cd.Perfect for listening while driving
Don't have enough time to listen to the CD but I love to listen to it when I do.  Love the songs on this CD.
This cd was surprisingly soulful original and emotional. There is not one selection that I did not like. Often one buys a cd and half or more of the selections are not good. This cd has me wanting more of this talented and insightful artist. The music is very good and the sound is clear and crisp. Looking to purchase another.
This album is amazing. In my opinion Adele is the next Diva with a voice. You won't regret this purchase.
I saw Adele's 2011 Brit Awards performance of 'Someone Like You' and her music video for 'Rolling In The Deep' and was completely blown away.So I decided to purchase her cd...I do not regret one moment purchasing this cd. Unbelievable!!!I love all 11 tracks on the cd and have listened to this cd countless times - beginning to end - from the moment I got it.Just completely amazing and beautiful.What more can I say - can't say enough!
GREAT MUSIC BY A GREAT ARTIST AT A GREAT PRICE!  HE IS THRILLED TO BE ABLE TO LISTEN TO IT ANY TIME HE WISHES!
Adele is sucha beautiful artist and this cd surely proves that. You will love these songs after you listen to them once or twice....you will be singing right along from the start.
Adele has real musical talent in every sense of the word. 21 is proof! I can listen to it over and over again....love it!!
Wonderful CD. It has all of the classic songs Adele is known for. Terrific quality. I've played it over and over and never tire of listening to it. Highly recommend!
I can't believe Adele was only 21 years old when she made this album! In my opinion every song on the album is a winner and beautifully produced as well.  Was amazed at the warmth and depth of the sound quality of this CD which I believe is missing from much of current digitally produced music.  Appreciated the fast shippingalso. Thanks Amazon!
I love love love her first disc and was so excited to know this one was coming out and I cannot believe that I actually love this one even more! Truly amazing voice and moving songs. Well done!
If you are tired of computer enhanced voices jamming the airwaves this is one CD to own.  Adele's voice is beautiful true and touches your soul.  I loved her first CD (Adele 19) and thought it would be tough to top but this CD surpassed my expectations.  It's hard to believe she is only 21 yrs. old! Sit back with a nice glass of wine and just revel in the beauty of her voice and the stories she so eloquently tells through it.
lifts me up in life when i listen to this cd.she puts her heart in to her music speaks of life we go through life in today world.
Adele's voice is quite simply a gift from God.  Became a fan within seconds of hearing one of her songs for first time - Rolling In The Deep.
Adele is so talented. Each one of her songs are amazing; I'm so glad she is now on the radio.
Its Adele need I say more?Love her music and her voice. SHe is def. one of my favorite artists. Thanks
How can you not love adele.  the cd came in great condition and I love her music she is the best.
"One of the best CD's I've heard in a long time.  Adele's voice is just haunting especially in ""Rolling in the Deep"""
I bought this CD for my 5 daughters and myself. We finally have found a CD that we ALL like; which is very hard to do. I would recommend this CD to anyone and everyone.
Love her voice. This is a great CD. I really  like all the songs on it which is a plus.
No painstakingly produced flashy stage show could ever take the place of what really matters when listening to music: Talent.Adele has more talent in the twinkle of her eye than the likes of Nicky Minaj Sleigh Bells and Rihanna put together on top of a Celine Dion cake. The additional selling point that puts me over the top with her is that she doesn't have to be anything but Adele. Play music hear her sing feel her breathe. Done.Don't know if she can ever match the haunting beauty and production of 21 but I'm definitely gonna stay the course with her and figure it out.Thank you Adele... at least I know quality hasn't been totally lost to hype.
"This album is incredible. It's even better than Adele's ""19"" album which is saying a lot because that album rocked. Yes ""Rolling in the Deep"" is a fabulous song but it's not my favorite song on this CD by a long shot. Every single track on this album is fabulous and single-worthy. However I think my favorites are ""Lovesong"" which is a super sexy and seductive number and ""Someone Like You"" which is amazing and soulful and heart-wrenching...anyone who has ever loved and lost will totally be able to relate to this song. ""21"" is my favorite album of 2011 so far. Get yourself a copy now!"
I love Adele. She has an amazing voice. I would definetly buy more of her cds. My favorite songs are Rolling in the Deep Turning Tables and Someone Like You.
I've heard Adele for a few years but never really thought about getting her CD. But once I did I fell even more in love with her. I was originally drawn in from her first CD 19 which had songs on it I didn't realize she sung. This CD 21 is no exception.Rolling in the Deep starts the CD out with a powerful energetic song making everyone sing along. The power behind her voice is amazing and she's not shy to belt it out.Rumour Has It is the next track which is a catchy song. I was indifferent the first time I listened to it and now I can't stop listening to it.Turning Tables is a bit slower but it's one of my favorites on the CD. I've been addicted to this song since I've heard it. (The same with Rolling in the Deep) It's so powerful though it's slower.Someone Like You is the ending song and it's a good way to end the CD. It's powerful soft beautiful and amazing all wrapped in one.The other songs I don't mind too much but these are more of my favorite songs. The first time you listen to the CD you might skip a few songs but it's worth a second listen. That's what happened with me. Though I love Adele some of her songs were a bit slower for me and I wasn't in the mood at the time to listen to them. Some of them are more of a coffee house or jazz feel to them. But overall I love this CD. I would recommend it to anyone.
Love just about every song on this album and have been unable to get the songs out of my head (lol).  Thank you Adele for rocking it out and singing your heart out in such a beautiful way.  God bless! :0)
I love Adele so this purchase was wonderful.  I know most people know of 2 songs from this cd on the radio... But the entire cd is great.  I pity the fool that broke up with her because it gave her a lot to write about.  :-)
"It's true! I have purchased thousands of dollars worth of products from Amazon but have never been inspired to write a review. Until now.I don't know what Adele's vocal background is (I'll look up her bio eventually) but whatever it may be it is varied in terms of pronunciation of words and creative use of the staccato (a form of musical articulation signifying an unconnected note which is separated or detached from its neighbors by a silence).""Chasing Pavements"" was her first U.S. chart and my introduction to Adele. Although I was not knocked out of my socks by the song it inspired me to look forward to more. But still have not heard another track from the ""19"" album.But ""21""'s ""Somebody Like You"" which I first heard on the VH1 Unplugged she did was a haunting emotional and (if I may say) downright sexy song. Way too good of a tune to discourage me from believing that Adele had other hits waiting for my discovery. And even if she didn't the price of the album would almost be worth it for just that one song.But all but maybe 2 or 3 of these songs are really good. Her remake of The Cure's ""Love Song"" is decent enough to be on the album but is possibility the weakest of the offerings on ""21""."
Got the CD promtply and in perfect shape; thank you! Will probably buy more very soon. I don't know the hell I should write more than 2- words about a CD. i ordered it got it like it. End of story. thanks
"She wrote every song on this record at the age of 21 and that by itself is quite impressive. And her voice - all I can say is WOW. I particulary enjoy ""Set Fire to the Rain"" and ""He Won't Go""."
"Adele has crafted a stunning album of songs that shows she just gets better with age.  Her vocals are sheer perfection.  There is no artifice or gimmicks--just power and genuine emotion.  Perhaps because she is a songwriter Adele uses her ample singing ability to serve the lyrics of her songs.  She doesn't over do it like a Christina Aguilera she tells her tales of heartbreak and redemption with conviction and integrity.  All the songs are fabulous. It's a great record that you can play from start to finish and just marvel at.  ""Rolling in the Deep"" is a masterpiece of sass and soulful power.  ""Turning Tables"" and ""Someone Like You"" will give you chills--they are perfect.  Her jazzy take on ""Lovesong"" is a terrific cover--it changes the song just enough to warrant the cover while leaving just enough of what people liked about the original.  ""Rumour Has It"" is percussive brilliance.  ""Set Fire to the Rain"" is special for its ability to take some of Adele's retro soul and move it into a more modern sound.  ""He Won't Go"" continues the merging of Adele's sublime throwback soul power with a rhythmic R&B; sound reminiscent of the very best Mary J. Blige.  ""I'll Be Waiting"" is a wonderfully surprising upbeat number that really works. The production on the album is flawless--it never suffocates the emotion and vitality of the songs.  This album gets better and better with every listen.What sets Adele apart from all of the big voiced divas out there is exemplified on ""21.""  She doesn't hide behind a gimmick superfluous melisma or bland tunes.  Adele seems game for taking what she does best and moving it in different directions.  She isn't tied to doing just old school soul she pushes herself to be more creative.  She found all this at 21.  I can't wait for ""25."""
Lives up to the expectations with her strong voice and lyrics.  Good songs.  Good voice. Good instrumentals.  What more do you want.
"Adele accumulated a strong following of fans given her soulful debut19Adele pulled off mass upsets at the 2009 Grammy's when she won Best New Artist and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for here exceptional hit ""Chasing Pavements.""  Adele's image has since grown since here nearly platinum certified debut and sophomore LP21is on pace to be one of 2011's biggest hits.  Commercial aspirations aside (the album is a projected #1)  '21' is an exceptional well rounded effort.  There is very little to quibble about and if anything Adele's already stunning vocals have grown even more stunning and standout.  Sure some material pales to the very best here and on her debut (there is arguably no ""Chasing Pavements"") but regardless Adele sounds so refined it would not really matter.""Rolling in the Deep"" is a sharp contrast to ""Chasing Pavements"" or ""Hometown Glory"" from '19' but it is a truly great contrast.  Written by Adele and co-songwriter Paul Epworth ""Rolling In The Deep"" is an instant classic with its strummed guitar big drums vintage sounding piano and feisty lead vocals. ""Rolling in the Deep"" channels 1960s folk pop and R&B; and synthesizes the diverse styles perfectly.  The songwriting is exceptional with the chorus standing out the most: ""We could have had it all (you're gonna wish you never had met me) Rolling in the deep (Tears are gonna fall rolling in the deep) You had my heart inside your hands (You're gonna wish you had never had met me) and you played it to the beat..."" Grammy-worthy? Definitely.""Rumour Has It"" is equally exceptional bringing in stand-out producer/songwriter Ryan Tedder (of One Republic) to further accentuate Adele's sound.  The production work is exceptional unsurprisingly given Tedder's consummate successes with Beyonc&eacute; (""Halo"") and Kelly Clarkson (""Already Gone"").  Tedder's signature `big drums' mix harmoniously with Adele's full voice.  Another home-run Adele is on a roll.  ""Turning Tables"" keeps Ryan Tedder along for the ride in this wonderful mid-tempo ballad.  Sans percussive accompaniment ""Turning Tables"" instantly reminds one of Adele's previous hit ""Hometown Glory.""  The songwriting continues to standout particularly the dramatic bridge: ""Next time I'll be braver I'll be my own savior When the thunder calls for me Next time I'll be braver I'll be my own savior Standing on my own two feet...""  Three for three - that is all that can be said.""Don't You Remember"" is no miss either  continuing to showcase the finesse that embodies Adele.  ""Set Fire To The Rain"" continues in the vein of ""Hometown Glory"" without superseding it with its minimalistic piano line.  ""He Won't Go"" is a true standout following solid listens from ""Don't You Remember"" and ""Set Fire To The Rain.""  Here there is no question this is a neo-soul song given the soul aura is given off from the onset with its incredible production work.  ""Take It All"" finds Adele teaching a vocal masterclass to say the least with the great nuances about her powerful vocals.  The upper register of Adele's voice is as powerful as her bluesy lower and middle register.""I'll Be Waiting"" may be the slightest bit overproduced but makes the smart move to contrast the tempo of the churning ""Take It All"" in favor of a faster speed.  The sound is vintage all the way which matches the lyricism.  ""One And Only"" finds the British soulstress `taking the listeners to church' with the gospel-vibe given off by the production work.  The only quibble is one wishes for the gospel choir to come in at the very end of this lengthy cut and complete the emotional build-up. Nonetheless it is a beautiful and stand-out.  ""Lovesong"" finds Adele channeling a cooler more restrained vibe - though she does it with perfection.  ""Someone Like You"" ends the album ok but not as exceptionally as the album opened.Overall21is a brilliant effort.  It is not perfect but it is easily one of the best albums to bow in 2011 if not the best as of yet.  Adele has a prodigious talent and one hopes she continues to showcase her brilliant voice for years and years to come. 4 stars."
This album is excellent. Beautiful voice & this is one of only a few albums I can say I enjoy each & every track.
So I got this for my wifes birthday.  It is not like the cd needs promoting Adele is amazing on her own. Its my wife's cd but I have listened to it as well great music and soul.
My girls all talked about her you hear her on the radio but I didn't really know much about her music until the latest Bond movie.  So I checked out Amazon and was quite amazed but her voice her music and the stories in the music.  For such a young star she has a bright bright future and I am looking forward to her next CD already.
Adele is a very talented singer who shows a lot of herself with this album. The album has a lot of hits that is good from start to finish
Unlike so much overproduced commercial pop these days Adele is the real deal. The music is fantastic and really reaches down inside of you to where feelings come from. Her voice is powerful and delicate at the same time. Reminds me at times of lots of other artists without being derivative and end the sound is all hers. The only problem is that she is not performing in enough locations in her upcoming US tour.
Adele is way over rated. Average songs and voice. Are other artists so bad that you fall for an average at best hyped singer?
Packaging and Album arrived in perfect condition.  This will stay sealed in my collection.  The album is sealed and has all the looks of a brand new album - just the way I like it and just as I ordered.
"Adele's second studio album has arrived with a force! Adele Adkins is a young singer-songwriter (22 now but wrote songs for this album while 21) from England. In this sophomore outing she enlists the help of respected producers like Rick Rubin (Dixie Chicks Red Hot Chili Peppers) and Ryan Tedder among others.  I've been listening to songs from this album for the past 3 weeks and I truly love it. The words ""Easy Listening"" come to mind not  because it identifies the album's musical genre; but because the songs in it are so approachable so easy to enjoy while doing whatever. Musical instruments are kept to a minimum in most tracks with a piano an acoustic guitar or set of drums providing some of the musical setting. But really the center instrument here is Adele's voice (no complaints here). My favorite songs in the album are ""Rolling in the Deep"" ""Someone Like You"" (next promotional single) and ""Don't You Remember"". While I truly enjoy this album I don't think this is a stellar or perfect album. Unfair as it might be to point this out Adele is still developing as an artist. While everything here sounds great one might also be left with the feeling that she's barely scratching the surface of her talent. Still a truly enjoyable surface!"
love love love this!! would recommend to everyone out there who like Adele's type of music. Buy yours today at Amazon it's really hard coming up with 20 words for review....
I dont know what to say about Adele that most people dont probably already know.  She is amazing.  I do not have her first album but this one is just amazing.  The songs are tear jerkers & her voice is so fabulous!
EXCELLENT!! I LOVE ADELE!!!! This is PERFECT!!  I listen to it constantly and would recommend it to any and everyone!
Love to hear her sing! She has such a strong voice! A very talented woman.  I normally listen to the country genre but I enjoy listening to Adelle!
I have been listening to this CD NON-STOP since it's release.  Adele is pure talent!  From the lyrics to the vibe of the music you feel it deep within your soul.  A fresh lovely and welcome break from the what-the-heck-is-that-crap?! that floods the airwaves.  You will not be disappointed with this purchase!
This album is so incredibly beautiful. Adele takes her vocal abilities to a whole new level that was already amazing to begin with. Rolling In The Deep Rumor Has It Turning Tables Someone Like You I'm only naming the songs I already know the words to after a week with the album haha. It's a great mix of catchy tunes with touching songs that make you reminisce on old flames. LOVE 21! Adele has done it again. :)
I love this artist. She is so wonderful. This music came out of nowwhere but I love it. If you like Mariah Carey then you love this.
What a great voice she has!!  I love all the songs on this CD.  Very enjoyable to listen to over and over!
have bought both her CD's and can not wait for her to produce others. have listen to her songs continuously
I don't usually buy a complete CD but I took a chance on this one and it was well worth it every song was great!
if i hear anymore of this i will freak out every hour is a bit too much.how many times does she say rumor has it . wow  put this cd to rest.
Obviously this is a great record and was number one forever but it sounds soooo good on 180 gram. Love blasting this!
There is something very special about her music just find it hard to explain. Her music just seems to put you in a good mood.
i bought this for my son inlaw and he likes most of the songs. cant say for sure about all songs it was a gift.
Nearly every song on the album has a story behind it from the aftermath or a nasty argumen(turning tables) to reconciling with an old flame. It has seriously changed me in so many ways. I love class rock but there really isn't album of that genre and era that can even come close to this masterpiece. Adele sounds better than ever.
my 20 something  granddaughter was laughing at me for listening to this cd. she said its for young girls and her boyfriend said he didn`t like to admit that he liked her music and didn`t around his friends. i might be the only member of her 65 yr old male fan group but i love this cd.her voice reminds me of janis joplin and the writing on these songs by all the various writers is brilliant .i just turn it up and sing along. great choice.mh
"This is a great CD...we initially bought it for the few songs we know from the radio (Rolling In The Deep Rumour Has It Set Fire to the Rain)....but it turns out that ALL the songs on this CD are great tunes...and we were very pleasantly surprised to hear Adele's version of The Cure's ""Lovesong"" on this CD.....what a fantastic voice you have Adele!....we hope you keep belting them out....we're looking forward to one day purchasing Adele 25 Adele 30 etc. when you reach those milestones!"
Easy download! Like the quality of transfer andfast access to it as soon as the payment is placed. I love it.
This is a great album - I like Adele's voice - it is unique and her songs are great .
This CD is simply amazing!  But I guess y'all already knew that since it took me forever to rate it.
"Adele's second album 21 is a truly amazing and thoroughly pleasing collection of Adele's newest songs with flawless performances stretching her already stupendous vocal talents to a whole new level.  She sings each and every song (there's no filler here) with true conviction.  Of course the lead single ""Rolling In The Deep"" is constantly thrilling and toe-tapping.  ""Someone Like You"" can make you cry and so what?  That's what Adele does best - pull you in through every absorbing emotional powerful performance."
"I cannot stop listening to ""21"" by Adele. Starting with ""Rolling in the Deep"" and continuing through to the emotional closer ""Someone Like You"" her strong voice and heartfelt singing inspire great feeling and radiate depth. Every song is a winner; the production is seamless and supportive. It just proves that greatness is still out there that commercial success and artistry can exist side by side and that it is possible to make a complete fulfilling musical statement within the confines of one project. A must-have for every music lover. Bravo!"
If you've ever loved and lost you will complete relate to her lyrics.  If you love Adele's soulful voice and the beautiful sound or orchestra instruments you will love this CD.  Buy it.  Now.
Great singer like almost all the songs. Excited to hear the Cure cover. If you like Adele's singles I'd recommend it
I never knew Adele exist  I herd 1 song of hers from this cd so I purchased it to my surprise I'm happy that I did.
i like adele's voice and i think she has a cool vibe going on i just hope this isn't gimmicky because a retro 60's thang has been going on the past several years with british female acts trying to bring back a 60's motown thang and other styles which is cool to a certain point but then it feels gimmicky on a another level. adele is a cool artist and i look to when she starts to sound more modern and if she is able to balance the time periods. this is a cool album.i like her voice though overall more than the songs and i'm looking toward where she is in time.
This is an exquisite compilation of music written and performed by an extraordinary talent. If you really want to enjoy it at its best play it on a rainy evening and sink into it.
"I realy like Adele and knew I had to get her CD. This one and ""19"" I bought. They are the first CD's I've purchased in.....I don't even know how many years!She is awesome!"
Sold by: B68 Solutions LimitedJust horrible! I saw thought the plastic wrapping on the left hand side there was a crack. Couldn't get a replacement shipped from Amazon; instead got a refund of $2.00. However the worse was yet to come! I opened the CD case and out fell the CD onto my lap. Why? Because the part which holds the CD in place that circular centre thing was half gone!
After hearing a few songs by Adele on the radio I purchased this CD on Amazon.ca. I haven't purchased a CD in years as I find it a waste to buy a CD for one or two songs but I was not disappointed. I liked all the songs on this one and I love popping this CD in  putting the top down on the car and hitting the road!
I am new to Adele's music.  I love every song on this CD.  I am looking forward to her other CDs.
I bought this CD based on word of mouth. It is SO GOOD!  Hard to believe she is only 21. Rolling in the Deep is probably my favorite but Rumors is close behind...actually I love them all.You will not be unhappy if you love strong bluesy music performed by someone with soul.
"I can't think of too many second albums this good.  It is a LEAST as good as 19 if not better.  There are some really great songs on here at the beginning and the end of the album and the stuff in the middle isn't bad either (not a lot of filler or throw away songs here).  ""Rolling in the deep"" is probably the best known but ""Rumor has it"" and many others are excellent as well.  Hard to believe this is the voice of a 21 year old.  Highly recommended."
I just love this album.  I know I'll wear it out because it's always on in my car.  I am looking forward to purchasing more by Adele.
"I actually thought this was a better album than ""19"" which won her two Grammys.  I really enjoyed the whole album and listened to it all in one sitting.  The feeling on the album is consistent from the first track ""Rolling in the Deep"" to the last one ""Someone Like You.""  With the names of the albums reflecting her age I actually do hear a little more maturity in her work on this album.  I can't wait to see what she has to offer us in a decade."
Adele belts out a rock song like you cannot believe: and has a smokey amazing voice for ballads. Truly fantastic
Saw her on Ellen and fell in love with her music. See all so did the song to Skyfall and I down loaded it. Adele has a great voice
I ordered Adele 19 after hearing her on some awards show and really enjoyed the quirky style and lyrics and of coarse her amazing voice. When I hear the song Rumor Has It from this album I fell in love with the rhythm and the power of the song which was very different from her previous work so I thought I take a chance and buy this CD too.It was totally worth it. Well recorded which really matters to me. The entire album is a collection of great tunes clever and interesting music as well as lyrics tied together with Adele's amazing voice.Some CD's I buy and like but listen to them as background music. Adele 21 holds my attention and my imagination. I love to play it on the way home from work somehow I get lost in the music and forget about work and the day. I find myself getting home wishing the drive was a little longer so I can hear more of the CD!Take a chance buy the CD there are a number of hits on it already I think there could be more if they release them to Radio or XM.
Heard this album at my daughters when on holiday there my husband thoroughly enjoyed it so when we returned to France we purchased it and listed on a regular basis certainly we are both Adele converts.
Adele is unique in the way that she is still able to sing write and perform from a powerful place that's true to her on an emotional level which is why it resonates so much with people who listen to her. You know she's been through some s#!t and tells you all about when she writes. Fantastic work!
Adele's newest CD is fantastic! She has grown as a person and her singing is just getting better! She has a powerful voice and has a great pressance on this album. I would recommend this CD to anyone who is interested. There is only one song that I do not like. All the other songs are fantastic! :D
cd arrived with a broken and busted case. i can see why it was wrapped so tightly in plastic now. once i pulled off the sticky plastic wrapping the case fell apart in my hands and the cd slid right out of the broken holster in the center. this was supposed to be a new cd that i purchased at the full price. i've bought used cds in far more better conditions. i will never buy from this buyer again.
A modern-day Alanis (as my husband calls her) Adele has a great sultry smokey angsty voice that I just love.  However it was very difficult to appreciate on THIS CD.  Super grainy sounded like a second-rate burned CD not happy with it.
Excellent CD but you don't need a review from me to know that look at the awards she has received.
I bought this for a friend and co-worker of mine as a holiday gift and I was introduced to new music that appeals to my ears.
As all Adele music this is a very good CD.  I would recommend it to anyone that like her music.
I got this for my husband and we both LOVE this CD and know why she won all of the grammy's!
This artist is the best to come along in a long time.  The mix is great on this CD.  Highly recommend to any jazz buffs.
Got it within a few days. It was a gift so I don't know how it played however I haven't heard any complaints :)
This is a woman who has a voice better than most...and no nonsense music to go along with it. Lots of talent here.
"Must admit I am late to the Adele party.  When ""Rolling in the Deep"" first came out I liked the song and I loved hearing this ""different"" almost raspy voice that she has.  Then a month later I was sick of her.  Tired of hearing ""Rolling In the Deep"" play on EVERY damn radio station EVERY 10 minutes.  I hated on Adele a lot because of this because I was so sick of hearing the song.  No way in hell was I going to buy her cd.After she won all the grammys I figured what the hell I'll give her a chance.  Wow I am completely blown away at how good this cd is.  Makes me kick myself for not getting it earlier and feeling like I jumped on the bandwagon.  The WHOLE cd is amazing and it's very rare for me to buy a cd and not have to fast forward through a song.  Not only is her voice fantastic but the production of the music is incredible too.  I am normally an R&B; and Hip-Hop fan but this cd is a MUST BUY for any fan of music."
Do research before buying this Vinyl album.  The recording is dry and the digital download is not available.  Will not buy from this producer again.
My very first Adele album.  Had heard a couple of songs that I really liked so I bought the cd.  Sure am glad I did!
I can relate to alot of songs on this CD!  Great CD!  I love the &#34;Lovesong&#34; at the end of the CD!
I just went to see Adele in concert recently and I have to say her voice live is even better than the album! 21 is one of the only albums that I have bought that I have enjoyed every song on. Her voice ranges from world weary and slightly bitter to hopeful and triumphant to sassy. I don't/won't compare to her any other artist vocally. Her voice is unique and she definitely has an old soul. Amazing in one so young and she has made me a fan for life! I can't wait to see how much she grows in the future as an artist. 21 is a fantastic musical legacy and will hold up well 20-30 years from now.
When you first time heard it it was not so bad but if you heard it for another two times you may feel your ears hurt. Her voice is truly not clear and attractive.
"I had avoided Adele since she broke out in the US with ""Chasing Pavements"" - I didn't really like it it was overplayed and I did not get the Adele sensation sweeping everyone young and old rich and poor tall and short male or female. I bought 21 because I liked ""Rolling in the Deep"" but never listened past the second song - ""Rolling in the Deep"" is the first song I'm not a huge fan of the second song and so I assumed the rest of the album wasn't my taste. I was wrong about that. The other night I decided to skip the first two songs and see what else was there to be heard. I didn't have to wait long. The third song ""Turning Tables"" was the most emotionally affecting piece of ""new"" music (I know this album is like a year old now) that I've heard in probably at least a year. It makes me feel like my heart is exploding into light and rainbows and then being smashed into smithereens before I see it coming. I listened to it probably 25 times over the next 2 days. I continue to listen to it daily. I haven't explored the entire rest of the album yet but have skimmed enough to know that I love ""I Found A Boy"" almost as much. The song is Adele's voice and no more than what sounds like an unaffected Fender Telecaster playing a sort of Jeff Beck-style bluesy guitar piece paired with her old skool soul vocals. I will say that the production on both ""Turning Tables"" and ""I Found A Boy"" is superb... each song involves the exact instruments it should and not one that doesn't belong. The choice to feature the strings so prominently on the former and the sparseness of the latter take the songs from great to wonderful.  So far I'm so stuck on those two I haven't listened to the rest of the album enough to give it a fair review but I'll come back and add on later."
after waiting for my cd and then getting it i have mixed feelings about it she has a great voice music is great but the words to most of the songs are very depressing ive listened to it alot and i mean alot getten to like it a little better but a few songs i just skip!hoping her new one has different stuff on it but doughtful
She is brilliant and her voice is one of the best of the ages.  Do hope she is happy now with her new child and will continue writing and singing when she has time.
A lot of the popular songs and some you don't hear too much. Good disc with almost current songs on it
What can I say about Adele without being boring and going on and on... not much because Ica just say I LOVE it and that she had a voice that is just amazing
"Haunting mesmerizing true inspiring!""Someone Like You"" tears at your heart; it's brutally honest and crushingly sad! It's full of what-ifs and regrets..regrets we've all had at some points in our lives."
Bought this as one of my wife's Christmas gifts. She is absolutely &#34;Gaga&#34; over it. She loves it me too so what more could we want.Thanks
I am closing in on 61 years old.  Classic rock is my primary musical preference.  I am very critical of younger artists.  That being said I was amazed myself at how much I have enjoyed Adele 21.  I first heard Rolling in the Deep on a video station and was intrigued by the haunting background vocalists.  I bought the CD for the only song I had heard and was pleased with almost every cut.
What more can one say about this CD. This CD is a must have for all those Adele fans out there.
I just purchased this recording on CD and can only say that we haven't heard her genius yet sonically. This incredible artist deserves a proper recording which she hasn't yet received. Shame shame shame on the crappy treatment she has so far received at the hands of her corporate handlers. One day this recording will be remastered (Mobile Fidelity ??? or who ???)and brought to proper light by a team that understands talent sonic importance and art.The amateur crap team that was put in place to deliver this woman's songs and visions on this recording is an utter disappointment for her and for the rest of us who care about genius and its' appearance in our lives. I hope I live long enough to witness justice for the arts take place regarding this painting. Again shame on you corporate crap manipulators and get the product to market quickly/cheaply financialists......
"I was cruising along the highway listening to the radio and in the middle of a set in comes this soulful tune that reminds me of the tunes I grew up listening to with my parents.  You know what came next the deep somewhat tortured voice and lyrics that make up the tune that I now know as ""Rolling in the Deep"".  I was hooked!  On a mission (when I take on one of these I cannot be deterred) I had to find out who this was and what was the name of that song!Even though I was not familiar with Adele I purchased this CD with no reservations at all. From the beginning to the end...this collection of her feelings expressed through music is STELLAR!!!  I do not care what age you are or what you usually listen to I am confident that there is room in your collection for this.  If nothing else when you have the folks over this is how you will impress them with your versatility ;DI have shared this find with many and I have not had one complaint yet only ""Thanks for sharing...GREAT find!""  I must agree!"
"Bought this for my husband's 80 year old grandmother. I played ""Rolling in the deep"" and ""Someone like you"" for her during a recent visit and she absolutely loved it. I am not typically a fan but I am an Adele fan. I love her voice there's so much emotion behind it."
the album is great! I think Adele is one of the best singers we have today and the songs are lovely.
Awesome CD! Adele at her best! Such a talent for a debut album! All Adele fans will greatly enjoy this CD!
Ordered this item whilst in Australia to be sent to Australiait said it would take up to six weeks for delivery arrived in less than threeIt was a present for my daughter who loved iteven with postage the whole thing worked out cheaper than buying it from a store in Australia
It's new collection shows the growth in Adele's understanding. It is world class & has so many good tracks that you can identify with recommended for anyone who enjoys music.
Fast and Easy arrived as desired on time and in perfect condition. ADELE21 is easily my favorite CD. Great Singer-singing w/ thought provoking lyrics.
Going through a divorce I could relate to this CD. It's a wonderful sound her voice is beautiful. Just don't start drinking & listening to this CD you'll regret either the phone calls you make or the e-mails you may send.
With the unbelievable genius of this album we can only hope that this talented artist continues to move us as much as she did with this for years to come.  I bought this on digital CD Vinyl and DVD!
A couple of great songs from a versatile singer a range of styles and succeeds with them all. Well worth it.
This lady is very talented.  The use of a voice like I have never heard before and I've got decades & decades behind me.  Sort of hard to put her in a certain class of music closest I could come up with would be Blues and Croner.  I have purchased a piece of music for 5 years or so  but I was so drawn to this piece it was hard to refuse.Don't think anyone could go wrong purchasing it.
Adele makes you wanna cry and sing all at the same time.  She has a voice way beyond her years and a knack of finding the perfect words.  I still feel like I need a daily fix of her...
was looking for this and didn't want to pay top dollar just for the two songs I liked. but as I listened the the able enjouy almost all the songs.
"OMG!  This is a great CD!  I have been waiting on this album since ""Rolling in the Deep"" was released and it doesn't disappoint.  Adele is awesome!"
I brought this as a gift and now they can't stop playing this cd.  I also love this cd.  Great job Adele!!
a few good songs the rest too plain and rather boring...she has a beautiful voice though.  maybe the songs will get better.
I bought this album on vinyl played on my 80 dollar audio technica turntable. it is nothing short of amazing sounding through a pair of Senn HD650's
I love this CD because I think Adele is perfect.  Her voice is impeccable her style of singing is wonderful and she is just a beautiful lady.  I am ready to buy the next one.
"I must be in the minority-- I couldn't get to this album or the artist either. Adele does a lot of screaching throughout the CD that gets really old after a while. Using it for affect is one thing; but as a constant part of your interpretation of the music that is something entirely different. I picked up the CD after a friend of mine gushed about this CD; proclaiming it to be one of her all-time favorites bar none. And admittedly Rolling in the Deep was a catchy song. I couldn't help but compare Adele to Joss Stone-- another British ""Soul"" singer-- which reminded me of the movie about the british ""soul"" band The Commitments. So to me there is nothing fresh or unique about Adele's contribution to the British Soul-Singer genre. As one other reviewer commented all the songs started to sound the same with the same vocal inflections etc."
I love the technology of being able to download an album.  I can save it on my computer and in the &#34;cloud&#34; in case something happens to my computer.  Once I buy 'hard copy' CD's I always save them to my computer anyway and then the CD just takes up unnecessary space.
She has really an impressive voice! Singing with piano only.... Well this is something that not many singers can do with such a great success and impression!!!!
I bought this for the Bond Firefall theme song but I've fallen in love with Adele's voice. She's a class act and her voice is like velvet.
"I love 21.  It's a great album from start to finish.  21 is a perfect sequel for Adele and serves as further proof that her music cannot be ""genre-ized"".  I admit I cheated a little and got the british version which was released before the U.S version.  But I just didn't want to wait more than I had to.  Adele has definitely grown up since 19.  Her story telling abilities really come out more in this album than they did in the last.Rolling in the Deep is the lead song and quite frankly it's the best on 21.  But don't assume that it's the only good song here far from it.  I particularly liked ""Roumor has It"" which I though was very catchy and just plain fun.  ""Set Fire to the Rain"" is a very good song that provides a perfect example of just power strong Adele's voice really is.  I appreciated the fact that Adele is able to sing without the use of a lot of background noise to make her sound good; a lot of the songs on this album are just here and a guitar or her and a piano.  These songs tend to be more personal for her so it seems.  Songs like ""Love Song"" ""Hiding My Heart"" and ""Someone Like You"" are attest to this as they are perfectly tender.21 is a great album.  But I suggest you get the deluxe version when it comes out."
this was ordered shipped and played without any waste....I will use them again and again.....musicshop 780 is not related to me in any wayexcept as a sorce of hours of pleasant listening.I was not paid for this endorsement and I am not a spokeperson for them either.I am YOU the reader of reviews....
Adele has a wonderful unique sound!  We are enjoing the full CD not just the songs we hear on the radio.
"I enjoy Adele's voice and as a general rule  all her music. However The first two songs were the only "" up "" songs on the CD . I found all the other songs to be very sad and depressing."
Great Item Very Fast Shipping My daughter has been wanting this item and she will love it when she gets it for her Birthday. Would buy from this seller again.  A++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++SELLER!
Have enjoyed several songs that are on the CD not just the one I ordered it for.  Was definitely not disappointed with this selection.
love this album!
Great CD. if it was vinyl it would be worn out and grooved by now. Did I just date myself.  LOVED IT ! ! !
What a fabulous CD.  Adele is very versatile and original with her song so this CD did not disappoint me
She has the best &#34;smoky&#34; voice out there.  Her soul with all its love and pain  is truly in her voice.
"How refreshing to hear just a beautiful voice and lyrics that make sense.  I'm nearing 70 but still enjoy the more current music and I find this very ""heartfelt"" music.""21"" is not the same mumbled words over and over with background music so loud that you can't hear or understand the words.  I watched the Grammy's and as stated before - this is sooo very refreshing after watching/listening to some of the performers."
My first experience with Adele and it was worth it. Her voice is lush and beautiful. Will buy many more.
I love her soulful voice.  It really touches my heart to see someone so young produce music that feels so old.  I look forward to her future endevours.
I chose 5 star is because Adele has agreat voiceI hope she brings more cdsI recommed this to anyone.
Adele has good a pretty good voice...but the album itself is over-rated...Her whole album (every single song) is about breaking up with her ex...(how about a little diversity)..that being said after listening to about 3 songs you start to bored as every single song sounds about the same with the same theme and the same blue feeling to the song.
"After reading rave after rave on this site from viewers around the globe well let me add my two-cents worth.I was passing through the airport in Taipei Taiwan last week when a song piped out the terminal speakers.  I immediately stopped in my tracks and said ""WHO the hell is this woman?""  At first I thought ""Dusty Springfield""?  I tried to get an answer.  Finally a friendly Chinese sales clerk told me in her charming accented English -- ""Oh it's Adele she's singing 'Rolling In The Deep"".  BINGO!!  After months and months of hearing about this artist it finally kicked in -- at an airport terminal of all places.I finally realized what ALLLLL the fuss has been about.  I purchased the CD on the spot and the entire disc kept me company for the 12-hour flight from Taipei to L.A.  On the plane with my Sony disc player I laughed cried smiled and was blown away by this spectacular CD.  Each time the disc reached the end I instantly hit 'Repeat' and I was immediately transported back to Adele's world of heartbreak pain and loss -- with some joy and celebration thrown in.I could relate to almost every song on the CD having traveled down the path that Adele has traveled.  Obviously this amazingly talented young woman is writing and singing from the depths of her soul and she sings about experiences that everyone can  relate to or has experienced themselves.  It's hard to believe she's only in her early Twenties!  She does remind me a bit of her British elder counterpart Dusty Springfield but Dusty never had this much vocal firepower.If there is any justice ""Adele 21"" deserves to win ""Album of the Year"" at next year's Grammys.  My guess is with its sales records and the ""Rolling"" single still being played around the world Adele should pick up a few more Grammys to add to her collection.  ""21"" is an amazing aural sensation that any serious music lover should get to feel and experience.  It will move you and hit you in the gut when you least expect it.  I have not been blown away in many years as I have with this CD.  As much as I love Gaga and Katie (they've each been bashed unfairly on this site) Adele is just on an entirely different level.Adele manages to cross racial age gender and other barriers in her  ability to move.  Now isn't that what music is all about?  Amazing!"
Adele is an amazing singer and this album most definitely shows it. So many brilliant songs on this record. I highly recommend it. It can be a little bit depressing at times though since every single song is about how she's single. :/
I like her raspy/soulful voice. Great music behind it as well. All around decent buy. I can see this album being good for a fun road trip!
I usually don't get moved by just anything and this album is definetively not anything. I have already heard it like 50 times and 50 times I feel her passion.
I had heard so many great things about this album and this woman. Now I know why since getting it for Mother's Day. Her sound is unique and very heartfelt. You really feel the emotion in her music. Even my kids fell in love with this album and have their favorite songs! It's nice to not have to skip over songs for objectionable lyrics too! I highly recommend it.
This is the most wonderful album of modern music. Adele has a way of singing these songs that brings them to life. Each has its own spirit. I highly suggest for any fan of classical yet modern music.
I got this CD for my girlfriend as a surprise after she told me how much she liked &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34;. She likes the album but she says it's pretty sad to listen to sometimes. This is a good present for a girl who needs something to listen to in the car.More than a year later I still see her take it out sometimes!
Great voice amazing music.  I really enjoy Adele as an artist.  Either you like her or you don't do not know why amazon requires so many words
"There are so many reviews here that mine feels quite hidden and unnecessary but I love this album so much that I have to put my two cents in. There is no track on this album I don't love several are outstanding though-""About a boy"" is beautiful and describes everything that I felt during my break up and of course the almost overplayed ""someone like you"". The songs are addictive! The album genuinely touched my emotions thank you Adele!"
"I'm not trying to hate on the artist or anything but I don't not get her popularity at all. She's labeled as ""pop"" a lot of the time but she's anything but. Maybe that's why I'm not that in to her music because pop is my favorite genre. But even if this is not my type of music I don't see how this album has produced three #1 singles. The three #1 singles: ""Rolling in the Deep"" ""Someone Like You"" and ""Set Fire to the Rain"" are all dull and boring and sound very similar. I can see how she's sold so many albums because her music is what a lot of people consider ""credible"" and this type of music sells albums but I don't get the singles success. I remember in early 2008 when her song ""Chasing Pavements"" was released and how utterly boring it was and this album is in the same exact vein as her first. Her songs all sound the same but maybe that's what a lot of people like. Don't get me wrong she seems like a lovely person it's just that her music and sound is very monotonous and one-dimensional."
This album is infused with passion you can hardly listen to a song without being swept up by all the emotion. I listen to this album over and over and it only gets better. We need more ladies with voices like this singing their true feelings.
great music....however the CD was smashed horribly when i open the 'padded' envelope it came in. wonder why they can't ship in boxes?
After visiting many web sites for the purchase of the album Adele 21 it was clear that Amazon.com was the best choice. In addition the purchase was easy the download was simple fast and having a cloud for backup was also the best choice.I am very happy for this choice and believe me for me to leave a review is evidence of the same. I don't waste time leaving reviews unless there is value behind them. No doubt Adele 21 has great songs and her voice is unique clear passionate and leaves you with wanting more...
i love her music had to have her cdthe price was exceptionally great ordered it and am very happy i got it
It is really a great cd.  It was inexpensive and arrived quiclkly.  I love listening to it in my car and at the house also.
I soooooooooo love her music. there is not one song that I don;t like on this album. can't wait to buy the next one
I loved her first album and she has pushed herself more on this second.  It is terrific!  Can't stop listening!
Adele's voice is amazing. My favorite track on the cd is One and Only. Her sound is clear sweet with a touch of raw blues that lifts Adele head and shoulders above other young singers. I'm looking forward to her next cd.
I have had this album for a few months and I've enjoyed it very much.  Then I finally played it on an audiophile quality stereo.  The purity of Adele's voice evokes a physical response.  If you have a real stereo buy this CD.
Been listening to Mp3 and CD of this album since it was frist came out I was so happy to find the Vinyl version. And seriously I never want to listen to the CD and MP3 again. To feel Adele as she really is to feel the beauty of her voice and the instruments you should experience vinyl ;-).
There are at least 4 hit songs that could come from this CD.  Rolling in the Deep is the first single the record company is pushing.  The others are Rumour Has It Set Fire to the Rain and One and Only.  This could be on the charts for a long time.
Adele did a great job showing powerful vocals and lyrics. Nice collection of songs.Also very nice work done by the background vocalists and musicians.
In a day and age when everyone is autotuned and production is huge listening to this is like a breath of fresh air. Its organic in its simplicity and powerful in its delivery. This album speaks to everyone in every generation. It is truly a work of art.
turned my whole family on to adele!!! this is the first CD i have bought in years and i love every song!!1 i have prob listened to it over 100 times!! its in constant repeat in my car!!!
Not only is her voice so unique and beautiful the songwriting on this album is nothing short of superb. Usually I don't like entire albums but this is one of the rarities for sure from beginning to end this album is awesome.
This is a great album of Adele's hits.  I really enjoyed the music and I hope that more albums are coming.
This is a phenomenal record plays great and the sleeve artwork is fantastic. Shipped quickly and safely. I am very happy with this order. Would recommend it to anyone!
this CD gets played all the time. I never get tired of her husky soulful voice and the lyrics are so perfect. I feel like she wrote them for me. she has been hurt and those songs are so relate-able.. she is fantastic and this is probably going to be her best CD ever.
She really captures love and heartache in her songs.  Her vocals are unique and unlike any artist out there.  I can't wait to here upcoming albums.  I wish she her tour brought her by Houston.  I'm sure she puts on a great show.
What a voice!  This is one of those CDs that you will be able to listen to all the way through.
I primarily listen to just two of her songs. I just can not seem to focus on the remaining songs. The two I enjoy are rolling in the deep and set fire to the rain. Very very powerful songs.
Only has just a few good songs (the hits probably 3 o 4).I can't believe this is classified as alternative rock c'mon!!!
it has been a really long time since an artists voice has grabbed me like this...when she sings...the music almost gets inside of you and you feel it. shes amazing...im sad ive only just discovered her.
I havent been this excited over a cd in ages its brilliant Adele is brilliant and beautiful and its just so fresh and new and original. Very soulful yet retro yet modern from beginning to end. A new masterpiece of an album and a voice so unique! 21 is Album of the year for me.
I think ADELE is awesome and I think 19 and 21 are great albums I can honestly say I love every song on album. Just buy it !
Words cannot describe the talent this girl has.  I love this album from start to finish.  She is incredible.  She is also incredible live-  buy this!
"Adele's sophomore CD ""21"" has been off to a phenomenal start in her native UK. She currently occupies the #1 and 4 spots on the singles and album charts beating off Lady Gaga's over-hyped comeback single in the process.Adele says the lyrics were based on a break-up and this is reflected in quite a few songs. Opening the album is lead-off single ""Rolling In The Deep"" an upbeat soulful blast with a Motown feel followed by the thumping Rock/Soul ""Rumour Has It"" (on which she sings ""She is half your age/But I'm guessing that's the reason that you strayed"").For those that loved her ballads ""Hometown Glory"" or ""Chasing Pavements"" there are lovely piano ballads like ""Turning Tables"" and ""Someone Like You"" (the latter currently the UK #1) about finding a lost love and realising he's moved on but she wishes him well and finds it hard to move on. All the lyrics touch on matters of the heart; longing heartache falling in love. Her dusky soulful vocals make you yearn for more and more.She displays admirable diversity on the album; ""Set Fire To The Rain"" is a sweeping enchanting ballad ""He Won't Go"" a groovy midtempo soulful song that is very Lauryn Hill ""Take It All"" is a Gospel-inflected piano ballad ""I'll Be Waiting"" is Bluesy ""One And Only"" is Country-tinged while the album's highlight has got to be her affecting acoustic cover of The Cure's classic ""Lovesong"". Fantastic! Makes one look forward to 25 30 and beyond."
Nothing is more relaxing than reading a good book on your kindle and listening to Adele. Talk about a great evening.
This is a cool Cd. Especially after not having to pay the regular high price for this Cd. But I'm glad I now have this Cd.
What's not to love?Adele's skillfull voice reached another level of emotioned packed vocal performance.Loved her 19 album this one is even better!
This CD is just awesome. I've heard Adele's stuff before but this album is what really pulled me in. She has such a soulful and rich voice and the lyrics are like they were written from my own soul. I have this CD on repeat play. Goes perfect with a glass of wine :)
Exceptional voice great emotion in all her songs. Her music has so many ranges upbeat to soulful.  Powerhouse of a singer.  Will definitely purchase more of her music
"First let us not get the wrong impression she can sing very well.  ""Rolling In the Deep"" is a blatant rip off of Gnarls Barkley ""Crazy"" which is also a rip off in its own sense.  Once you get past that song every other song seems to sound the same uninspiring boring very typical filler songs just to push an album out.  As an artist Adele is powered by thet social media and has caused many legit artists to be swept under the carpet."
"Let's just put it this way...  First CD/album I've bought and/or downloaded by someone younger than me in God knows how long.  Part country part blues part rock 'n pop.  Adele does it all.  Saw her on the TV news magazine ""60 Minutes"" & fell in love with her style.  Remember...I grew up with the likes of Elvis The Beatles & so many great MoTown stars.  And this gal impresses me...a LOT!  How's that?"
Just played the vinyl which came today sounds great. Also the digital download worked perfectlywent to the directed website entered the code and downloaded the zip file.Old Mike
Loved most of this music. If all her music sounds like this I will be adding Adele to my favorites.
Loved this CD.  Great to listen to anytime any where.Turn the volumme up and enjoy.  Beautiful voice and beautiful lyrics.
I bought this CD solely based on Adele's Tiny Desk Concert on NPR.  She's much better in the intimate setting of TDC with just her and two other bandmates.  Her talent shines through on TDC not so much in the studio.
Adele just have a nice voice. The CD was a present and obviously hearing the songs i was really blown away......!!
Amazing!  21 is the soundtrack to lost love! Limitless in its power to tell a story story of heartbreak  sung by the greatest singer of her generation!!!
When we remember the music of 2011 this will be one of the important records. Surely in this we've heard (and know) more than one song ...
I love Adele and was not disappointed with this CD. If you like Adele this CD is the one you will want to own. Glad I ordered it.
She is amazing. I love the song selections. Sound is great and have enjoyed it immensely. I will buy other cd's by Adele.
Love the CD! My first one from Adele and now I'm a fan for sure! What a fresh raw haunting voice especially on Rolling in the Deep. This woman sings like she has suffered in love/life and experienced a little taste of sweet revenge along the way and her song's emotions reflect this journey ... you will not be disappointed!
As a new listener to Adele I was surprised.  The whole album and her voice is unbelievable.  I have become an Adele fan.
Love Adele will order more.  * * * * ** ** ** ** *** *** ** **** ** ** *
A totaly different kind of music but somehow she is a modern more polished Bonnie Raitt.She too tells good stories.
I love her music I are trying to but all of her music?  I will be happy when I get it all on my ipod!!!
"Honestly I was SO blown away by her first CD (19) that I didn't think 21 could compete. I mean how do you make something that's perfect even better? I still don't have the answer but on this CD Miss Adele proves that she's more than just a one-hit wonder! The depth and warmth and angst in her voice is unparalleled and every time I listen to tracks like ""Turning Tabels"" ""He Won't Go"" ""One and Only"" and ""Someone Like You"" I lose my mind. I enter a spiritual realm and her voice and the lyrics speak to my soul. This is SOUL music at it's finest. There is no one else in music doing it like Adele and I love how she lets her talent speak for her; not her physical beauty. One day soon I am going to see her in concert even if it means flying across the globe to do it."
I am amazed at Adele's talent and had to buy this CD.  Her music is some of the best and what a gifted singer she is.  Can't wait to see what she does next.
This is a good cd that needs to be in everyone's collection. Adele is going to be one of my favorites.
Adele has a gift. He richness in vocals the ability to tell a story and connect with the listener is outstanding. Can't wait to see what her future holds!!
This is a great album it has 4 -5 hits that are currently played on the radio. it shows a wide range of songs & Adele performs well on every one of them. no losers on this album
Her music is so wonderful.  She has a very soulful voice we need more music like this I listen this her cd daily.
I like some songs on this CD just not to hot on the slow music right now I keep on looking thou.
I still don't understand why some critics say her music is boring. Her songs are good and she writes them!! unlike some other young stars... And her voice is amazing.
Just love her voice!
21 is - what can I say....I need to buy 19!  Fabulous album - too short for my liking :)
I heard her recordings several times a thought I would purchase one. Turned on my computer and saw her CD and decided to purchase it now. Played it several times and enjoyed every minute of it. Highly recommend the CD. She has a very unusual vvoice. It normally would not be my kind of music. I am very glad I ordered it.
Adele is one of my favorite singers. This CD has my favorite songs on it. So at the right price I ordered it. It was delivered promptly and also the music was transferred to my KIndle. So no mater where we are we can listen to it.
Just can't play this Cd enough...I had to get another one as the 1st one I bought I played it so much that it jumps so I'm glad for Amazon!
Such a pleasure to have this CD and to find it at such a great price. Thanks for a great selection of products!
This is the best of Adele's CDs.  Her love balads are outstanding.  She has the most different voice to come our way in a long time.  I look forward to her next release.
It is very rare that I like let alone love all of the songs in a album. There's usually one or two that just don't do it for me like the others. I'm more than happy that this album is an exception I absolutely love every song on the album! FLAWLESS!
Soulful soulful singing breathtaking lyrics and on whole a great album.  What more can I say??  I like &#34;Turning Tables&#34; and &#34;Someone Like You&#34;.  It's different beautiful and touching and moving.
"In 21 Adele writes and sings as if she's lived a lifetime over. Her breathtaking lyrics powerful melodies and stripped back power pulls at the deepest wells of human emotion. It's amazing she can pull something like this off when writing the songs at twenty-one years of age. I can't wait to see what else she provides us with 25.Adele's 21 is the  sophomore album from British singer-songwriter that I've eagerly anticipated since her debut album 19.This new collection of songs solidifies her standing as one of my favorite vocalists. But even though it is still Adele's already signature style the album takes on a different vibe than the first. Rather than a more jazzy standards feel that the first album had this new album has a more bluesy gospel old-school country feel to it to which I cannot stop listening.Her vocals are sheer perfection. There is the power and emotion throughout the songs that make them resonate strongly with you. But apart from her vocal style and penetrating tone the strength of her songwriting shines through across all the tracks on this album. It's unbelievable to me that she is able to write such poignant songs of anguish heartache love and joy at her age.Adele has managed to construct a wonderful album with amazing tracks from beginning to end. ""Rolling in the Deep"" has this wonderfully powerful and soulful track where you can completely relate to that moment when you catch someone in their deceptive ways. ""Someone Like You"" will give you chills as the emotion is written across every last note of Adele's vocal. The percussive quality of ""Rumor Has It"" makes it a great bluesy track and ""Take It All"" left the most lasting impression on me through its basic truth and rawness. Even ""Lovesong"" is different enough from the original while holding true to the essence of the song to make it an extremely successful cover.This album has only seemed to get better with every listen. I've had it on repeat since I've downloaded it on iTunes and I haven't found a bad track in the bunch.Rating: A+"
I love this woman's voice and music. Award winning star. Great writer of music. She sings from her soul. We need to see more of her.
Love her music and voice. Very soothing. Some of the songs I could relate to in my own everyday life
A great follow up to Adele's first album 19!  Her voice is spectacular and every song on this CD is wonderful.
I like Adele so I really enjoy the songs on this album.  I would recommend if you like this style of music.
I'm really sick of this album. My 16 year old daughter plays it every other morning; as a result she now owns a fairly comprehensive set of Aretha Franklin courtesy of me. Adele may have one of the greatest voices ever committed to record but her songs are highly derivative of so many I've been hearing for decades that I can't really take her seriously as an artist.
I have almost worn this out?  Love this and cannot wait for her to do her next one?  I am hooked.  Believe me this may not sound like much of new compliment but i am 65 years old and the new music out there does not do much for me but i will probably buy what ever she does next!!!!
The voice captures the heart and the imagination. I feel it is an album that should be in the collections of all music lovers.
This Adele CD is a 12 on a scale of 10. I purchased this CD for her hit song listened to the album a few times and got hooked on every song. There isn't an bad song on this CD in fact there isn't a mediocre song on this CD...they are all amazing songs sung and performed to perfection.
"Let me start off my review by saying I'm not fond of most current music and artists. However I heard a lot of chatter about Adele and her 21 album so I decided to sample it and see what the fuss was all about. Let me tell you the bang to hype ratio is on par. What a refreshing honest emotional album that speaks from the heart.Anyone who's had a broken heart (or even broken a heart) will feel this album. Adele doesn't need auto-tune special studio effects or hardly any instruments backing her. Her voice is so powerful and full of emotion that it can (and does) stand on its own. You can feel every note she sings and not many artists can do that. I can't say enough about her voice--just breathtaking.The production is simple but very effective. I love that they didn't ""trick"" up her voice they just let her belt away and give the songs all they needed. In an age of auto-tune (there's that word again) and studio trickery it's SO refreshing and WELCOMED to hear a true talent be allowed to shine on her own.The songs are all about her past heartbreaking experience(s) with the game of love. It's not whiny or overkill--Adele is able to convene heartache/hurt/pain from a lost love in so many different ways. This is what sets her apart from the rest. For example in the song One and Only she ""dares"" her love to ""give her a chance to prove she's the one who can walk that mile"" where in Someone Like You she's resigned to the fact that her love has moved on and found somebody new but wants him to know that she hasn't. That's just two examples of what Adele is able to do with seemingly one theme.As you can tell I absolutely love this album--it's the best album I've heard in years it's that good. Don't just rely on my word give the record a spin and see for yourself what a true talent Adele is. And while you're listening I dare you NOT to feel the emotion of the album."
"Simply put awesome! Adele has now put out in my opinion two of the strongest albums in recent memory and her Sophomore effort ""21"" actually surpasses the first. Adele has an amazing voice of which much has already been said but I think her songwriting is even more impressive than her voice. A must have!"
I had never heard of Adele before this past month. I heard her single 'Rolling In The Deep.' and instantly fell in love. After hearing 'Rolling In The Deep' and 'Someone Like You' I decided I had to buy '21' to see what this artist is truly about... And boy I wasn't disappointed! Adele's powerful self-written lyrics and deep soulful voice are enough to take you away into a place full of emotions and no pain. This album is truly the most beautiful album I have heard in my life and will without doubt be winning lots of awards in 2011/2012. I definitely expect a 2012 Grammy nomination for album of the year. I look forward to see what Adele will become in the future as she's such a beautiful powerhouse at the young age of 21. I love you Adele :)
I love her style. Sweet. She definitely is the best that I ever heard from. Wish her all the best. and topest one.
"My first thought when I heard her songs was ""Amy Winehouse"" reincarnated with some Lady Gaga-ish music effects thrown in for good measure. She has the same singing style as Ms Winehouse that produces a sound from deep within. Not dissing Adele or Amy W or Lady G - it all makes for great listening but doesnt seem to be unique or original. Songs on the album 19 sounded far more original and fresh. On '21' she sounds more American than Brit. Again - nothing wrong with that but just my observation. I for one am not going gaga (pun intended)."
"Everytime I turned on the radio they were playing a song from this CD..... so I bought it.I like the CD  my favorites  ""He Won't Go"" ""Someone Like You"" ""Rolling In the Deep"" ""Lovesong"" ""Turning Tables"" ""Don't You Remember"" and ""I'll Be Waiting"" her sound reminds me of Stevie Nicks/Aretha Franklin with a hint of Nora Jones!  I believe Adele has ""staying power"" and will be around for a long time!"
I think I finally understand what it means to be a hater. Because I hate her. Because I think she is so great so honest so beautiful so real so talented... her voice...her words...her music... it's all too much for me and it fills me with so much intense emotions that I can't define or contain them. And it makes me hate her.That is probably the realest and weirdest album review... but that's how I feel. Being confronted with such raw beauty so simply presented it overwhelms me. Draws me in like some siren song and makes me ache to get closer to hear more to absorb it all...Seriously I love this album. Not even as much as I love her first album which concerns me because I really love this album.I want to shove her.
simply put this young woman can really belt it out.  But that's not all there is to her latest album.  She is not a shallow performer and doesn't shy away from challenging both her vocal abilities but also the themes in her lyrics.I play this album regularly and I'm old enough to be her grandmother.
I have a lot of respect for Adelle's voice & the music she makes. So young & such a lovely sound!
She has a unique way of phrasing that gives her songs a great style and keeps them interesting.  There are some songs that I could pass on but overall it's a solid album and worth the purchase.
I really am enjoying this cd. I listen to this cd every day on my way to work. Way to go Adele
When I first heard one of Adele's songs I thought it was Amy Winehouse. While similar in some ways Adele is more subdued in her music and singing styles. What an awesome talent.
Great songwriting singing. One of the best albums in recent years. Performed by one of the most talented performers of recent years.
Good album.
This is the best album i've ever listened. El mejor album que he escuchado en toda mi vida . .
It was ok might need to hear it a few more times.  Although I did like 2 songs I think this cd has potential to be an all time fav of mines.
Adele is a very talented artist and I couldn't wait to hear the CD on a high resolution audio system.  Unfortunately I could not believe my ears when I heard it.  This is frankly of of the poorest quality audio recordings I've ever heard.Specifically this CD sounds very digital compressed brilliant edgy and harsh.  This is a result of poor quality recording/mastering and/or production.  With a nice audio system there is practically no sound stage as the music projects from a very small space between the speakers instead of filling the room with music that comes from vocals and instruments clearly identifiable in space between and beyond the speakers.  The lead and background vocals and all instruments project from the same location as if it were recorded in mono instead of stereo.Perhaps there is a different recording or mix than this CD and if so do consider it.  This is great music that should be heard.  Unfortunately this recording is a disappointment.
I don't really know Adele or have read her fan sites or her back story or whatever. Maybe what I'm about to say is totally wrong. But listening to her music one thing is clear to me. Someone out there absolutely shattered this girl's heart into a thousand pieces. And although I truly feel sorry for her that heartbreak has produced some of the best and most passionate music I've heard in quite a while. Her loss our gain.
I'm just adding one more to the hundreds of positive reviews!  I hear something new every time I listen to these amazing songs.  Even my friends who hate everything published in this century like this CD.
What else can one say. This is a great CD. Adele has such a beautiful voice. I can listen to this over and over and want to keep listening to it.
Disk sound is clear. It is easy to see why she stayed at the top of the charts for so long.
this album would have been perfect if the songs were more varied. I listend the first time on a long drive and by the time it ended i was over it. Not the trip the repetiveness of the songs all sounding alike. 1 and 2 are the best tracks.
Only one song on the album I liked.  I love her voice but some of the songs were not quite her caliber.
I purchased this CD for the two mega-hits I recognized.  I had no idea what a great addition this was going to be.  I play it over and over and just can't get enough.Adele's voice has such a richness to it and many of the songs seem to be based on a Native American type of drum beat.  I love to listen to it while working in the kitchen and find myself dancing around and getting exercise while I'm creating or cleaning.  Can't say enough good about this particular CD.  The slow songs tug at your soul and the faster ones move your feet.  A best bet.
"I rarely buy cd's anymore but I fell in love with this one.  I think ""Turning Tables"" is an absolute must.  I also love ""Someone Like You"" ""Rolling in the Deep"" ""Set Fire to the Rain"".  There are just a couple of songs I don't think are great!  I highly recommend Adele 21."
This is the best CD I have purchased in a long time. Not a bad song on it. A couple of the songs are hits but I think there are a few more that could also be hits.
I just love Adele's soulful vibe.  She is in my opinion a great song writer and singer.  If you haven't bought this CD then you need to get it and believe me you won't be disappointed.
Adele is an amazing artist. So Adele plus vinyl is an excellent listening experience. I highly recommend Adele on vinyl!!
I bought this for my husband and I don't think he took it out of rotation in his car for the next month. I had to arm wrestle him or ride in his car to get to play it. AND I have to remind myself that Adele is so young. She writes with a depth well beyond her 21 years. I can only imagine what 31 will be like. Keep writing Adele!
"Here in the United States we have are not in short supply of talent.  However few people from other countries have the power to infiltrate their way into the American music market quite like Adele.  With her smash hit ""Chasing Pavements"" Adele made her way into American ipods.  With ""21"" Adele has continued this trend of actual talent with songs that are dark haunting catchy real and showcase her extraordinary voice that needs no autotune.  The lead single ""Rolling In The Deep"" has a haunting bluesy feel that makes you want to foot tap with its constant baseline.  It has lyrics that can speak to all of us and it never gets old.  My one friend and I can still sing along to this song and we never grow tired of it--even though we have been listening to it ever since it came out.  I absolutely love Adele and all of the other new ""brIT girls"" hitting the American music market and shaking things up with their blue-eyed soul sound.  I would recommend ""21"" to anyone looking for a singer with real talent."
This is a must buy cd. Her voice is so beautiful. I thought I would buy one or two singles from this cd but I listen to the entire cd over and over again.
Wow has she got pipes! Every song is a classic in it's own right. I was shopping at CVS the other day and heard her version of the great Cure song Lovesong.Can't wait for what she comes up with next...hopefully not a cd for children!!
Adele is such a gifted and soulful singer. EVERY song on this CD is wonderful; that almost never happens! Adele's voice and style is very unique and distinctive. I not only purchased the mp3 album but also bought the CD to play in my car. I'm looking forward to future releases from Adele; she's going to be around for a very long time.
There are some really good songs on this CD.  I love Rumor Has It and her acoustic take on the Smith's Lovesong.
Adele is simply an amazing young Singer. I recommend this album to anyone who  truly appreciates real quality music listening.
Adele is the best I have hear in a long time. Great album. I would buy it again in a heart beat.
"Honestly Adele is one of the few truly talented artists nowadays. She is an amazing singer and songwriter whose popularity has grown based on her voice alone. Adele isn't one of those ridiculous pop stars that ""push the envelope"" with outfits and hairstyles in order to get attention. I can't wait for what more Adele will bring us."
Item was packaged securely to insure no breakage took place.  Although it was described as used I had to do a double take because it looked brand new.  No scratches or even finger prints (which drives me NUTS!!) Would recommend highly!
This CD is awesome and comes from one of our greatest new female songsters!  It was birthday gift for my wife and both she and I love it.
Loved the entire CD.  Even if I'd never heard any of her songs before getting this CD I would have loved it after hearing her just once.  What a voice!
Every song is one you will want to listen to again and again. Adele has done it again following up her album 19 with another great success.
Adele has an astonishingly good voice I was hoping that buying this CD would show that but I was left a little disappointed. The vocals are good but lack dynamics throughout most of the songs (it's very obvious in Rolling In The Deep). While that type of thing doesn't annoy me with a-lot of mainstream music it does with hers because of her voice. She needs dynamics and nuance which none of these songs really have...the one exception being Someone Like You which is also my favorite song from the album. The studio engineers crushed most of the dynamics just to make the album sound like today's music which is a huge disappointment for such a great singer.
If you like Adele you will love this album.  This is her first album with many of her most well known songs and you will find yourself belting out the lyrics along with her most especially if you have ever had a love affair gone wrong.
Embarassing to admit I'm one of maybe 17 people on the entire planet who had never heard of Adele until this album came out.  It took exactly one listen of 'Rolling' to turn my head and say 'Whoa who on earth is THAT?'.  I immediately looked her up on Amazon to order her CD only to find she had a previous release.  So I bought both.While '19' is indeed a stellar collection - and I can see exactly why this girl got so much attention with her debut - the performances on '21' are at times absolutely jaw-dropping.  The growth of this artist in just two short years is astonishing ... the warmth and depth of a talented young woman coming into her own.  I've now read some of her earlier reviews from that first release comparing her to Amy Winehouse - whose alma mater she apparently shares - and in listening to '19' I get it.  But when I close my eyes and listen to '21' I hear a mature soulfulness akin to Susan Tedeschi and Macy Gray.  She has heart well beyond her years.Remember when you were a teenager listening to your favourite singer-songwriters: James Taylor The Carpenters Carole King Jackson Browne Jim Croce - remember how their songs seemed to speak to your own emotions?  You'll get that same hit here.  The intimacy of the lyrics coupled with her achingly beautiful delivery can be almost heart-stopping.  I defy you to listen to 'Don't You Remember' or 'Someone Like You' without feeling a little tug on your tearducts.  ;-)
I really enjoyed this album when I first bought it. Since then I've heard most of the songs used in publicity/commercials way more than I prefer. It's sadly spoiled my enjoyment of it.
I picked up a free iTunes download card from Starbucks which was for Adele's Rumor Has It. I fell in love with the gutsy honest singing style she brings forth; at the same time my spouse discovered Rolling In The Deep another honest heartfelt song.I purchased her album 21 and wasn't disappointed. An entire album from this young lady full of honest emotion backed with bluesy music that only adds to her voice never detracts from it.My favorite songs from this album are Rumor Has It Rolling In The Deep and Set Fire To The Rain. I don't skip over any of the other songs but I definitely increase the volume when these play.
Couldn't be better.  Play it in the car to deal with traffic.  Quality voice quality selection of material.  Just good all the way around.
This is a great CD for anyone! Great to give as a gift or purchase for yourself to listen to over and over!
I LOVE Adele and I have her cd's i listen on the internet but listening to her on vinyl is absolutely a great experience! The record was brand new and delivered in perfect condition!
What a beautiful song bird. She is such a great artist whom I adore. She feels down home to me. I like playing this CD.
Adele is a great singer and I enjoyed every song on this CD.  Her voice is beautiful and her songs have a great beat and good lyrics.
"The first time I heard ""Rolling the Deep"" I loved it already but after hearing her 2nd single ""Someone like You"" I had to buy her cd. Just like any other cd that I'm excited to hear I played right away as soon as I got it. All of her songs are all different in many ways.I really love ""Rumor has it"" because it has a rock feel to it but once I heard ""Set fire to the rain"" it easily reminded me of ""Pride in the name of Love"" and ""Beautiful Day"". And am not suprised to hear ""Set fire to the rain"" as the latest single from her. Adelle is a breath of fresh air muscially and and so much talent. Her voice is very rare and unique and also reminds me of being the daughter of someone from the 50's and 60's blues sound...."
"I love Adele's voice but was expecting more from this album.  Don't care too much about the hit ""Roling in the deep"" so I was hoping the other songs would save the album.  In my opinion they don't.  Some are really annoying with repetitive choruses like ""Rumour has it"". :("
I like this CD a lot more than I thought I would. I bought it for my wife and very quickly grew to like much of it.But... Seriously? You take a fine talent good heart wrenching tunes and mix it and master it like amateurs.Brick-wall mastering is never tollerable but one can almost forgive it on Green Day Rancid Spinnerett CD's but Adele? Come on!! This is sad and pathetic. The opening track is clipped and harsh almost to the point of un-listenabiltiy. These songs and this woman deserves better. Putting out a CD with shoddy production values doesn't help anyone.But fortunately this album has succeded in spite of it's ridiculous lack of dynamics and hyper compressed and 'Loudness Wars' mastering.Adele does not have a voice like Ella. That's a given it's raspy and raw but it's emotional and emotive. It works. I like it. I like the manner in which she performs her songs. The arrangements are mostly good though a couple verge on the derivitive side of pop... or R&B.;I hope the Vynil LP is better... I'm planning to get it. At least they can't 'brick wall' it... though it too can be mastered poorly.EDIT:  I received the Vinyl LP and ripped it at 24bit/96khz. The sonics and dynamics are far superior to the CD. Some songs are better than others. Set Fire to the Rain is similar because of the pre-mastering which killed all the dynamics and flattened it to one volume. Running in the Deep is a revelation as it was not mastered to 'brick' form and has very good dynamic bandwidth. The difference is truly night and day on some songs like that one.That said what the LP has allowed me to do is see how poorly several of these songs are recorded and mixed and pre-mastered. Some are produced very well and others are amateurish and pathetic. But only the LP will allow you to truly hear Adele and only on about half the songs. This is quite a disservice to her the songs and the musicians who played on this album. Hey Adele find the better producer and use that person for the entire album. That way you won't have such a hodge-podge of variations from song to song and your talent won't be overshadowed by pathetic production values.
I Love this entire CD. She has such talent and promise.Her songs come straight from the heart and soul.Buy it! You will love it too!
I most of the songs sound good. Some songs made me go eh and some I said I really like this. The MAJOR thing I have a problem with is the production and the way she sings. Live she is so amazing but its like they dont want her to sound good. Listen to Someone like you and Take it All live and you see its puts the studio version to shame. Its okay to sing better live there are lots of singers in their prime that sounded better than the studo like whitney and mariah but some of adeles studio version just make me cringe. Am I the only one?
I like this cd it is just what i was expecting came to me on time with no problems price was good I would buy from this seller again thanks so much
Don't bother buying this cd because anytime you turn on any radio station you hear one of her annoying songs with her screechy voice. I wish I could rate this 0 stars.
SHE IS BLESSED WITH A VOICE THAT CAN PROBABLY SING ANYTHING- OR AS RANDY JACKSON LIKES TO SAY- SHE COULD SANG THE PHONEBOOK  AND MAKE EVERYONE WANT TO GO BUY A COPY.
I love this CD. It took me a while to decide who she reminds me of. This CD is great for listening & good for dancing also.I purchased my CD from Amazon along with other popular CD's that have been winners.
"I am an Adele fan and I have enjoyed her music from day one. 21 is a great followup album to 19. Her vocal styling is showcased as always and she gives us I do enjoy it when she incorporates her own interpretations of well known songs like she did before with Dylan's ""To Make You Feel My Love"" and this time around it is ""Lovesong"" I appreciate artists writing what they know and at 21 Adele knows a thing or two about heartbreak and regret but not in an overly melancholic way. Some of my stand out faves are He Won't Go Lovesong and Someone Like You."
I wish I could sing like that.  Barbara Streisand of today.  Love listening to her torch songs while driving.  This girl is here for the long term.
"Many times a new artist bursts on the scene and receives accolades that are unwarranted because of the artist's uniqueness in a field that is dominated by sameness.  These new performers are placed on musical pedestals that make them hard to maintain their balance and find themselves soon falling from that position because of critics' and fans' quickly changing tastes.That should not happen to Adele because not only is see fresh she has the pipes and the songwriting skills to endure a lengthy and profitable career as a star in music.""21"" is like Carol King's ""Tapestry"" an album that showcases a singer's voice and exemplary songwriting skills for not only does Adele demonstrate her distinctively soulful voice but co-wrote each of the disc's 11 songs.To single out any songs as standouts is not fair to those omitted; thus all of the songs are recommended listening for they show the diversity of Adele a singer who can punch out a rocker with the same ease that she does a plaintive ballad.On Grammy night in February there will be no surprise when the English lass takes home a boatload of awards."
&#34;Rumor Has IT&#34;  that this CD is a great!! ...Well I have news for you it's not a rumor...this CD does not disappoint.
Love this CD from Adele - ALL the songs are great.  Willdefinitely purchase more Adele cds.  She has such a unique voice - love it!!
I have played this CD so many times I really like Adele and this CD is one of her best thoroughly recommend it.
I love this CD even more than Adele 19.  Wish the new James Bond &#34;Skyfall&#34; was on this CD.  Maybe on the next CD. I love that song too. Just wanted to get it on a CD with other songs.
A 2-dimensional recording of a 3-dimensional artist.It's Carnegie Hall ... the microphone is 1 inch from Adele ...From 40 rows back ... after her voice had a chance to really open up ... this would have been ... just astonishing.Instead the recording is BRIGHT and the sound stage is shallow.
I just love this CD.  I don't buy very many CD's.  Now with I-tunes I buy even fewer but I heard how good this CD was and felt I had to try it and I am very glad I did.  After a year of owning it I still listen to it.  I recommend it to anyone thinking of buying it.
I have to be honest.  I have the CD which I love so didn't open the record. I am keeping for collecting. Adele is one of only modern artists that I have really gotten into so seemed right to get the vinyl to add to my 9000 collection! A bit more expensive then what I usually find at thrift stores or estate sales but still worth it!
This woman's voice really touches your soul. Her writing stays with you long after the record stops playing. Buy it and you'll play it often.Sound recording quality is top notch. Vinyl version is quiet as a mouse. Very pleased to make this purchase and recommend it all of my audiophile and music loving friends.
Every song touches a piece of my heart and soul.Adele can lift you when your down or the music can just guide you through the tuff times.
This was my first experience with Amazon. Com. It took longer to receive the product than expected.  When I finally received the cd it was scratched!!  Very dissapointed!  It was a Christmas present for my husband I was embarrassed that it skipped because of the scratch!  I was going to send it back but it came from the UK!!!! Really!  Kinda expensive to send back'bn
"as usual adele does not disappoint!  this album is beautifully written orchestrated and delivered from beginning to end!  it's almost hard to believe that it is performed by someone so young!  highlights  include the retro-styled ""rumor has it"" a genius cover of the cure's ""lovesong"" and of course the brilliant ""someone like you."""
"I'm a huge hard rock guy that likes bands like Staind Korn Limp Bizkit etc. However I do appreciate pure amazing talent in other music genres. I first heard ""Chasing Pavements"" from Adele's previous album and knew she was extremely talented. Her first album was great. Then this album came out and basically you never know. For example I thought Norah Jones first album was incredible as well but I was not as impressed with her second. This album 21 is great from start to finish. It starts with the popular song ""Rolling In The Deep"" and ends with ""Someone Like You"". (Billboard reported that Adele's ""Someone Like You"" which is currently the number one song on the Hot 100 is the first ballad to sit atop that list in over three years. - Music Mix). Simply that means the general public that loves poppy rock or dance music is appreciating her simple ballad! That says a lot! Plus I'm a big fan of CDs still too. MP3s are OK but if you have a nice stereo at home buy the CD and you will be rewarded!"
bought this when it first came out.  I thought I had already reviewed.  She's great.  beautiful voice and spirit.  Yay
I had purchased this cd for a friend who is crazy about Adele. I  myself have heard the cd and give it a favorable review. Some of the songs will take some getting used to. I guess if you play music enough you grow to like it...
"I have never heard of Adele before until about 2 months ago some links on facebook friend posts were appearing.  I liked what I heard and had to get the CD.  Overall excellent CD.  I also Ordered Adele ""19"" but do much prefer ""21"" over ""19"".  Her voice and style is truly unique."
"I enjoyed the album. I tried to listen to it straight through while driving one day and while I really loved Rolling in the Deep and Set Fire to the Rain I didn't LOVE the rest of the album. Part of it was I discovered later... a little Adele goes a long way with me. The album started to blur the songs were running together a lot. By the end of the fourth song I was thinking ""Has this woman NEVER had a relationship that worked?"" By the end of the ""Set Fire to the Rain"" as much as I loved the song I was ready to break up with her... and there were six more songs. I don't want to spoil it for anybody but she's not happy in any of them either. She's in love during ""Lovesong"" which is awesome! And she's talking about him in the present tense so he doesn't appear to have vanished in the night... but she still sounds melancholy... It was just too much sadness. I felt like I was in a smoky bar and she was leaning on the piano singing while holding a tall drink in one hand and looking bored while her piano player smoked a cigarette and played on into the early hours of the morning and people sat at a bar drinking trying to forget. It captured that feeling perfectly for me.Put her on shuffle with some other songs something with a bpm higher than a yogi's pulse for example and she's much better. She shines when contrasted with other stuff. Too much of her at once was a lot. But mixed with other stuff I really liked it."
A masterpiece by Adele (21).  A vocal tour de force that combines the power of K D Lang the soulful-blues of Bonnie Raitt and the emotional heartbreak of Janis Joplin.  An album with great songs that I believe rivals the best of singer-songwriters since the '70s.  The Grammy might as well give her best album of the year now.  Adele has blown away any competition from Lady Gaga Katy Perry or Beyonce.Two of my favorite songs Rumour Has It and Turning Tables were co-written by One Republic's lead singer Ryan Tedder.  For me a nice surprise from another fav group.  Rumour Has It is a blast on a big sound system and should make the club scene.  While Rolling in the Deep has become a big hit it does share similar DNA to KT Tunstall's Black Horse and the Cherry Tree (which is a very good thing).  The remaining songs are stunningly intimate.Adele has brought back to the pop music scene the vocalist who can stand alone in front of a microphone without having 100 dancers in the background and electrify the audience.  Wow!
Pretty face pretty songs. Love to hear her voice singing. It only took me 10 seconds to be captivated by this wonderful album.
thank you i am enjoying the item it has come time for all good men to come together it rains mainly in spain where they speak spanishAND THIS TWENTY WORD REQUIREMENT SUCK.. YOU NEED TO CHANGE OR PEOPLE WILL NOT FILL OUT THE REVIEWS THUS HURTING THE SELLER OF ANOTHER GOOD REVIEW
Adele never disappoints! Great mix of spunky and haunting sounds that only Adele can bring. Would definitely recommend.Great album!
Great CD. Had never heard her belore getting this CD but it was recommeded by a friend. Did I mention great CD.
This girl has a very distinctive and beautiful voice and a unique style. I decided to get the vinyl and when I opened it I was surprised to find the code to download the mp3 version from the Adele.tv site inside the package so now I can hear the LP in my turntable at home and take the whole album with me anywhere else. Very pleased.
Absolutely love the WHOLE entire CD. Can listen to it all the way through. Most definitely recommend it! her voice fits all ranges of emotions you can listen this when you are happy sad angry or just chill. I am going to buy her other albums because of this one.
"Adele's always been an ok singer nothing to spectacular. I was never really a fan of her first album 19 but I did like the song ""Rolling In Deep"". I also really like the indie/down home style of the videos and songs. I decided to buy the album. While it's not my favorite album it's propably the best pop album of the year. It's classy yet catchy and cute. Rumor has it is a great throw back jam and It reminds me of something I'd hear on an oldies radio station. The fact that Adele is singing and writing her own music scores points in my book. Fire in The Rain is my favorite track; I more like the piano melody more than anything else (I think most people will enjoy that track). People should defiantly buy and support this album; people will enjoy it."
This was a Christmas gift for my 55 year old sister who was very glad to get it. She doesn't like downloaded music and appreciated the CD and has put it into her car for many hours of enjoyment.
Adele truly has a beautiful voice. I think so many singers today are 'hits' because of their (well chosen) hit songs with all the music to back them up. Adele can sing flawlessly with just a piano playing or with NO musical backup and it's beautiful!
this disc is absolutley stunning in every way! adele has an amazing voice and writes some beautiful songs.you can't go wrong with this cd I highly recommend it.not one bad track on here well worth the money.
It is hard to find &#34;newer&#34; music on vinyl.  This is one of my favorites to play.  I prefer side A over side B but I enjoy listening to the whole thing.  Adele is just awesome!
This young lady can sing love her gritty sound the words and she is refreshingly not a common everyday singer.
Adele delivers on this CD.  My preference is oldies rock and roll music but I believe in being open to hearing new music.It is such a pleasure to listen to this album.
For a new singershe sure You wont go wrong.can belt them out.I found a few good songs on this cd.
Best album so far . Must buy the new CD/DVD .  Great music by a great arist. Waiting for her next compilation already.
I would recommend this product to all my friends and relatives.  I will continue to purchase merchandise from your company.
Just give her the Lifetime Grammy now! Having the top selling album for this long deserves something! Would it have worked in any other decade?
"I love this new album by Adele.  She is twenty-two but the way she conveys a wisdom far beyond her years when she sings.My favorite track is ""One and Only"".  This is a soulful love song that touches me personally.  I yearn for a love that Adele describes on this song ""Turning Tables"" is a song about a conflict between two people.  This song is about trying not to get hurt emotionally.  The piano playing sounds good on this track.  ""Rolling In The Deep"" and ""Rumor Has It"" are two tracks with an excellent drum beat.  These songs are good songs to move to.  Adele covers the classic song ""Lovesong"". The guitar playing is beautiful on this track. Adele's vocals are very soothing on this song.  ""He Won't Go"" is a smooth groove jam of a song.  ""Someone Like You"" is a song about trying move after breaking up with someone.  This song has a positive spirit about relationships.  There is a maturity in Adele's voice.  It comes through clearly on this track. ""Set Fire To The Rain"" is a song with a dramatic quality. I like the image of fire and rain this song creates in my mind.  I like the sentiment of the song ""Do You Remember"".  This song makes me reflect on the women I used to have feelings for. I enjoy the music on this album very much."
There's so much weak music these days - to my ear but this CD is super.  You will be hearing several of these songs on the radio for months and they/she deverves that exposure.  They are pop-y but also soulful.  Get this one!
Rolling in the Deep is a great song and there is no disputing Adele has a wonderful voice.  Unfortunately the sound qualityof this CD is compressed shallow and just bad. Listen to the CD on a inexpensive radio or cheap ear plugs and it won't make a difference.  Another example of the negative results of digital recording.
This CD is awesome.What a talent this lady is.I love her voice.I play this CD all day long.The whole CD is greatRolling In The Deep being one of my faves.Arrived on time and in great condition.Buy this CD really terrific.
Once in our lifetime we have a singer who comes along who can sing the emotions we have buried deep inside.  We turn up the song and suddenly we're laughing and crying all the same time because we can finally express those feelings that express our humanity in all its naked glory.Adele is the kind of singer who through grappling her way through her own pain and despair sings it out loud and clear for us all to join in almost relishing the worst pain of our lives because getting it out feels so good.  Adele carries us along on that great big beautiful voice of hers that aches with emotion and soars to the heavens allowing us a glimpse of what it feels to be totally in the moment of a great passion.  Adele doesn't need any whistles and bells no voice enhancement no dancing and pyrotechnics to distract us from what's really important about music and what music can do for us which is that it allows us to feel.The fact that Adele writes her own songs I find astounding. I can't name one other singer's singer who also writes songs any singer would give up their first-born to be allowed to sing.  Sure we have great writers Dylan the Beatles Lenoard Cohen Neil Young and songwriting teams from the past that have written classic songs for great singers like Streisand Celine and dozens of others but to have both of these gifts in one package is mind-boggling.Adele's great ballad(Someone Like You) dedicated to a guy who dumped her probably saying he wasn't ready for get serious and then finding out he's now married speaks to all of us.  Who doesn't have someone who taught us that a heart can truly feel like it's breaking?  Who hasn't wanted to yell at that person warning them 'don't underestimate the things that I will do'?I had previously warn out Adele's first album (19) and was anxiously awaiting her second but as much as I enjoyed her first album I couldn't have imagined that she'd outdo herself so thoroughly.  I can only imagine what her ex-lover put her through to inspire her to write such heartbreakingly beautiful songs.  I don't know whether to thank him or hit him for putting her through all that pain.This album is already in my top-ten favorites of all time.  True genius in both writing and vocal ability.
Adele has a beautiful voice. Rich smoky and the music is well orchestrated. Sound quality was great. I would recommend this to anyone who likes blues or soul music
Every song on this cd is a hit. This young lady is what music is all about. Such power! Love her to pieces!
Quality CD and the price was right. Bought this before she won all of her awards and when she did I understood why and was happy for her.
Not having heard a lot of Adele I took a punt because I liked her 'style'. Mostly because it was not like the many other female performers her age...all doing the same stuff..boring and not my taste. I was pleased to find that my punt was a good one. This is great album..even for us oldies (over 40s!) Her music is beyond her years and very addictive....love it!. I am a new fan! Dont change a thing!
"De tanto ouvir falar da tal Adele inclusive da imprensa especializada que vem ""endeusando"" a cantora resolvi escutar algumas m&uacute;sicas desse disco e para minha surpresa eram as mesmas m&uacute;sicas da trilha sonora da novela da r&aacute;dio AM. Quando li as resenhas dos cr&iacute;ticos achei que ela fazia parte dessa nova gerao de artistas neo soul que ali&aacute;s &eacute; muito boa mas ao ouvir as m&uacute;sicas no encontrei o tal neo soul que imaginei apenas canes pop e nada mais. Mesmo assim continuei no compreendendo tanto barulho por nada ento resolvi ler as letras das canes uau! algu&eacute;m fez muito mal para essa moa! e o pior ela no compreendeu que o cara no quer nada com ela e quer acabar com a vida dele!!! Talvez seja esse o motivo de ser to adorada e sucesso de vendas o neg&oacute;cio &eacute; se vingar! Viva o Tarantino! Mas sei l&aacute; entende?"
I've always thought UK singers had dynamic voices Adele continues the trend with her '21' album.  The rhythms modulations and poetic lyrics -- simply phenomenal.  Adele is not some painted pop culture mold like many American stars tend to be.  Instead she's without question has sealed legacy as a terrific singer and songwriter that has built the bridges to make hers one of pop's greatest voices.  I appreciate every song on this album not one song is disliked.  Seriously people if you are thirsty for real music don't miss out here Adele is the real deal!
Love the Album.  I'm glad I purchased it.  The songs are awesome.  I am looking forward to her next album.
WHAT A VOICE THIS YOUNG LADY HAS. I COULD SIT AND LISTEN TO HER FOR HOURS. I CANNOT GET ENOUGH OF ADELE.
This is an awesome album.  Every song is very different.  But my favorite is lovesong.  Her voice use very special
"It's been a while since I got this record and I have to say .... it's perfection!There are albums that come along like Fleetwood Mac's ""Rummors"" that every cut is just fantastic.This record is that.  I love it.  I play it all the time."
This is about the only CD I have ever bought that I like all the songs on it. Well worth the money for me.
the CD was great that's why I wanted it but it arrived with a cracked case although listed in good condition did not arrive that way but the CD played.
I loved the songs Rolling in the Deep Set Fire To The Rain andespecially Someone Like You which makes me cry when I hearit. Adele has such a beautiful voice that I never heard beforeI see why she won grammys and sold millions of records.
Best blues and pop singer ever! I love her music and the sound of her voice it's so perfect I can hear her all day
her best work yet and would recommend it to anyone who likes Adele worth the money since every song Is good
What can you say of this great artist whose voice leaves you in awe of her persona.Her lyrics her timing the sounds are beyond measure.  I truly great voice coming from a person who's humble and sweet.
TO listen to Adele sing her well chosen lyrics with such a masterful voice at such a young age brings shivers to my body!
It is an awesome album! Adele is awesome! I am now enjoying it in my Kindle.where ever I am. yehey!
Absolutely the best money ever spent. If I could give this 10 stars I would.Love every track. It's music at it's finest. Pure and refined.
This cd makes you dance.  I love the uniqueness of the songs and styles of the music on the cd.
She has done it again with her second album and all the new songs.  She will sure go along time and as she gets more reviews and more people hear her songs they will feel like I do a great sanger.
I bought this based on the Amazon reviews. I'm usually disappointed when I buy a cd from one of the new artists but this cd which is her second is strong throughout. Well written tunes simple arrangements not over produced like so much of the crappy music these days and this young woman can really sing. She does cool things with her voice without over signing like so many of the over-hyped singers these days and she has soul. I finally got to see her perform on TV one song on Dancing With The Stars and she is a brilliant live performer. The best videos on youtube are the live ones from Jools Hollanders Late Nite show amazing. On her first CD 19 her phrasing and style is a bit all over the place obviously trying to find her own style and copying others but the album is good. On this her second album 21 she stamps out her own indelible style and it is distinctly Adele. I've had the cd a couple of months now and I never tire of listening to it. All the songs are about a relationship and they are gut wrenching and passionate with strong lyrics. Adele is the real deal; a very good song writer and a great soulful singer. This is one of the best albums in years by any performer and Adele is the number one selling recording artist in the world. As of this update on June 27 2011 this cd has been number 1 on the global charts for 16 weeks this year. It has sold over 7 million copies (digital and hard copy). If you are a romantic or have ever been in love you will relate to these songs.
"One thing I hate about Adele is the ease at which she can sing. When I first heard of her in 2008 after her appearance on SNL I immediately fell in love. It amazes me how someone I don't know makes it seem otherwise. Her music is in short brilliance. Whether it be an upbeat song or her marvelous ballads her powerhouse voice gravitates you. I was able to get an advance copy of ""21"" and in all honesty can say I have heard it every single day for the past 2 months.  While ""19"" is about falling in love ""21"" is about breaking up; the process by which it happens how it happens and eventually coming to terms with the breakup and forgiving the other person wishing them luck.Kicking off the album is ""Rolling in the Deep"" a sort of F--- You to an ex. Those of us who have had breakups need an ""I'm going to be alright without you"" anthem- this is it.""Rumor Has It"" feeds off of the energy ""Rolling in the Deep"" provides. This song screams ""You'll never find someone like me- I'm the best thing that has ever/will happen to you- Your loss!""""Turning Tables"" is the part of the breakup when you step back and say ""Whoa what just happened?"" It talks about being unhappy and finding the courage to say ""Ok maybe breaking up is the best thing.""""Don't You Remember"" deals about a breakup so sudden so out of left field you don't know what hit you; Out of nowhere your partner bails on you. It talks about dealing with the devastation because you don't know what you did wrong. It's a plea to your partner to stay.""When will I see you again? You left with no goodbye not a single word was said. No final kiss to seal any sins."" This is one of my favorites off of the album.Adele calls ""Set Fire to the Rain"" a gay anthem as she wrote it for her friend. It speaks of that person you let in that eventually failed you. They toy with your emotions after you exposed yourself completely to them. One thing that disappoints me about this song is that the live arrangement for it is SO much better than the studio version as is the case with ""Someone Like You.""""He Won't Go"" speaks vulnerability- feeling helpless about moving on from a toxic relationship.""Take it All"" expresses the frustration of giving your ""everything"" to someone but it just isn't enough.""One and Only""= Asking your partner to let go of your past and asking to allow you to be the only one.""Lovesong"" is a Cure cover. Originally rearranged for Barbra Streisand for a project that never developed.""Someone Like You"" has got to be my FAVORITE song on the album. It talks about looking back on that one person that got away. The relationship in question had the wrong timing so it never worked out. Now that someone has moved on they're settled and you allow yourself to be happy for them even if it hurts because you love them so much.I will admit I cried when I first heard this album in its entirety. The realness behind it is un-denying. Buy this album and won't help but adore it."
I loved Adele's first album but very disappointed in the new one. Some songs are just hard on the ears as wonderful as she sings. I usually wait to buy until I can listen to samples but there were none on a preorder and figuring this album would be as great. Not so for me... Yet her concert is sold out in Seattle in a day???
How could you ever go wrong with Adele? Her voice is so rich and soulful sounds we need more of! Love her to bits.
It sure is a winning album. You will enjoy all tracks with nothing to spare. Adele has such a given one of a kind voice and was saved for as to enjoy listenning.
This is a great collection of songs by a very talented performer. I'm looking forward to enjoying Adele for years.
I wasn't much of a fan of Adele's at first but after listening to this cd I loved each and every song in this cd.
"The slow-roasting success of singer/songwriter Adele continues ascendance on ""21"" which shows marked growth from her debut ""19."" While it lacks a single as radio-friendly as that album's ""Chasing Pavements"" ""21"" has an overall stronger song selection and finds the British songstress taking more chances.The majority of the songs don't call attention to themselves and the lyrical content is about as insightful as can be expected from a young woman still in the flush of youth with a few strong exceptions. She oozes just as much cool as ardent longing in her alluring immediately ingratiating voice however giving even weaker songs clout and panache. This allows her to carve out a rich caffeinated niche for herself in spite of the fact most of the songs themselves are not particularly impressive.Going against the grain of the percussive tension-bearing lead single ""Rolling in the Deep"" ""21"" plays as a subdued often elegant set of songs ideal for coffee shops and drives home after work despite the forthright instrumentation and vocal delivery. The witty meditative ""Rumour Has It"" and ""He Won't Go"" command the most notice in terms of sheer grandiosity and memorable pop hooks and are just as strong as ""Rolling in the Deep.""""Don't You Remember"" showcases Adele's weaknesses instead of her strengths. The melody is scattered and focus-less and her vocals are off-pitch and stretched painfully beyond their limits. ""Set Fire to the Rain"" which immediately follows does the opposite. The melody bubbles over like a furious river in the middle of an arid desert. The production as with most of the album is too even-handed but the song remains uplifting and nothing short of inspired showing the best of what can result from Adele's considerable vocal talent.Stark piano ballads ""Turning Tables"" and ""Someone Like You"" anchor the album. Their lyrical content brooding melodies and sincere vocals quietly underscore that her talent has accrued interest in the years between records.Adele seems destined to craft better records in the future but ""21"" is a step in the right direction."
My granddaughter introduced me to Adele's music and I really liked what I heard so I decided I needed my own CD rather than borrow from my granddaughter. Terrific!
I was only a casual fan and enjoyed hearing her on the radio before I purchased this record.  She is truly incredible and it sounds amazing on vinyl.  I would recommend this record for any fan of folk blues or soul.  She is a good blend of it all.Love it!
My Mother loved this as her Christmas present. It arrived quickley. She was very excited this is exactly what she asked for!
Every song on this album is a winner . Adele deserves all of the awards she has received. I play this CD in my car all day long.
Adele is outrageously talented.  ADELE 21 has all of her current well known hit songs that are great.  The other more unknown songs are also great.  Not to be missed.
"I've listened to this album over and over and still love it! Adele has a great voice and her song selections are fabulous! She also has a terrific band behind her.  I'm hoping it won't be too long before she does some more recording. I would add however that as much as I love this album I don't care for her song selections on her album ""19""."
This is great music - clear concise heartfely and sang with passion.  Love the rhythm of the first couple of songs.  I ahd never listened to this lady before until I previewed it on Amazon.  I would love to see her in person..
I love Adele and her music! This CD was worth the money! So much heart and emotion poured into one disc!Shame on the man that left her! Your loss buddy!
Love Adele and her style of music. She sings from the heart-usually a broken heart but it's real. I listen to her music over and over.
So enjoyable to listen to. Her songs are unique. It is nice to understand the words to her songs and not hear screeching.
I love this album. It's the first entire album I've bought in years. I love each song. Of course the hot pop songs are great but it's rare to like every song on an entire album. I'm anxious for her next album!
"While ""Rolling in the Deep"" is the track you'll probably recognize most readily I like ""Set Fire to the Rain"" and ""One and Only"" just as well.Really good music.  Adele is a great talent with a rich and evocative voice.  You'll find yourself belting out the lyrics with her even at stoplights where everyone can see you!"
Very happy with this cd.  Every song is a winner.  A bit more mellow than I expected but still beautifully sang and written.  Arrival took a little longer than I hoped but just what I was told and expected.
"This album is amazing. Adele is amazing. Her lyrics her singing her everything. Not one song in this cd is bad each song in it's own right is perfect. Her voice is earth shatteringly good. Mind you though the one song in this cd that i cannot give enough of and i cannot cry whenever i listen to it is "" SOMEONE LIKE YOU"". WOW! You can feel her pain and her words ring true within each note that she sings. It's everything i hope for it to be and much more.THIS BETTER GET A GRAMMY NOMINATION FOR 2012."
Love the CD all songs are great. Listen to the CD at work and now everyone wants to borrow it.
In a world of pop crap and a lack of talent Adele is so refreshing. This album fed my need for soulful ballots and hot upbeat songs to dance around the house to. I love Adele her voice and style don't center on the vulgarity and hyper-sexualized anything to sell an album nature that is now predominate in much of today's music.
I purchased two of these one for my daughter for christmas and one for myself on her recommendation.  Adele has a beautiful voice and each song is enjoyable.
This is an awesome awesome album. Adele's voice is so beautiful and the songs are so different from each other. For the last month I have played this cd on repeat in my truck without getting bored.
One of my favorites - great songs.  This is one of her best.  She is turning out to be one of my favorite singers
I listen and re listen to Adele. I so enjoy her voice and its passion. She is like a torch singer but for our age and I don't have to worry that I may see her half naked in her youtube videos.
Adele what a strong voice. She has so many hits on this it's a great CD you'll love it. I did
I love Adele.  Can't think of anything more to say will deffintely download more of her music.  I Love Her
I am a new fan. I loved the whole CD. This will definitely go with my favorites. Looking forward to more!!
THE best new album I've heard in a long time!  Some of her songs stick in my mind all day.  I chose this as a Christmas gift for a group of friends.  Everyone should experience Adele 21. Adele 19 is just as creative.
I thought this cd was fantastic. Adele has a beautiful voice and I could listen to it all day.  She is fantastic.
I LOVE this CD. Adele is amazing and I always enjoy her music. It makes for really nice dinner background music as well.
I listen to this often it is a lovely cd with all of my favorites. I expect to listen for years to come with pleasure.
What more can I say? Her voice is mesmorizing! I love the convenience of buying the whole mp3 album from the convenience of home!
Great album! Beautiful voice and music with a bluegrass and blues feel. Bought it for my mom and fell in love with it myself.
I love love love adele. I love her and her music so much I wanted to name my daughter Adele but my husband was a no go on that! I feel better after listening to her music and it is very soothing.
"Did not care much for Adele when she started becoming the ""it"" girl in 2011 and then she released the single ""Someone Like You"" and I became an instant fan. I bought this CD along with her first Album ""19"" not knowing what I would expect and she does not disappoint; the music is well put together but the main instrument (Adele herself) simply blows you away from start to finish. I can see myself listening to this CD for years to come and not getting bored. I will review her first album 19 on a separate post along with her concert DVD ""live at the Royal Albert Hall""; both of which are also a 'must have' for any Adele fan or any other music lover who is tired of the ""junk"" that is currently out there disguised as music."
It is Adele. What else is there to say. Her voice is angelic. The lyrics are magical. A true talent!
Have had it in the CD player in my car since it arrived. Her voice evokes an emotional response. Wonderful!
This was the best birthday gift I had received in a long time. I love her voice and the songs just say exactly what I am feeling.
and I love Amazon's Cloud feature. I have a Kindle and I have access to ALL of the music I have ever ordered from Amazon so not only did I get a great CD but it was automatically downloaded to my computer and Kindle too!
Album is good no issue with that but she just stands and sings and is overrated. Making her out to be a goddess but just a regular singer.
Adele has such a powerful voice tone & range that just penetrates a listeners inner soul. I was mainly interested in 3 or 4 songs in this album( Set Fire To The Rain Rumor Has It Rolling in The Deep & Someone like You) but loved the whole set once I Iistened to the whole album. I'll put her other albums on my wish list for future purchases. She is a great talent!
My wife and  kids love this disc.  We have listened to it in the car many times.  Very strong disc as the awards would indicate.
"I had purchased Adele's 19 album because of all the hype it received and I wasn't all that taken with it.  So I was surprised to learn that ""Rolling in the Deep"" that I really liked hearing on the radio was by the same artist.  Overall I have to say I like this album a lot more.  Along with ""Rolling in the Deep"" I am quite smitten with ""Rumor has it"" (The first and second tracks).  I have to say that now I am looking forward to whatever Adele does next."
What can I say? Adele is one of the most talented singers and songwriters to come along in a LONG while. LOVE this album!
Beautiful and lyrical album from Adele you can't go wrong with this CD I highly recommend trying it out if you like the popular songs on this album.
Absolutely went to the top of my list for album of the year.  The real gem on this CD is Set Fire to the Rain an absolute powerhouse of a song that just builds and builds with true passion.  But there are lots of great songs that really have a nice backbeat.  I really enjoyed the various arrangements in the songs lots of variety makes for a refreshing intriguing listen over and over.  Her voice is unique almost smoky and with some wonderful range just when you don't expect it.  Some of the songs really bring out the very best in her voice.  This CD is this year's no-brainer.  Pick it up!
Had to have this one I love adele and had to have this for my collection would recommend it to anyone
wish I hadnt bought this CD its running into the ground on radio and TV I dont need one!Too Bad for Me. Even the music shows are running it into the ground.
It's rare that I find a CD where all of the songs are great this is the one! I love this CD great purchase!!
I simply love this CD the best I have purchased so far this year.  Adele once again brings a soulful and refreshing sound to the airwaves.  A must have if you enjoy music.
Bought this album based on several excellent reviews.  The performance is fine. The sonic quality is very... electronic.  Was this album mastered for ear-buds or i-pods?
Stunning voice beautiful songs!
The greatest female vocalist in history. This album never gets old and I can not wait for her next album.
Adele has a great CD.  I love every song on it.  I look forward to more music from her.  Thanks
"Adele lured listeners in with her 2008 hit ""Chasing Pavements"". Her debut album ""19"" fell flat for me as it seemed to be singing the blues over and over again about being a teenager. In 2010 she reappeared with a new smash hit ""Rolling in the Deep"" and the release of ""21"" which was her age at the time of the recording sessions. I did not expect ""Rolling in the Deep"" or ""21"" to be the successes they are as ""21"" has exceeded 15 million copies sold and ""Rolling in the Deep"" was named song of the year by Billboard magazine. All of this hype surrounding this production might seem to make this album just that all hype but no quality. Fortunately nothing could be further from the truth. Adele was 21 but her song-writing and vocals say otherwise. She can not help but seem wise far beyond her years as she delivers beautifully in ""Love Song"" and ""Don't You Remember"". In ""19"" Adele seemed to be stuck in a ho-hum bluesy sound but ""21"" changes that and becomes more accessible to audiences worldwide. Pop-lovers will sing away during songs such as ""Set fire to the rain"" and ""Rumour Has It"" while those interested in soul will certainly love ""I'll be waiting"" and ""Take it all"". Even better the producers of this album has simply outdone themselves as they show less is more and the let you know there is no auto-tune or any voice-altering device here. What you are hearing is the true genuine Adele and when you listen through one of her near six minute songs all the way through you'll be amazed how much worth while the experience was."
i bought this album..i only like 2 songs..the rest are just boring..when i listen to the album i tend to fall asleep..it is soo boring..this album is the worst album ever..in my opinion..im not loving adele..im not a hateri just dont see what the big deal is about her..her voice isnt all that..matter fact i find her voice annoying..there are better artist out there with better voices..Like Leona Lewis etc..bottom line is that i dont like her music..her music is just boring
Adele's beautiful singing voice makes me sing and I don't do that everyday especially with my singing voice. Great album!
"Adele is amazing! I can listen to this cd over and over again. Her voice is so soulful and pure. Many of the songs have the ""forlorn lover"" vibe which I usually find to be depressing but these songs are so beautifully done that I find myself wanting more. Whatever fueled her fire for this album I hope she can channel it again in the future. The only aspect of this album I am not wild about is her rendition of Lovesong but the rest of the album more than makes up for it! I highly recommend this album!"
This is a must have for people that love Adele!!!! Will look for more of her newer CDs in the future
I've been trying to cancel this but with no success.  Please cancel this.  Thank you.  I wanted the CD to play in my car.  I would like to exchange it for the CD.  I didn't realize I was clicking the download.  Please correct this.  I haven't downloaded it.  Thanks.
Good songs lots of different types of songs on this one.  Beautiful voice.  I listen to it in the car.
I have played this one over and over and the familiar tunes tend to stay with you even when you aren't thinking of them. Still one ot the best albums I own..
"I love Adele's ""21"" album. It is right up there with the new album by Lovari called ""No Holding Back"" as my two favorties so far this year. http://www.amazon.com/No-Holding-Back/dp/B00860R7XY/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1339653627&sr=301-1"
What can I say?? A great artist with a great voice. What a pleasant surprise. Everyone will love this cd.
This is fantastic music by such a talented singer songwriter. I would highly recommend it! I use it often in my yoga classes.
Not much more to say about this CD and her songs love them all.  Great list of songs on this CD.
I did not give it 5 star rating because there were no lyrics written for the amazing album.  I recommended it to all who have loved and lost!  Adele is so wonderful!.
It's exactly what I wanted and expected from Adele.  Wonderful.  It has all my favorites of hers to sing along in the car with!
have enjoyed this cd. Liked that I could download the mp3 right away but why would the mp3 and cd together be cheaper then the mp3 or cd by themselves?
If you're looking for a record that'll make you wanna trash your beloved's belongings and have make-up sex amid the ruins 21's your jam.
Great DVD. Luv the two different renditions of certain tunes.  A great voice and great lyrics.  Sing alone in the car!
"Hadn't listened to Adele before this album came out - heard of her but just hadn't heard anything but the hit off the first album - ""Chasing Pavements"".  She has a wonderful voice - mature way beyond her years - and while I love the whole album her version of Lovesong is quite the most beautiful version I have ever heard. If I was drinking her she would be a superb aged cognac!  Delicious."
A very talented singer and composer.  Would really love to see how she evolved in the next 10 years and I hope I am still listening to her sound.
I love Adele and this CD is just wonderful.  Her voice is beautiful and she can really sing a song.
This album is wonderful spend many days with it on repeat. Just keeps me going! With this I can do anything!!
This CD is ok. I only knew a couple of the songs that I liked.  The songs seem to all sound the same.
This has to be my favorite album of 2011 (so far). To me her sound is very retro which makes it that much more appealing.  Certainly cannot wait for more.
What a voice. Man. She is so powerful and I love her words. I listen to this dvd all the time and would love to go to England and see her perform. What a voice and personality.
This was my first purchase of Adele but it won't be my last. What an amazing voice she has. I am now a fan for life; keep them coming Adele!
This album is one of the best albums I've purchased and now have in my collection.  Every song by Adele is wonderful.  Whenever I'm in my car I play this album over and over again and never get tired hearing her voice and her lyrics.  It's a must have for everyone!!
This cd has several great songs! It took me a little time to get used to it because it is different from her first cd but it is worth purchasing.
I actually bought this for her #1 hit and so far I think that is the best one on the CD.  It's all good listening tho.
Doesn't get much better than this. Great clarity and I just wanted one of Adele's CDs. I picked this one with great results. Amazon did a great job packaging delivering safely and fast.
Good to listen to but the songs are very similar and need to have more variety in both the music and the words.
Nothing to tell you here except I bought this after everyone else and It didn't disappoint -  It is a great album
The first two selections are fun and suited to Adele's unique voice.  I also enjoy her voice counter-posed against smooth piano. Good solid CD!
I had never heard of Adele never seen her nor pretended to care about the Grammy/BBC accolades (which I have long since abandoned). So a friend gives me a copy. To this listener albums are a by-product of over-produced drivel waste of my time;  I'll take a good song over sex any day. Adele's 21 has some good songs. In a word refreshing.Favorite to filler~Fantastic: Someone like youGoods: Rolling in the Deep-Don't you Remember- Lovesong- Set Fire to the Rain- One and OnlyOn the verge: -Turning Tables- Rumour has it(not unlistenable background) Filler: - I'll be waiting- Take it All- He Won't Go (easily the worst song on the record)So... give Adele a chance her voice is at once impressive and frail; human which I like.
Just love 21 she is awesome fabulous voice!  This is my first Adele CD and I plan to listen and purchase more of her music.
One of the best cd's ever!  Every song is a good one.  What a talent Adele is.  I recommend this CD -- highly!!
OK.  Odds are you are reading these reviews after already listening to this album and thinking you may just be crazy being totally taken in by this almost devilishly beautiful and perfect album.  No I and all the others are here to tell you that you are not crazy.  This album is more than mind and soul blowing.  The construction is so simple yet everything perfectly in its place.  But the form is just a vehicle for the essence which is conveyed so well it is hard to imagine a better album.  There are no weak spots here whatsoever.  It makes me sad in a way because this quality of music is so rare.  It is hard to think of anything comparable.
I cannot say much about this album.  It is one of the best albums ever recorded.  Kind of leaves me breathless and always in a more relaxed mood.  I love it.
Adele Adele man she sound's good she has it all soul rock pop etc. Buy this CD and you will see what I'm talking about.
This is one of the strongest album that I have heard in many years. Every song in the album is exceptionally good and every song has the real possibility of being a #1 pop hit if not just in the top 10. The whole album is well worth the money you spent purchasing it.
Great cd. I really like her music. I don't purchase very many cd but this one is great worth the money
Love this CD love all Adele's work.  Looking forward to her next release.  Would give this as a gift to anyone.
"""Rolling in the Deep"" brought me to the album but I'm captivated by ""Someone Like You""! This album seriously out-shines 19 and absolutely cannot wait to hear what she has in store for her next album!!"
She is absolutley true to the hype about her voice. I love listening to this CD. Adele tells her love story through her voice.
"I frequently am brought to tears. It is a terrible habit of mine. But in this case those tears are so deserved. 21 by Adele is a wonderful mapping of the process one goes through in the course of a breakup particularly a brutal one and Adele seemed to experience in the last few years. What's incredible is that she can write and represent the mutual experience of so many individuals no matter the age no matter the gender no matter the turmoil. A specific favorite of mine is most definitely the bridge ""One and Only"" on the surface a declaration of love but take a closer look and you realize its in many ways a hopeful plea for a reunion. It is as if she is trying to say ""I'm here in front of you get a clue"" but in a far more eloquent and romantic way. And who hasn't felt like that at some point who hasn't wanted to say exactly that? And let's not forget another gorgeous song that is ""Set Fire to the Rain."" Without fail it demonstrates another facet of a relationship's demise: the fury the loud and screaming heartache all piercing through the unbelievable force of Adele's chorus. No matter which stage one finds his/herself - the honeymoon period the lulls the beginning of the end the aftermath - there is something in this record for everyone."
Excellent choice and mix of Adele's songs.  Most were of excellent taste giving insight to the artist's range of moods and thoughts.
best cd is amazing! Adele has a glorious voice. every song is great. they remake of the cure love song is phenomenal! love it!
She has a classic voice. Totally enjoyable can be played frequently without getting tired of it. It's a good purchase.
I had only heard a few songs of Adele's on the radio but went ahead and purchased the album hoping I would like it all.  I play this over and over inside the car and when I remember to bring it in the house it goes on over and over there  too.  Great album! I love her style.
I hope that she finds happiness. I have had my share of disappointment and heartbreak but I never blame anyone. She has a great voice though.
I love me some Adele.  Her whole CD I love it.  I like all of her songs on this CD and now I want to buy her past CD as well.
It's Adele....enough said about this extraordinary artist.  All of her first hits are included and some new ones too!  Great album.
I love this CD and would highly recommend it. If you like any of Adele's songs you will love this cd.  Great seller also arrived quickly would do business again.
You cannot help but love Adele.  There was a lot of brew-ha-ha when she first came out about her size.  Know what?  Doesn't matter.  This woman sings with her soul and she has the passion in her voice to back it up.  They say that it &#34;ain't over until the fat lady sings&#34;.  Thank God that's not true.....(and who gives a sh*t anyway unless you are ....never mind....it will get censored)I look forward to listening to her voice for years to come.  This is a great CD with lots of great songs (albeit mostly heartbreak songs so if you're going through that as I recently did it might be tough to listen to as they are from the heart).Buy this CD.  You will not be disappointed and will find yourself singing along after awhile.
Awesome voice...very infectious...a total enjoyable listening experience. Heard of her on a T.V. show...heard her perform and had to have her latest album! Am enjoying her in the car on my computer and at home! Best buy ever!
I liked 'Rolling In The Deep' alot but i didn't think that was my kind of music until i listened to ths album from start to finish. Wow. Its so good. It is so beautiful. Turns out this is my kind of music! I think almost everyone will AT LEAST like this album no matter what kind of music you like. Give it a try just buy it! :)
Adele is a great singer with some really good songs. However the songs are a bit repetitive between each other often giving me the feeling that it is a continuation of a previous song. Not necessarily a bad thing.
Just lovely; I think there is only 1 song I'm not crazy about.  I would have to say it is the perfect mood music!
I haven't heard of Adele before this album. I listened to one of her songs from this album on NPR and decided to buy the album after sampling all the songs here on Amazon. Boy was I blown away. What a great voice she has got. Beautiful Peaceful Soulful. Ineffable. This is the first album in years that I listened to without skipping a single song. That says something.I sincerely hope she doesn't go the Lady GaGa route and waste her talent. We need singers like Adele.If you are like me who likes good lyrics and a soulful music buy this album. You won't regret.PS: Listen to this album form start to finish without interruption. That's when you feel it and the feeling stays with you for hours after that.
The songs appeared enjoyable but after some time the voice pattern seems repeatable. We listened to to CD for the first few days and got bored. Some variation in the voice would be very useful and exciting.
"Let me start by saying I'm a 42 y.o female.  While at my office about 3 weeks ago a song came on the radio that stopped me in my tracks. I got out of my chair went to check the radio station and immediately did an internet search to find out what this heavenly voice was.  It was Adele singing ""Rolling in the Deep"".  That night I went home and ordered this cd.I have to say that for such a young woman she absolutely moves me. She wrote every song on this record at the age of 21 and that by itself is quite impressive.  And her voice - all I can say is WOW.  I particulary enjoy ""Set Fire to the Rain"" and ""He Won't Go"".  By the time you get to the end of the CD and listen to ""Someone like You"" you'd better be prepared with a box of tissue.  Check YouTube for her live performance of the song at the Brit Awards and don't say I didn't warn you.Needless to say after listening to this record several times my hubby and I are instant fans.  Some artists of today have to dress up in crazy costumes & makeup and pop out of an egg to be relevant & attract attention.  Thank God Adele is the real thing just pure and natural talent.  I'm so happy I discovered her."
I liked this even better an &#34;19&#34;.  I will definitely purchase more CD by her in the future for my listening pleasure.  Some songs definitely bring back wonderful and sometimes painful memories.
Great classic timeless songs.  I'll be listening to this cd for years to come.  I have to give it up to the British songstresses (Amy Winehouse Adele Corinne Bailey Rae) they've really been holding it down!!  Adele's voice is such an incredible instrument and she knows how to play it to the fullest.  She produces each note to pitch perfection.  Bravo.  Her songwriting is top notch too and the arrangements are catchy.  She must have gone through quite an ordeal in her relationship to produce these songs.  Much like how Corinne Bailey Rae's death informed her CD The Sea (another brilliant collection of songs by a British songstress) IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT GO AND GET IT NOW.  You must have gone thru some pain and come out better on the other end to be able to tell these stories this poetry to music.  My 6 year old son sings along to Rolling in the Deep and Rumor Has It - actually asks me to play them - and he normally only will listen to Eminem Soljah Boy Bob Marley and The Black Keys.  So that tells you something right there!!!
Who doesn't like Adele in my age bracket. She is so soulful yet hip. This is a great cd for her fans.
I love all the songs and play it continuously.  I usually download songs to my ipod but decided I needed a CD for the house or car.  So glad I did -  This lady can sing!!
It was my first purchase of a CD by Adele.  She is terrific powerful and she sings like she really means it.  It is beautiful.
As most of the world does I love this CD.  The product was received in a timely manner and was in great shape.  I have received CDs that have cracked or chipped cases.  This was in perfect shape upon arrival.  The CD itself is a hit after a hit!  I would recommend!!
Decades from now.Im rarely impressed with anybody these days. New music is usually garbage. Most of it. But Adele is honestly one of the Queens and every single song on this album is amazing. ALL of them. No fillers. No crap. Just 11 fantastic trax that hit your emotions for real. If you cant relate or feel any of this- your simply not human. At least not to me. I hope to see my old age just to see this one held as a standard. I certainly hope it becomes a standard. She is beyond amazing. Shes beyond words. And this is coming from a woman who (myself) who has collected and heard just about everything. Love this chick so much. Classic sounds. Feelings deeper than most can feel.  BUY IT.
cd arrived in brand new packaging as promised which is a great deal because it was such a low price. And the cd is amazing!! Definatley buy it if your not sure. No complaints.
This CD was no less than amazing.  Adele is one of the best new artists in the market.  Usually there are several songs in a CD that are basically &#34;fillers&#34; but every single one was fabulous!  Highly recommend this CD.
This CD is amazing. I love Adele. Her music is so amazingly good. You should totally get this CD:)The shipping was fast.
"Definite favs after a few playbacks but excellent f/u to freshman effort that exceeded most people's ""best"" efforts. Probably won't get a lot of radio play; but then radio is half dead anyway. Doing mucho hits online already.  Nice mix of styles & co-writers and left me hoping for more. I also got an incredible price by buying pre-release on Amazon !!!"
"""21"" by Adele is very heartfelt and original.  I was convinced to check out the cd when I saw my husband viewing the online video of one of the military females doing an excellent cover of ""Rolling in the Deep"".  I also enjoy this cd because Adele put so much of her heart and her feelings about her former love into many of her songs.  My favorite musical gem in ""21"" is Adele's cover of ""Lovesong"". ""Lovesong"" is a great song about loving someone through many years regardless of what happens in life.  ""21"" by Adele is best to get  for anyone that enjoys pop songs about the dramatic side of love."
A copy is in my car on my computer...so I'm listening and enjoying '21' by Adele almost everyday! I'm so very glad to have purchased it...now will buy more of her work1
This is a wonderful CD. Love the sound use it in the car and in my phone recommend this CD and singer. I can't imagine that you have not heard her sound  it would make a great gift for any age.
I bought this CD as a gift for my mom who had just recently undergone a surgery and was having to spend large amounts of time sitting or laying in one place and when you're stuck like that some new music is the best thing in the world. I (and she) couldn't be happier with the quality of this album.From start to finish the young British songstress pumps out nothing but timeless pieces focusing on emotion and human interaction 2 things that never change. I imagine this being the sort of album I'll be able to play for kids or grand-kids in 20 or 30 years and still get an excellent response.Honestly if you're even reading this review then this album is for you.
Adele's '21' was simply amazing. It's one of those rare albums that you don't have to skip any songs. Anyone thinking about purchasing it should stop right now and DO IT.
Went looking for my Adele CD and it had mysteriously &#34;disappeared&#34; (perhaps into my partner's CD player in his car) so bought a second copy to play around the house. Love love love Adele! What a talented and soulful young woman she is.
What a great vocalist and songwriter this woman is. Every single song is killer soul-ripping gut-grabbing. Rolling in the deep is the outstanding track here but so is the last song someone like you. This album was inspired by Adele's break up with an ex. Boy poet's shure need the pain.
Great cd. This young lady has a incredible voice and a very good writing ability. She will be around for a long time.
I am obsessed with this CD! Adele has a beautiful voice! And this CD is perfect from start to end!!
I love The music and vocals. First time I remember hearing this was on the movie &#34;I am Number Four&#34; the song was &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34;. I purchased &#34;Adele 21&#34; and love the album.
Adele is one of the few singers that is blessed with a true instrument which is her voice. The emotions that she conveys with her expression and phrasing is outstanding.  She sings with emotion and passion which is not present with many vocalists today. There is no set form or pattern to her music and it isn't manufactured to fit a certain style or predefined group. In other words it isn't canned and this CD is refreshing. Adele and the musicians on this CD play real music.Adele appeals to every age. She sings with true emotion that listening really listening gets to your soul. If you are a person who enjoys music and gifted vocalists this CD is for you. A true soul singer she is really is!
Let's be honest the hit tracks from this album are undeniable. I love all of Adele's work thus far and her sophomore album is overall worthy of its particular accolades. To be honest I'm not sure the album as a whole feels quite as fresh as Adele 19 yet I enjoyed all of the B sides in addition to the hits. Some of the B sides have grown on me more with multiple listens too. There's just something - it might be the production - that makes 19 feel more fresh to me overall. Both 19 and 21 however are simply must listens.I purchased the vinyl which I love having. But do be warned the mp3 download code which is supposedly included does not work. I don't understand what's going on that this is the case but you're better off knowing it ahead of time. I'm still glad I got the vinyl even though I had to turn around and buy the mp3 so I could listen in the car. But its a nice solid vinyl not one of those cheap flimsy just for sentiment's sake releases and it's got that satisfyingly warm sounds that keeps vinyl lovers devoted.
As the artist I am impressed with Adele's voice she has that gravely rasp that resembles what Janis Joplin sounded like and to a lesser degree somewhat similar to Bonnie Raitt.I'd bet that if she went on with her career even just as a blues vocalist & nothing more she'd always be on top.As for the cd itself I am really disappointed except for the quieter tunes all of them appear to be *brickwalled*.I went to the effort of uploading them to wav and ran them all thru my editor to look at the wav forms and nearly ALL of them have been *pumped* to a ridiculous amount of gain needing so much compression to be obviously introduced to prevent clipping. Why would any engineer do this?
"I started listening to her a couple of years back before anyone had really heard about her just like the guy from ""Secondhand Serenade""!!  I guess I know good stuff when I hear it!!PEOPLE! Go out and buy these CD's or download them.  I strongly recommend it."
The only thing I listen to in the car.  Best CD i have bought in a long tme & my first Adele CD worth it.
This CD has all of Adele's best and greatest songs.  It came in new condition at a great price!  I listen to it all the time!
Have heard so much of Adele on the radio that in the end had to buy one of her CDs and 21 did not dissappoint.  Makes for a great listen and is great to do the housework too played nice and loud.
This is worth all the hype and more. Every single song is a hit and her unique voice make it spectacular. So don't hesitate to purchase it.
this is good but her musci is a bit of a downer she is always crying about a love gone bad
I love this album.  Adele has an awesome voice and writes wonderful songs.  I can't stop humming them all day long.
My husband was very happy to receive this item in his Xmas stocking - he loves Adele and her music.
She has a wonderful voice and has a story to tell.  Several of her songs are on my IPod for my workout.
"There's not much I can say about Adele's ""21"" that hasn't already been said.  It is full of great music and refreshing intelligent lyrics.  In fact for the first time in a long time the lyrics are what make this album of songs great. You won't find any mind numbing senseless lyrics such as ""my humps"" but soulful reflective anecdotal  words straight from the heart of the writer Adele.  Her songs have a broad reach. Both teenagers and more mature folk will find something to relate to on this album.  Some of the songs fit into the entertainment category but even those songs have thought provoking lyrics.  It makes me sad to read reviews and blogs where people are criticizing and even making fun of Adele's weight.  If she were a svelte perfectly beautiful young woman with a shallow well of emotion and few painful experiences to draw upon I doubt this album would have ever been made.  Sadly as it is Adele's pain is our gain.  After more than a decade of obtuse intelligence-insulting blather from unintelligent scam ""artists"" it is almost miraculous that Adele has become the success that she has. I am grateful to her for producing great music with equally great lyrics.  ""21"" is an incredible work of art.  I highly recommend this album of songs."
I loved Adele's first album her voice is so haunting and it does sound like she's a woman twice her age sitting at the edge of a bar her bourbon-soaked voice catching your ear at once and then cutting through you as she loses all restraint and hits those high notes with effortless resonance and clarity.This album on first listen grabs you and yoiu're left almost shaken by the honesty and beauty of her lyrics and melodies. I first heard the single and then Set Fire to the Rain and within minutes I knew I would have to own this album. If you've ever been wronged if you've ever been used or taken advantage of - Adele sings for you her soulful voice righting all those moments you were left speechless with hurt. This is an album that becomes an immediate entry for album of the year and will likely prove to be a classic in the years to come. Greatness cannot be explained it's an odd mixture of authenticity and melodies hitting the listener's ears at a precise moment so that you feel the music is bigger than you and comes from something greater than even the singer. This meets all those standards.If you're skeptical at all just give the songs a listen they'll make the decision for you.
wow.  new talent in a world of fake plastic bubble gum garbage.  ADELE is REAL MUSIC REAL TALENT! If you've ever lived hurt or lost love this CD will reach your heart.
Awesome singer and the album has all her greatest hits.  Highly recommended!!!!  I listen to the cd everyday.  Her voice is out of this world.
Simply amazing record. Extremely well produced and the sound is exceptional. Not all vinyl sounds impressive this one however does.
"A friend told me there wasn't a song on this CD she didn't like and she was right. An absolute ""must purchase""!!"
"I suppose that in this day and age of women that can't get record deals without exploiting their physical appearance I should be glad that Adele is the first artist in a long time to sell millions of CDs without resorting to a cheap and tawdry image.  But that's where the accolades end for me.  Thanks to the advent of audio recording and mass produced sound media the world has been blessed with the chance to hear some of the greatest voices the world has ever known.  And you may not like their songs or their style of music but it is difficult to deny the sheer quality of their performances whether thinking of Martina McBride Celine Dion Jodi Benson Mariah Carey Vanessa Williams Beyonce Jennifer Hudson and in her prime--may she rest--the late great Whitney Houston.  The power clarity range and dynamism have set an absolutely stratospheric standard for ""the best in singing voices.""If oh I don't know Janice Joplin is the best we could do and then along comes Adele I could imagine people practically wetting themselves over this girl's voice.  But the fact of the matter is it is probably more soothing to the ears to hear a person being killed boiled alive in Acid than to tolerate Adele's voice.  I can't care about the lyrics and even the underlying music (I could barely notice it was there) because all there was was that voice.  I shall never forget the first time I heard this woman's voice.  A colleague of mine was playing her music on his iPod and told me who it was and I could not believe that this person had actually gotten a record deal sounding the way that she does.  The broken crackling sound of a teenage boy trying to grow an Adam's Apple is what I thought I was hearing until someone told me this record actually won a Grammy.  I could not believe it!However it was just one track so I had to hear the whole album for myself picking it up--thankfully for just two dollars at a local second hand CD shop in Sherman Oaks.  And Oh My God.  AOL discs that used to come in the mail were good enough to be coasters but I wouldn't even use this disc for that purpose.  I honestly cannot more strongly express my absolutely disdain for this recording and in particular Adele's voice.  I sometimes hear her obnoxious songs on the radio and immediately push the off button.  It seriously turns my stomach to hear her do what she calls sing.  The fact that So many seem to think that this is the best we can do might explain why CD sales are in such a free fall in the United States.  God help us if more try to sound like this woman.  The fact that she is so young and yet sounds like this breaks my heart even further."
I only like one of her songs.  But I don't get it why USA is giving so much attention when we have as good if not better talent of out own.
This album is amazing even better than her first powerful and moving.  Her voice and music is clear and original...Love it!
So wonderful to listen to a true vocal talent... Love her voice & style of music.  Looking forward to more great music from her in the future.  Great CD
This is a great album! ADELE is one of my favorite artists and her album 21 showcases her voice. Definately a great buy!
What an amazingly gifted artist. After listening to all the songs I went out to find the lyrics as well. Easy purchasing through Amazon they definitely have it figured out.
Never get tired of listening to this CD.  I cannot wait for Adele to cut another CD.  Definitely a classic!
There was no CD. There was shrink wrap packaging on the container. With all of the other packages I received there was a receipt with instructions inside on how to return it. There were none on this one.I do want the CD. Please tell me what I have to do. The only good thing was that this was for me. I have NEVER had any trouble before with Amazon.
Love Adele's voice enjoy most of her songs.  It seems she likes one style more than others.  I wish she had more in the style of skyfall and wish that song were on a cd.  Recommend to anyone who loves a good voice.
Everyone loves ADELE so I purchased this for someone I don't know well or hardly at all. I knew he would be at our Christmas party and didnt want for him to not get a gift. I did inquire and found that he loves music so I chose Adele.
This is an awsome  disc.  Adele has a beautiful strong voice.  I would recommend this disc to everyone.  She is very soulful.
Received in a couple of days.  Great customer service.  Great CD. Today's sounds but something for everyone.  You won't be disappointed....loving it!
21 by Adele is a direct connection with all the emotions in a relationship from anger to revenge from love to hate from desperation to exhilaration.. but above all.... her voice is like sharp honey it cuts you deeply but feels so good as she pours over you. This girls voice will get to you.
She's fairly fabulous;  may get more of her - she's  addicting.  But her speaking voice needs work.  She has more range than Annie Lenox.
Love love love Adele--all of her songs are fabulous.  Very deep and impressive in their simplicity but so strong.  Problem is I bawl like a broken-hearted baby every time I listen to her.
"Wow Adele has an amazing rich soulful bluesy voice.I get lost listening her beautiful voice.  I think her song lyrics are a little ""meh"" and abstract not like Amy Winehouse or Duffy.  The latter two are much more descriptive and you hear a musical story but with Adele you really have to set your imagination loose when you're listening to her lyrics.This album is full of songs about lost loves what could have been and all the sadness of moving on (or the inability of moving on).The good:- AMAZING voice....- ""Set Fire to the Rain"" - WOW..!!- ""Rumour has it"" - I love this song.  Here's an example of where the vagueness of the songwriting actually works because even when the song finishes you're wondering what the rumor really is but because the lyrics are vague you're never certain just like a rumor....  (TA-DA - brilliant)- ""Rolling in the Deep"" - The vocals are amazing in this song.- ""Someone like You"" - OMG I can almost hear her heart breaking in this.  Her voice truly bears the weightiness of emotions in this song of love lost and seeing that love move on when you haven't.  Oh!!The bad:- Vague half-hearted lyrics."
After hearing the song &#34;Chasing Pavements&#34; I just knew I had to get this CD. Beautiful voice. She just has to stand there and deliver and she does.
I know I'm late to the party but damn I'm glad I'm here. Adele's voice shines on this album; the song writing is solid; and the throw back sound is executed so well it sounds as modern as anything else out there. A truly timeless album. There were some tracks (&#34;Turn The Tables&#34; &#34;Don't You Remember&#34; and &#34;Take It All&#34;) that just aren't for me but even those are very well made. I love how the album changes style throughout but I can't help but feel it's not complete. It may just be the songs I don't like breaking the intended rhythm for me but I can't help but feel something is missing on this album.All and all though 4 stars captures my opinion of this album. I'm very happy with it the ballads blew me away but there's something missing for me so I can't appreciate it as much as other s have.
Adele is very talented her voice brings a new level of perfection. I truly hope that she soon  cuts another album
I am a reluctant Adele fan because she is so huge. Artists that become very popular are not always worthy in my humble opinion. Adele is exceptional. She has a strong voice and is a great songwriter. Her songs are sad and about love but she speaks from a place of truth. I don't think they are pity songs. I think it's just self expression. I don't think she feels sorry for herself. The songs made me pay attention and her voice is just so powerful. She's inspirational. It's ok to indulge in feelings. It makes us alive and human. She makes it look easy when I know a lot of work goes into it. She's a true professional. I can't wait to see where else she will take us. I hope this is just the beginning.
Soooo good it gives me goosebumps! Seldom does a CD hit me so hard on the first listen this one I knew after one listen that its going to be played over and over for quite some time in my car home and ipod!!! Love it!
"Great AlbumIf you like a different type of music that is not ""Commercialized"" then this album is for you.Great song writing and Adele has a unique voice."
FANTASTIC CD!  GET IT FOR YOUR PERSONAL COLLECTION.  You won't tire of listening to it over and over again.  She is such a masterful songstress and an exquisite lady for sure!
I've been waiting on purchasing the CD. I'm sorry I waited so long but it is well worth it.  The delivery arrived as expected and all is good with this purchase.
this is the first cd i have bought in many years i only knew two songs when i got it and now i do not even listen to them really now every song on the cd is better than the next. her version of lovesong... fantastic; she never ceases to amaze me. love this cd!! a must buy =) xoxo
I was very excited to hear about Adele 21 when it was launching.  It is very soulful and has been well worth the wait.  From the first tracking Rolling in the Deep to shaking your hips with Rumor Has It and then covering the Cure's Love Song there's not a bad track on the entire cd. She's rekindling that soulful and sassy spark that woman were singing with in the 60's  I love it. Well worth owning.
Adele has a wonderful voice that has quite the range.  Bluesy jazzy soulful and anthemic.  She can hold her own.
"Maybe I'm missing something judging by all the great reviews but I was disappointed. I loved 19 (I could listen the whole way through and not skip a song)and have seen Adele live and therefore pre-ordered 21 however the albums are simply not of the same quality.  You would think she had aged 20 years rather than 2 based on the boring music and/or depressing mediocre ballads and lack of what I can only call ""singability.""  While 19 had a lot of themes of unreturned love it still managed to be fun to listen to and hopeful or at least insightful.  There are a couple of good songs like ""He Won't Go"" and ""Rolling in the Deep""  but they are just not as good as ""Chasing Pavements"" or frankly ANY of 19's tracks. I just feel like I've heard it before."
Adele's current hit song is on this album.  I love the song although I am getting tired of it being played over and over and over again on all the radio stations.  They should be playing all of her songs as they are all very good.  There isn't a song I don't like on this album or on her album titled 19
This has become by far not only one of my favorite cd's but also one of my favorite artist. Her music and her vocals make her a unique and soulful artist. This cd does not dissapoint.
This is my first Adele CD and I will be adding other's to my collection. Her voice is a rare one and lovely to listen to.
Adele is on eof a kind I have not heard anything compareable sience Stivie Nicks. Its an amazing CD. I would recommend it to EVERYONE......................
This is one of the best CDs I have heard in a long time.Cudoos Adele! Can't wait for the next one.
I got this because I liked the radio songs.  After getting it I find that I enjoyed the other songs even more.  &#34;One and Only&#34; is really good.  Adele should do a classics album like all the ones Rod Stewart has been doing.  I would love to hear more classics like &#34;I will always love you&#34;.
excellant CD love all the songs on this CD.came pretty fast.any Adel fan would like it. happy with my purchase
Sets one up for the live concert at the Royal Albert Hall.  Adele takes us all to places we've had to go to be able to know what love is and how to appreciate it even when it doesn't work out.
If your a true fan you wont be disappointed and if you havn't heard real music in while you will be very  satisfied.
Although most of her songs have been on the radio already I still like to listen to Adele. She has an amazing voice and I love the way she seems to transmit her emotions into each and every song. I cannot wait for her new material!
"Love this music. With all the hip-shaking half-nakedness and Auto-tunes it's hard to know what to put down your hard earned money on.  I haven't bought an actual CD in years nothing has been worth it.  But I heard ""Rolling Deep"" and saw the video and said that's what I'm going to buy.  I've been listening to it non-stop.  Thank you Adele for knowing what real music is."
"This is one of the best CD's I've heard in a long time. You can practically play it from beginning to end. I couldn't get ""Rolling in the Deep"" out of my heard so I purchased the CD and was pleasantly surprised. Adele has a unique sound which is what's missing from the scene of cookie-cutter artists."
Great Music...Another 5 stars for Adele she has a wonderful sound and her music touches your heart. You won't regret getting this product.
I am very unhappy about the item I have received. I just barely checked the mail and when I opened the very thin package I saw immediately that there were two chunks out of the disk case and had a HUGE Crack all throughout the case I checked the disk and it also had scratches. There was a very thin sheet of bubble wrap but nothing to secure the package in the correct way like many other vendors have done for me in the past. And not just me but all their customers. Make sure the quality is as you paid for. This was a first for me to receive a damaged item.
"La'Tasha BryanEnglish 201Professor ChessmanWeb ReviewMusic is a type of therapy for people in society. Music speaks the words that people are afraid to tell their soul mate. It can also lift up your spirit. When you're feeling down you always want to hear songs that can relate to and bring smiles even tears of joy to your face. Adele's CD 21 is one of the best-selling CD in the world today. Her album speaks about her fortunate break up with her ex and how she moves on. Throughout Adele's CD one can get through many things and feel relief.One of Adele's most famous songs on her album 21 is Rolling in the Deep. The song Rolling in the Deep speaks about how her old soul mate broke up with her and the rage she feels towards him and the break up. Adele states ""We could have had it all rolling in the deep you had my heart and soul but you played it with a beating"". However even though her ex treated her wrong she remembers that they could have had the best relationship in the world. Most females feel that their relationships are going to last forever or at least they hope it will. Even when a male treats them wrong they still have hope in the relationship lasting forever. What is so special about the album is Adele makes you feel so connected to her.Each song in her album talks about her own personal life and what women and males go through in their relationships from beginning to end. The last song on her album is the perfect song to end it Someone like you. Someone like you is an extremely special song since this song talks about the breaking up and moving on. Adele repeats numerous times in her song "" Never mind I'll find someone like you"".  Every girl wants that GIRL POWER songs that will get her right back on her feet and take away her tears. Adele's songs do exactly that.Adele's album 21 is a powerful album. Her cd isn't enough just to download it on I tunes you have to buy the CD itself. It is rare that you find an album that you can play the whole cd through and jam with your girls to. However Adele's album does just that it brings your sprit up. Everyone should go out and buy Adele's cd because it is just that great."
I was hesitant to buy this cd but this was the best purchase ever. Adele has the most beautiful voice and I love the words to the songs. I got the CD on Friday and haven't stopped playing it yet. You will not regret this purchase.
otherwise my kids like something (annoying like Psy's Gangnam Style); or my wife enjoys new Kpop (i like mid to late 90s stuff); or i like miles davis or other classic jazz.this album by Adele is a modern masterpiece that we can all enjoy.
I Have not bought a cd in many yearsperhaps over 15 years.But after hearing this woman sing I had to own it!
After falling in love with Chasing Pavements I thought that I liked Adele then Rolling in the Deep came out. If it's not your new favorite song it's got to be in at least your top five. Unbelievable vocals with a driving beat that will move you.
"I was a fan of Adele once I heard ""Chasing Pavements"" but after watching a special on creating the album ""21"" and hearing a clip of ""Rolling in the Deep"" I had a new appreciation for Adele and her music. She has a soulful voice and her lyrics are honest and can relate to so many people at once."
I am an eclectic  audiophile and purchased this album about a year ago and have listened to its entirety over and over to the point of boredom. I had filed her away but recently burned a copy for my fiance' who instantly fell in love with Adele...and now I have fallen in love with her all over again. So I pulled out her album again and am on the second wind of playing her over and over again.  I felt motivated to write a review by some negative reviews.I heartily disagree with some viewers' comments that every song on this album is whiny.Quite the contrary this album runs the gamut of emotions much like the life-cycle of a relationship: ecstasy torment anger resolve and acceptance.  This album will be timeless and one of those albums that I would want to have with me if I happen to be stranded on an island. Pure artistry and raw talent. no gimmicks of vocal synthesization via computers- which is refreshing in an age of lip synch and computerized music.
Adele 21.......joyful masterful simply the best CD I have bought in years.  With all the overly computerized vocals going on (GaGa Katy Ke$ha Britney)  Adele gives you her real honest and soulful voice.  Every song is perfectly written and even though I have no musical production experience it is obvious to me that Adele and her team produced this entire CD to the highest degree possible.  There is nothing sloppy or rushed about any of the songs.  When I buy a CD I spend my hard earned money to hear the vocals (which are pure) and the music (which is flawless).  Adele is the real deal.  This CD is better than 19 not because 19 was a bad compilation of music but because she has grown and matured like anyone who works hard to perfect their craft would.  I wish I could give it 10 stars!
This album is outstanding. Adele's music and singing talent will stand the test of time for many many years to come. I don't know why I took so long to get this album.
Enjoyed many of her songs on the radio. So I decided to download it for my own use. I listen to it often.
Yes I am also sick of the inundation of Adele songs on the radio.  But you cannot discount that Adele's style is refreshingly new (now often copied) her beat unique her songs memorable.  Simply briliiant.
With the death of Whitney Houston Adele is now unchallenged as the greatest living female singer.  This album is a triumph and is great music for the car or the gym.
"Ever since I heard ""Chasing Pavements"" a few years ago I have really loved Adele. I was really excited to get this new album but I have to admit that I didn't like it at first. All the songs sounded the same and there were too many ballads. I guess I wanted a dozen copies of ""Rolling in the Deep."" But after listening to the album several times listening to the lyrics and really letting the songs seep into me I love it. She shows such a maturity with these songs; it's hard to believe she's only 21. Has she really experienced the heartache that she sings about? Other than ""Rolling in the Deep"" my favorite songs are ""Set Fire to the Rain"" and ""Someone Like You."" She sings with such power and the lyrics are really heartbreaking. Other standouts are Don't You Remember I'll Be Waiting and One and Only. Although I love the album I still wish there were more songs with the tough dirty sassy sound of Rolling in the Deep and Rumour Has It. Most of the songs show her as a really vulnerable abandoned lover who's been done wrong. But she sings this kind of song so well it's hard to fault her too much.I also want to say that people pidgeon hole Adele by saying she's just another blue-eyed soul diva singing 60s style songs. This is true to an extent especially on ""I'll Be Waiting"" (which reminds me a little of Aretha Franklin. This and Rolling in the Deep are the only 2 tracks that sound ""60s"" to me). But really Adele is so much more than this. Let's not pin her down so rigidly."
This album is simply amazing!  To me these songs express healing from relationships loving yourself not settling welcoming new loves or fresh starts and sooooo much more!  She hit the jack pot with this cd--so many people can identify with the words of these songs.  Adele is an exceptional artist!
her best record and you will listen to it over and over  again. Purchase many and give as gifts. to all your friends
I didnt realize alot of the songs that I like were Adele.  Now I know and I am so glad that I purchased this CD (Download).
I love this CD.  Unfortunately the radio has overplayed some of the tunes.  Overall it is a great piece of work and nice to listen to as a whole.
I love every song on this CD.  Growing up I loved Carol King now I love Adele.  The music speaks to my soul.  I love it very happy with it.
What can I say...this album is fantastic. If you love Adele you will like this CD. I get tired of it then drag it out in a couple months and enjoy it all over again.
i have been waiting for this album forever...i didnt know it though till i heard it..WONDERFUL!!!! this album and this lady are the best!!!
Love Adele ....what is not to love.  Her voice her songs I keep her CD in my car and play almost every time I get in my car.  I would highly recommend it.
Excellent CD.  Love it when a talented musician not only can sing but is a talented pianist.  Adele is not only a songwriter she is a poet!  Her songs of pain and heartache are poetry put to music!
I love her music. I don't know how to critique an album. Music is such a personal choice. The recording is good and it sounds incredible playing from my phone to my headphones. I haven't figured out how to see the booklet but I haven't tried yet. I'm enjoying my new album and aren't too worried about it...
Even though this CD break my heart I still love that I bought it. I got a good deal the product was good and shipping was fast.
Her music is so relaxing to listen to. My daughter asked for it for a gift and I listened to it with her and liked it to.
It has been a long time since I have heard an album this good.  I am a newcomer to Adele and so far I am amazed how good she is.  After my  first run through on the album I was reminded of Janis Ian quality of music and sound (now you know how old I am).  Believe me you will not go wrong with buying this fantastic album.
Adele is a singer who can just sing anything. I thought her last cd was good boy this one is outstanding.  Great cd and great vocals.
I had been waiting for this album and it has certainly has been worth the wait! Adele is back with some of the most beautiful melodies intriguing and soul stirring lyrics and an absolutely STELLAR voice! Track after track the music on 21 pulls you in paints a picture and takes control your heart and ears as the music engulfs you. This album is a brilliant tribute to the influences of Blues Country Rock and Soul! I am eagerly anticipating being there at her live performance when her tour hits the Metro NY area this coming summer. Bravo Adele! BRAVO!
"I bought Adele's 21 CD after hearing ""someone like you"" on the radio about 10 times a day. The CD is unbelievable. From the first to the last song every lyrics and tune is just so powerful. A great gift for any lady or even man."
oh what a good album!!!! she makes u want to scream!it arrived fine and no problemsi love her stuff
I am just in awe of Adele's CD. I love every song; the arrangements are amazing. I love her voice-it is so pure and raw all at the same time.  I get goose bumps when she hits those pure notes.  The songs range from shades of Motown Janis Joplin Sade and so many more. What a great compliation of songs. This is why people used to buy CDs.
"Adele is my new favorite singer. The way she changes her voice is phenomenal. ""Set fire to the rain"" brings tears to my eyes."
"Adele's cd is a must-have for any lover of music. Her incredible voice heartfelt lyrics and bluesy tone should and can be appreciated by everyone. My favorite songs are ""Someone Like You"" (of course) Set Fire to the Rain and Turning Tables... but they are all wonderful. I expect many more Grammys will fly her way in the coming years."
What a powerful voice she has.  Was worth getting on my kindle as well as the cd.  If only I could get my music from my laptop onto my kindle
I can listen to this album over and over again.  Adele has such a wonderful voice and all of these songs are produced so beautifully.  This is just one of those albums that everyone should own.
I liked the few songs that were played on the radio and while I didn't think she was an exceptionally good singer I thought her voice was okay and I knew she won a lot of awards so when browsing through the sale CD's I saw this and bought it.  Big mistake.  The song lyrics are depressing her voice is gravelly. At times she's actually screaming and she doesn't have a very broad range.  I imagine that it sold so well because people only heard the few good catchy tracks that were on it of course that's usually the case with most albums a few good tracks and the rest are fillers.  From now on I'll stick with downloading individual tracks.
My girlfriend loves Adele and this album. Great album with good sound. Vinyl was high quality and plays very nice.
Every song on this CD was great. I usually do not like every song I purchase on a CDeven if it is someone that I really enjoy listening to but 21 by Adele did not disappoint.If you like Adele I would suggest purchasing this CD.
I love this CD. It is so nice to listen to an artist that is not all studio. Every song is a hero. No zeros.
Love all the songs on this album.  Really enjoy all of the sounds of Adele! Great buy especially when you can download.
My daughter loves this CD and I got it for her for Christmas and she was excited. She listens to it all the time
You can tell Adele has tallent. And it's only made more evident with the backing of money and quality musicians by her side.Adele's album 19 was okay but didn't have the star power 21 does. Rolling on the deep being  what I would call her breakout hit is accompanied by other equally quality recordings.My advice. . . Buy this CD!!!!!
Enjoyed this CD and continue to listen to it now three great songs and a few other surprises as well.
Adele's voice is a breath of fresh air in a stagnant world of so-so musician&#8217;s.  Like doctor Hook said &#34;singing about truth and love at $25000 a show&#34;  Adele is worth paying to see and hear
"Adele Adkins is young but her vocal delivery commands the attention that classic soul singers do. It's a sound that can knock you out with its power and break your heart with its pain. Think of the timelessness of Etta James and Aretha Franklin.By performing masterful interpretations of her own songs heartfelt meditations on desire love and loss Adele gives her white British rivals a serious run for their money from Dusty Springfield to Joss Stone. And unlike neo-soul bad girls Amy Winehouse and Lily Allen whose public misbehavior has at times overshadowed their talent Adele is all about the music.She deservedly won the 2009 Grammy for Best New Artist. On ""21"" her highly anticipated second release she continues the winning streak. Her songs span the gamut from dance numbers like ""Rumour Has It"" and ""He Won't Go"" to intimate string- and chorus-backed piano ballads like ""Turning Tables"" and ""Take It All."" Each is beautifully written arranged played and sung. My favorite is the haunting operatic torch song ""Don't You Remember.""The lead single ""Rolling in the Deep"" is already a radio and video sensation and while the rest of the album doesn't quite have the irresistible force of that track it's never less than excellent. Another personal favorite is ""I'll Be Waiting"" with its perfect harmonies and horn section on the chorus. It's a standout track and a candidate for Adele's next hit single. Her cover of ""Lovessong"" by The Cure gives the song a stunning transformation.Please check out her Tiny Desk Concert at the NPR website in which she presents three numbers with only piano and guitar accompaniment: ""Someone Like You"" (the sad and lovely final track from ""21"" now at the top of the British charts) ""Chasing Pavements"" (the hit from her first album ""19"") and ""Rolling in the Deep."" If you only like Adele's sound now I promise you'll be both blown away and hooked by the end of the 15-minute show.An exclusive version of this album distributed by Target stores came with a bonus CD containing four tracks: a concert version of ""Need You Now"" (featuring Darius Rucker) and live acoustic versions of ""Someone Like You"" ""Turning Tables"" and ""Don't You Remember."" It quickly sold out but you can find it used on Amazon. There's also a limited edition import with two bonus tracks: ""If It Hadn't Been for Love"" and ""Hiding My Heart."""
Though not every song is a winner Adele has a great voice sometimes reminding me of Rory Block.  She is not syrupy sweet a welcome change
Adele has such a remarkable voice and the we have enjoyed listening to this CD over and over again.  If you like Adele this is a great CD.
Fantastic singer.Every one of her hit LP is Great. She has great selection of music. I recommend this LP. Listen.
"The first time I came in contact with Adele's music was when I watched the ""Rolling in the Deep"" music video on MTV. Up until that time my concept for Adele (rather inaccurate I confess) had already been established: she was probably just another flat-out boring pop star...I mean when was the last time the #1 spot on Billboard had been hit by an actually GOOD ARTIST? (that's just my opinion...hahaha). But when my ears ""layed eyes"" on the song I stopped and put down my remote. There was something about that ""we could have had it aaaaaaaallllllllllll"" that gave me goose-bumps...and that voice...heavenly :) That same day I opened up the youtube video and just kept playing it for the rest of the day. I can safely say that Adele is now a favorite of mine and I'm so glad I have this record.As for the album itself ""Rumour Has It"" (awsome sassy vocals and instrumental arrangements...love the piano interlude) ""Set Fire to the Rain"" (if the chorus doesn't set it I don't know what will!!) ""Rolling in the Deep"" (really contagious beat which someone played her heart to) and ""I'll Be Waiting"" (the most cheerful song on the record) are my absolute favorites. There is nothing wrong with the second-single ""Someone Like You""(which by the way has a beautiful chorus) but it just doesn't stand out like the others I listed. The ony set-back I can think of is that the CD doesn't come with the lyrics...but you know some artists like to leave the interprtations of their songs to the listener and that's fine ;)She has come a long way since her 2008 debut and I'm anxious for her next release (and I've only listened to the album twice!!)."
I am really enjoying listing to Adele; this cd has great music and unusual arrangments. She deserves the musuc awards she won this year.
COR BLIMEY GOVNER WOT IS THIS TRIPE? I'D RATHER BE SWEEPING THE CHIMNEYS THAN THIS. YH SHE MIGHT HAVE A NICE BOAT RACE BUT IT ALL ENDS THERE IM AFRAID. Y WASTE UR TIME LISTENIN 2 THIS UTTER RUBBISH WHEN YOU COULD BE WATCHING EASTENDERS? I WOULDNT PAY A SCORE FOR THIS NOT A PINKY NOT A TENNER DEFFO NOT A POUND. I WOULDNT INSULT MY QUEEN BY PAYING WITH HER BOAT RACE FOR A CHEDDA CD. I'D RATHER RUN UP AND DOWN THE APPLES AND PEARS THAN LISTEN 2 THIS TRIPE!!! I WOULD BE STRETHCING ME PURSE STRINGS IF I WAS 2 PAY A PENNY FOR THIS. I'D RATHER SIT DOWN WIV ME WIFE AND READ THE SUN AND HAVE A NICE ROAST DINNER AND A NICE UP OF CHAR. (OR TEA AS U POSH BLOKES CALL IT!!) AND THEN WAKE UP IN THE MORNING AND HAVE A NICE FRY UP!!! THEN CATCH THE RED DUBBLE DECKER BUS AND GO TO WORK IN LONDON AND COME BACK IN A BLACK TAXI!!!! TA FOR NA MATE. IM OFF FOR A PINT AND A PACKET OF PORK SCRATCHINGS. *BURP*
"I love this album.  Every song is very good and half of them are exceptional.  Two are great!I heard ""Someone Like You"" at lunch at a fast food restaurant and tagged it with Shazam.  I then searched for Adele on YouTube and found ""Rolling in the Deep.""  I checked the song prices on Amazon Digital and on Google Music and decided to buy the physical media from Amazon.  Two days later I ripped the CD and uploaded the songs to Google Music; I dig Amazon Prime.The odd numbered tracks (""Rolling in the Deep"" ""Turning Tables"" ""Set Fire to the Rain"" ""Take It All"" ""One and Only"" ""Someone Like You"") are the best but all eleven tracks are very good."
"Adele rode in on the wave of white British Girls worshiping at the altar of Etta James and Dusty Springfield and seems to be the one left standing after the initial landing. ""21"" finds Adele discovering her own personality (primarily through a busted relationship) and pours her soul into every space available. From the bridge-burning of the first hit ""Rolling In The Deep"" to the torch version of The Cure's ""Lovesong"" she has matured in two short years into a first class singer.She works out gospel in ""Take It All"" to a Tina Turner (ala Ike and Tina and the Ikettes) fire on ""Rumor Has It."" The production ranges from the gentle and soft piano on ""Turning Tables"" to overblown - ""Set Fire to The Rain"" is way too compressed and comes off as screechy. It may be a case of too many cooks as ""21"" boasts six different producers. I'd personally like to see Adele hole up with Rick Rubin (who gets one of the best performances out of ""The One and Only"") or Ryan Tedder who also co-wrote a few of the songs including ""Rumor Has It."" Overall though ""21"" has the air of a timeless record just as easily digested now as it might be in a decade. If Adele can avoid falling into the trap of trying to be trendy her approach to music making is going to serve up some classics."
This is the best album of hers. She is awesome and deserves everything she gets. Stay strong against the pressures of fame.
Adele has got a clear smooth crisp sound. The content is a little repetitive but still great to listen to.
I can't say enough good things about Adele her voice in un-matchable.  She just touches you with every word she sings.  Love her.
Every song is as good as the next.  This is the cd when I want to sing my heart out and not care if anyone is watching.
This is the first Adele CD I have bought and I am hooked. I am so glad that I bought this one. It is amazing!!!
This album is a must have for every music library.  Her voice is unique and mesmerizing.  The songs on this album are so full of emotion.  I absolutely love this album!
Adele was the best singer of 2011 and still is the best singer  today theb my 2nd favorite is celine dion because she wrote nd sang the Titanic theme song my heart will go on but adele is the  best singer
Some of the songs on this cd are what got me first tuned into Adele. This cd is my fav. I love to sing at the top of my lungs to her songs! They are powerful lyrics too
I usually listen to country music but I kept hearing songs from this artist while traveling with my boyfriend and I finally decided that I was going to find out who was singing these songs! I was surprised when I found out that it was an artist from the UK! I decided to download the album and buy it as well so I could listen to it and needless to say I haven't been listening to country music for at least 2 weeks now! I think I have &#34;worn out&#34; this CD because it is so fabulous! I urge everyone who usually does not listen to this type of music to give it a try! She is a very talented and wonderful singer! I hope she comes out with some new music soon as I cannot wait to hear it!
"21 is a great album overall.  The first track ""Rolling in the Deep"" may be the first single and most known song but not the only jewel here.  ""Rumour Has It"" will bring up images of Motown's great past and ""One and Only"" is a unique and inspiring love song suitable for downloading and sending to someone as a love letter.The cover of The Cure's ""Lovesong"" is the most original I have heard.  A wonderful mix of Adele's soulful voice and Spanish-style guitar.  Excellent album."
"No autotune no hype - thank God. With the entire pop music industry going down a slippery slope into a vortex of scum Adele is the pinicle of a rare few who actually display class and talent. No tats to speak of no shards in her lips no dressing up like a circus act just one hell of a voice and song writing talent. I have heard that young people are taken with her and maybe just maybe they will begin to see that to be really unique free and different you have to go against the flow and truly be your own person. In 2011 there is nothing more lemming-like than to paint your body pierce yourself with cheap hardware and spike your noggin-hair. Yet ""artist"" after ""artist"" come along and sport this contrived image and then sing through another contrivance (autotune) and then pen lyrics that amount to some goofy repetition of some meaningless sophmoric phrase. For God's sake somehow someway music has to return to music to art and get away from being a forum for gangsta thug rump-humping displays of lowbrow sideshow culture.Adele on the other hand needs no showbiz distraction to take your eye off the talent search. You listen to her you have found the real deal. Yes I agree with some others that her influences are very apparent and she has not surpassed the likes of Aretha but she is bringing back the focus on real talent and for that she deserves a thousand Grammys."
I purchased a Adele 21 CD and I am quite disappointed that the CD has skips on it. Track 8-9-10 can't be enjoyed because of the stop and start stop and start then it begins to replay the track all over again. My CD player is a BOSE and I never had skipping before with a CD.
Ordered this for a present.  It's strange to me but good.  However this will be the only Adele I'll buy.
"No one is more surprised or more pleased by the success of Adele than me.  Listening to the excellent ""Chasing Pavements"" for nearly two years I wondered if she would ever be able to break through in America.  With the release of the monolithic ""Rolling in the Deep"" I was happy to see her continuing with good music but figured America would give it a pass.  Boy was I wrong!  The album 21 debuted in America and a few months later ""Rolling in the Deep"" cleared the top spot on the HOT 100.  It began to overtake nearly every genre of music the kind of mainstream appeal no British artist could find in America since Leona Lewis' ""Bleeding Love"" three years earlier.  Suddenly Adele and her music were everywhere:  Tv appearances a concert DVD and every other commercial and promo.  Shows as disparate as ""Rescue Me"" and ""The Lying Game"" used her songs to promote their seasons. The second single ""Someone Like You"" became her next number one hit and became the first ever piano-only ballad to hit #1 in America.  Third single ""Set Fire to the Rain"" also hit number one and this album was the best seller in the country for more than 20 non-consecutive weeks.  It also led her debut album 19 to an incredible second sales life and finally a boatload of Grammys.  Fourth and final single ""Rumour Has It"" is impacting radio more than a year after the album's release.  This album by Adele's own admission about a failed relationship contains universal themes that have led to it being the best-selling album of its time shift millions of copies in the digital age.  The album opens with ""Rolling in the Deep"" the biggest hit of 2011 and a towering single that brings to mind the classic Wall of Sound production associated with Phil Spector.  The accolades presented this song are many and are deserved.  In a world of Autotune and 80s rip-off synthesizers this song is Adele's voice heart and soul rather than a computer.  Simply put amazing.  Track two is the current single ""Rumour Has It"".  With its undeniable dream beats courtesy Ryan Tedder this song tears into your brain like few others.  It managed to be a radio hit a year before its single release!  It is paired with the fellow Tedder tune ""Turning Tables"".  This quiet song may be the most haunting of the album.  Its simple production complements Adele's vocals and renders the song truly special.  This is followed by the pleading ""Don't You Remember"" in which she implores a lover to remember everything they had together.  Next up is ""Set Fire to the Rain"" an oxymoron of a title reminiscent of ""Melt My Heart to Stone"" from her debut album. This track speaks to how many feel when betrayed; whether in love or life the song is applicable to more than a few of us.  ""He Won't Go"" is a song in which she defends the similar positions of both herself and her lover seemingly to a captivated audience.  ""Take It All"" finds Adele describing herself as a crumbling fool and it all works.  ""I'll Be Waiting"" is an unashamed promise to be better when her lover returns.  ""One and Only"" is perhaps the most unabashed love song here and is a thing of beauty.  The penultimate song here is an excellent cover of The Cure's ""Lovesong"" a song that very much fits in with the theme and spirit of the originals here.  The album closes with ""Someone Like You"" a quiet ballad that has deservedly become a massive hit.  With some of the most poignant lyrics to hit pop music in years this song is certified to bring listeners to tears.  Even if Adele retired tomorrow she has staked her place in the pop pantheon.  Hopefully listeners will get to hear music from her for years to come and if we are lucky it will be just as amazing as what she's produced so far.Tommie Conrad Author of ""Windswept"""
I've been a music lover since Bill Haley and include all types of music for my listening pleasure.  I happened to see Adele's Video of Paladia while getting ready for work one morning and I was hooked! Honestly I'd never heard of her! I couldn't wait to find her CD and buy it!  She's got a great soulful bluesy style super range andperfect music accompanying her.  I'll be listening for her next work.
"I sure did like this year's Bob Schneider CD the new one by Stevie Nicks and also Radiohead's ""King of Limbs"" but Adele wins hands down for ""21.""  Her performance here is perfection."
I like to listen to a great variety of music and do not buy cd's because I normaly only like the music I hear on the radio or at friends place but this Adele 21 is one of the best investments I have made for my listening. Adele is fantastic it does not matter what she sings and I am very happy with my choice. Well done amazon for your great variety of music and reasonable prices.
it is complicated there is too much room for error I think amazon is making a fortune off of their MP3 purchases because it is too easy to buy music you don't want and never asked for. Come on Amazon you don't need to be sneaky about it. We are loyal to you and are making you rich. Your website is awesome the White House should have hired you to set up the Affordable Healthcare website! But please stop insulting our intelligence when it come to music purchases!
Got it fast and of course got it on time very fast and easy thanx for the fast shipment :)
This album has strong vocals and powerful instrumentation. The tracks are interesting and display unity. Her voice is beautiful while having a bit of a rough edge on it. The songs display her vocal talent well. I would recommend this to fans of well performed music.
"Like many others I am besotted with Adele. The only wrinkle I have with this album is that the version of ""Someone Like You"" on the album is not as good as her live performances (e.g. the ones on You Tube).  It is overproduced and she also makes some note choices that detract from the simplicity of the emotion.  There is an interesting YouTube video where she talks about each of the songs -- they should have included maybe a transcript of it in the album.Still better than everything else out there period."
Her voice is  well you all know phenominal.  Absolute pleasure to listen to my daughter wants to someday sing like Adele.  She is her role model and this CD doesn't disappoint. I can't think of anyone better to have  as a role model.
Am enjoying listening to Adele's 21 CD since it arrived in great condition and quick too. Amazon is the best!
It's Adele!  Not much more needs to be said.  It's a great album which I already had a digital copy of but thought would sound even more awesome on vinyl and I was right it sounds great on vinyl!
Nothing short of AMAZING is ADELE's 21 in stores Feb 22ndBe sure to check out 21 Days of Adele: Everyday leading up to the release date new Adele content is released  [...]NPR is streaming 21 in it's entirety on their website take a listen before you buy it!: [...]
Perhaps I was oversold.  From the build-up I received I was expecting another Sarah Brightman or Lara Fabian.No such luck.  I mean the lady is okay even good perhaps but nothing special nothing exceptional.Probably good for some background music.  But no magic here.
this is probably the best album i own.  I still listen to it regularly and recommend it to anyone who likes good music
The first time I heard Adele sing was on some tv program and I only caught part of the song.  Her music is fantastic and I absolutely love it.
There's a reason this album is still selling gang-busters.  It is beautiful and amazing.  I never get tired of it.  I can't wait for her next album.
Great recording the sound is amazing! It has been in my car CD player since it arrived I cannot get enough of it.I recommend it to all those who love Adele.
Very happy with purchase and thrilled to hear all the songs on this album. She has a beautiful voice for someone so young and very talented !!
I can listen to this album over and over. There is a  profound maturity to her voice and musical styling that she was still finding and defining in &#34;19&#34; .Adele's  pain and passion come through quite readily. She has a wonderfully powerful voice.Everyone will find something to identify with in this album from the humor in &#34;Rumor has It&#34;- (I snicker every time I hear it.)To the  Passion in &#34;Rolling In the Deep&#34; I desperately want to sing along fortunately wisdom prevents me from doing so in public.
I absolutely love this CD and the best one I have purchased that every song is great on it. This CD is the best I bought in several years.  I listen to her everyday in my car and never get tired of hearing it. After buying this one I will have to checkout her earlier CD's and can't wait for her next one to come out.
This is a wonderful album pressed onto a horrible LP.The sonic quality is just not there. The album has surface noise right from the get-go. Furthermore like many new release albums I bought in the last few weeks this is all packaging and no quality lp album. The lp itself has a melted spindle hole that ran over the label the lp had finger and hand marks and scuffs from poor handling during production. These marks are permanent and can not be removed.This is the third new release new pressing album to arrive in this condition.This is fraud guys....vinyl is dead on arrival if this is a comeback at all...
"I listened to this album based upon all the ""soulful"" hype and rave reviews this album received.  She is a talented artist but I was not impressed by this album.  I did enjoy He Won't Go Love Song Someone Like You and to a lesser extent Take It All.  The band backing her is more than adequate.  I'm just not that into her sound.  She reminds me of a female John Legend... another artist loved by many whom I can take or leave usually the latter.  Actually I am inclined to see Adele as the talented sound-child of John Legend and Bonnie Raitt.This album is just not for me.  I will get my soul elsewhere."
"This is the first CD that I have purchased by a ""new"" and to me unknown artist in more than a decade.  I won't spend my money on flash and trash and the disc better feature great songs on better than half of the tracks it carries.  Adele's 21 more than meets my standards.  I really appreciate her comment that she felt her music was for the EARS not the eyes.  She writes some fine lines and her vibrant voice conveys the emotions behind those words wonderfully.  One of the few times that just reviewing the music samples on Amazon sold me on the artist."
"Again the tonally deaf have allowed themselves to be conned into believing this woman who strains her way through the high notes as though she were constipated is talented. When she attempts to prove she CAN sing and tries to lilt between high and low notes in the same chorus/line she sounds ever more awful and desperate. Then she fails to pronounce ""HURTS"" as ""HURTS"" opting for ""URTS"" in a momentary lapse to her Eastend of London roots all the more so making for a grating listening experience.  But...if the majority think she is the best talented singer to emerge in years...why not jump on the bandwagon and laud her ""talent: even though there is none.That I am afraid is the position of many who are unable to make it through the day without having someone else do the thinking for them. I on the other hand have had my fill and more of this over hyped talent free woman courtesy of Virgin Fm here in Toronto who play her songs with relentless cruelty repeatedly throughout the day that I am not going to even contemplate buying her cd. I know what is in store for me and I thank Virgin Fm which is piped through the speakers here at work for drumming it into my head that this woman simply is unable to sing to save her life.I hold her boyfriend responsible for leaving her and thereby ""inspiring"" her to sit down and pen her sob story into awful songs with which to torture a gullible easily led public. I would not be surprised if by the end of her recording this awful cd she had a bad case of hemorrhoids given her constipated tones. But the tonally deaf and easily led will stream to the stores and buy her cds so they can identify with each other and appear to have musical kudos when in reality they wouldn't know musical talent if it hit them in the face!!! Let's see if we will be talking about Adele a year from now and raving on about her next release...lets see!"
I grew up in the 80's my ears & eyes filled with some of the greatest music of all time the artists everyone knows & a lot only a few of us remember. I listen to it all- Madonna MJ The Kingston Trio Herb Alpert Travis Tritt- I'm no snob. Good music is good period and genre alone doesn't define what's good. At one time I owned over 600 CD's and truly would've considered myself an audiophile. But from turning from an idealist into a pragmatist from having religion to having none I fully acknowledge that I am not a happy person by nature. I'm a glass-half-empty kind of person. I like to complain about the hideous nature of the modern musical industry pop & country especially and commiserate with friends about absurd concert ticket prices the lack of talent around the endless tanned & blonde-haired twits calling themselves artists etc.- things that we all have to endure. I hate 99.9% of the work put out today and to buy an entire album is something I've done only once in the 2010's. This is that one album.I won't compare Adele to other artists because people do enough of that. I won't break down every song for you here or attempt to convey deep & mystical insights into the work- that too has already been done. For me this album is about pure pleasure. Pleasure to listen to it the whole way the first time through pleasure to get more out of with each listening pleasure that I didn't just find one song on an album that's halfway-decent (nearly unheard of now). So I'll leave it short & sweet for you. Every track has it's own personality. From the rousing beginning through the ending every emotion is conveyed yet the artist manages neither to oversing or undersing. She sings about love & relationships things I normally care nothing about & have heard about ad nauseum. I'm the kind of girl you take to a movie about Soviet submarines not chick flicks. How Adele's gotten the songs just right how she's somehow made it all fresh to me again I have no clue. Why I love it so much beyond the obvious talent of the artist is not explainable. I just do. Not overproduced or underproduced the musicianship of the backup players is great (particularly the pianist) but not obstrusive. In a soulless glossy size 0-world that's quickly going down the tubes I've found one itty-bitty oasis auditorily. For that Adele I thank you. Young you may be in years but not in voice nor in soul.I listen to this album daily all of it and it gives me a glimmer of belief that maybe not all is lost either in music or in reality. Hear it all yourself. Hopefully you'll feel the same.Peace wherever & whenever you can get it.
I was floored by her first album and still think its one of the best I have ever heard. I quickly bought this album expecting an even better recording but was extremely disappointed. There may be 1 good song on the whole CD. She is trying way too hard and sounds really commercialized or country or just crap. Sorry but I will not rush to buy her next album.
I bought this gift for my wife and she is very pleased. She listens to this CD everyday. Thank you very much.
Adele's voice deserves five stars the audio production on this CD deserves one star - it very much lacks the transparency that would let Adele's voice sound its best.  There are other sonically ugly things going on as well - some of the instruments have a tin can sound to them.  Adele sounds better in every other forum in which I've heard her - from the Grammy's to live radio broadcasts.
One of the best cd's I have.  You cannot miss if you purchase this.  The music and lyrics are so REAl.  Her cover of the CURES lovesong  is so poignant you want to find ur special one and snuggle.  Order ir you won't be let down at all.
"I have to say that when i first heard ""Rolling in the Deep"" on the radio i instantly liked it.  So decided to buy the cd since it was so reasonably priced here on Amazon....You know how sometimes you take a chance when buying a cd just b/cuz you like the one song but hope you like the rest of it.  Wellsurprisingly i like at least 5 of the songs Adele sings on this albumit is amazingly good i am really happy that i purchased this cd!!!"
"I cannot add a lot to the great Reviews on this CD. However if you must choose between Adele's ""19"" and ""21"" -- choose ""21"". There are easily three or four major hits on this album and quite a few great songs for any single album. Usually you're lucky if an album contains 1 or 2.My favorites must be everyone else's -- ""Rolling in the Deep"" (which is slang for both being embroiled in a great deep love and/or a painful break-up or despair over a love gone wrong) and ""Someone Like You"". ""Set Fire to the Rain"" is gorgeous as well. Methinks Adele is the only person who can do justice to these songs since she wrote nearly all of them.My God! Such a great talent!"
Love it!  Her voice is strong and real! No gimmicks. No lip synching. Adele can sing! I have not been 21 for a long time but I enjoy her too.
i think that this is a fantastic album and she also has a one-of-a-kind voice that no one else has. i would recommend this to people who love one-of-a-kind music. she is fantastic.
This young lady can sing I bought the album for one song and ended up loving every song. What a find I hope we will be able to enjoy this artist's music for a long time.
It's fantastic! I have never received so much pleasure from listening to music. The whole album was auditioned in the same breath. I just fell in love with her voice! And I became a devoted fan of her!
This is a great CD and I live the artist. The artist has a very powerful voice and her songs are superb.
This is an awesome album and Adele at her best. I think it is a collection of her best works to date.This is a purchase that would be considered money well spent and you can not beat the fact that about30 seconds after you pay you have the music to enjoy listening to it's a win win buy listen and enjoy.
The CD arrived quick it was a great price. I would definitely recommend purchasing from this buyer again as I plan to do..
My car is a 1999 Rav4 so no mp3 player hookup.  CD's all the way for me until I buy a new car.
So glad I bought this CD initially for the single hits that were released but found other songs just as enjoyable.
Heard Adele on the radio and was captivated by her voice her heart and her tenderness.  This CD is wonderful -- keep them coming!
Such a beautiful voice. My favorite is &#34;Rolling in the Deep&#34; though &#34;Turning Tables&#34; is also a great tune. Well I really think the whole album is great...
I bought this cd for basically just 1 song but i have found that i like quite a few of the tracks on the 21 cd.  Adele has a beautiful and unique voice and she is very talented.  Thanks to Amazon for the speedy delivery.
This is a great CD! Has several top rated songs of Adele from the radio. Would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Adele.
A great new artist coming to light. This is an amazing CD filled with lyrics that the lsitener can relate to.
Adele is a very talented singer.  She could sing without music because her voice is so lovely.  I would recommend for all to buy.
Love Adele!  My first CD of her and it was worth it.  The shipping was fast too!Would make a great gift!
I love listening to this cd all the songs are amazing. I've played this cd almost everyday since I recieved it. I love Adele's voice.
Amazing cd- my new favorite . She has amazing talent and such a beautiful voice. Her words touch my heart and I feel her emotion.
Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it! Love it!  Love it! I guess I would highly recommend it.
One of the best CD's I've ever purchased I play it constantly - her voice is strong emotional personal.  Her poetry and phrasing strikes a chord.  A must have CD.
This may be one of the best albums of the year.  Wonderful bluesy sound and what a voice.  I am in love with this album.
I first saw her perform on TV. She was poised and her performance was professional and outstanding. There were no gimmicks to her act - just the soulful voice. The very next day I went and bought the CD and I was not disappointed.
"A wonderful album by an up and coming artist.  Finding this gem on vinyl was a complete bonus.  Adelle's ""21"" is a keeper; a woman with a strong voice and excellent register.  Enjoy!"
This is one of the best cd purchases I have made in a long time.  So good in fact I bought one for my daughter.  She loves it too!
SOOOOOO good!! Adele has an awesome voice.....Good listening music!Received the CD in just a couple of days. Excellent service.
I love her voice and style of music soulful rich in tone with a depth that is well beyond her years.  Every song is delicious and stirring. I can see why she is up for artist of the year. I know I will be a follower.
I'm a very new Adele fan.  I caught her performance on Ellen before Christmas 2010 and became an instant fan!  I've counted the months and days until this album was released.  I am sooooooooooo in awe of her voice and the compassion it exudes on this album.  It was sooo worth the wait.I'm a grandmother of six a lover of all types music from Led Zeppelin to Rascal Flatts; from Floyd Cramer to The Black Keyes.  It takes something that reaches out and grabs me by the heart...stirs my deepest emotion and yes makes me cry...to get added to this old lady's playlist.10 out of 11 songs on this album do just that.  I'm not going to bother to identify the one that moves me the least simply because I still love it.  It just didn't ZAP me.  But holy hell 10 out of 11?  That's amazing!Favorites at this writing are:  Rolling in The Deep (of course) Rumour Has It and Set Fire to The Rain.Adele the sky's the limit lady!  Keep cranking them!
In James van Praagh style of writing those of us who have lost children can find comfort and some piece of mind that our children are still with useven if it is not in a way that we prefer but nonetheless must accept.
"I can't fault Adele's material at all.  Her bluesy and soulful style is addictive and seductive.  Like the ""Adele 19"" album ""Adele 21"" is packed to the gills with great music.It's the sound quality that is horrible.  Regardless if which format you buy this album (or the previous one) on the same fatiguing sound quality rears its ugly face because the entire album has been butchered by the recording engineers' use of dynamic limiting.  This is the extreme electronic compression of the sound's dynamic range - the compression of the difference between the softest and loudest passages of the music.  What we end up with is a stuffy congested sound quality that is very loud.  Drums sound like they're being struck by cotton candy rather than drumsticks.  Adele's vocals are also ruined by this because it sounds like she is actually singing with the microphone in her mouth!  I honestly can't listen to more than one song at a time.XL Recordings the recording label for both Adele's albums is no stranger to the practice of limiting.  They obviously won't change their ways and they don't have any incentive to since both albums have been certified multi-platinum.  But Adele can do herself and us a favor in the future and sign a contract with a label that cares about good sound.  The Verve or Blue Note labels would do her (and her listeners) good."
This is my first Adele CD. I enjoy just listening to her sing much like I enjoy the way Barbra Streisand sings. Alone on the stage without the dancers backup singers and the &#34;show&#34;.
This chick can really sing. She has a very subtle yet powerful voice. Make no mistake about it this is an incredible album. Now I have to get 19.
What more could I say about Adele? This album is amazing her songs are great and her voice is perfection.
Yeah yo Adele has got it going on. Smokin' stacked body and the voice. Having seen her on the Grammys last night I am as equally impressed with her multi fasceted vocal range as I am with her wild cockney british accent reminiscent of the old lady characters that you see on Monty Pythons Flying Circus... wow! I'm diggin plus she's a brick house!I actually aquired this album a while back about two weeks before it was even released actually and instantly realized that it would become a Grammy winning album of the year (as it did seven Grammmays) It may not be everyones cup of tea but it has all the elements that make a timeless record. Great songwriritng (notice that in the Grammy song of the year category all other nominees were songs witten by at least seven people each. It should not take seven writers to write one song! Adele did the whole album with herself and one other writer...)Anyway Adele can smack me around all day. Maybe get rough on that Katy Perry chick too! I bet Adele could kick the crap out me either way and I am extremely turned on by this. The album is great you know that already.
"The Adele ""21"" CD is an excellent presentation of the stellar music of this artist. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who is interested in this venue of music."
i love her voice and also the lyrics of this cd. so for me this was her best  cd. hope to see more of her work.
I love the music.  It is great if you want to wallow in melancholy for a little while.  It will pick you up and comfort you a bit.  I like to listen to is while I am doing other things.  She has a great voice very mellow.
Adele is remarkable she is such a perfect act all alone... even my grandbaby 2 years old love her and sings her songs RUMORE HAS IT AND KNOW THE WORDS.
This album is incredible; if you liked 19 you will LOVE this album. Great voice great style and interpretation of music great lyrics- couldn't ask for more. There is a reason she won 6 grammies for once the industry got things right! I play it all the time since I bought it months ago!
Given that she writes her own songs she could have released a single and saved us all the burden of plodding through  the entire rehashed bemoanment.  Yikes.  I need a drink.
I bought this album on the same day & before Adele got the Grammy's.  I did not watch the Grammy's & found out the next day that she won quite a few Grammy's.  I loved her voice so I bought it from Amazon.  I'm glad her voice has recovered.
5 stars for Adele's voice.Love most of the songs but got a bit too heavy when you listen to the whole CD in one hit.
Like the heading says how can you go wrong with Adele answer you can't...Enough said. 5+ stars what a singer and song writer....
Love Adele !  I was going to give this as a gift  but ended up keeping it for myself !
Absolutely love this CD !!!!!!!!!!!!!  I like a variety of fast and slow paced songs---and she delivers. :-)
I purchased this CD for a Birthday gift after hearing most songs on the radio.  This was a great CD for gifts.
I can listen to her voice for hours on end...will need to look at getting other cd's of hers!LOVE IT!
Adele's sophomore effort is an excellent album with several seriously fun tunes. I love the way she melds soulful lyrics with her rich voice - brava!
The CD is great--the cracked jewel case thanks to bad packaging is awful.I mailed this to my mom for a treat as she'd wanted it for quite some time. She was so excited to get it but didn't tell me about the broken case since she didn't want to sound ungrateful. I noticed the damage for myself when I visited her yesterday.Very disappointing order experience due to careless shipping.
A wonder of a voice for sure but I'd prefer to hear what she can do with a songthe way her UK mate RUMER can. Her songs LOVESONG and SOMEONE LIKE YOU are nice.
What can I say? The more I hear her the better I like her and the greater the realization just how good she is.
I have come recently to Adele's music. It must be good; it has sold millions. For mine it's a great piece of work.Beautifully written played sung recorded and mixed. It is an examination of love and loss which is by turns defiant sad reflective and so very real. Adele never holds back. So for those of us who have loved and lost listen alone through good equipment and turn up the volume.ps It's an album in the old way; play it right through in the original track order.
There are an amazing number of songs that have received lots of airplay.  Great CD from the start to the finish.
In a world filled with disposable music and artists this one is a keeper & a classic! Would recommend this to anyone.
I love this artist.....adele...adele... and product came sooner than I expected...there's not a day that doesn't go by that I don't get in my car and listen to this artist amazon the great place to buy anything and everything you could possibly want or think of and I love their customer service in the way they  protect you they also protect the vendor....i like that...thank you amazon...witt witt
Never bought any Adelle album's before this one but I heard my wife listening to this one and had to buy it for myself.  Fantastic mix of her soul music and almost Joplin like vocals (but cripser).  5 stars.
My Pilates teacher uses her for the workouts time to by the music and not disappointed and am a guy.
When I heard her sing on television I had to buy this album.  Consider she has had 4 hits off this one album.  Really a super super album.  If you haven't heard Rolling in the Deep you have missed a real treat.
Adele's sophomore release is even better than her first.  Her lyrics are amazing and capture the human experience of breaking up.  Love this album.  Buy it immediately.
Adele is someone to watch as she matures and grows.  Her voice and the songs she sings are timeless.  A true joy to listen to this new song collection
This is a fantastic album it marries soulful singing with hard edged beats that permeate your mind. Adeles' lyrics can fit situations of the past and present no matter your age and her voice will keep you coming back for more. A must have for your collection.
"To experts and critics I say I may not know what's good but I know what I like.  When searching for new music satelite radio isn't much help.  I wouldn't last 5 minutes listening to top 40 commercial radio so I turned to friends who do listen.  Those who know my tastes recommended I give Adele a listen and I really enjoyed her.  In my case I clearly preferred ""21"" to ""18""(?).  I'm looking forward to following this artist and hope that her work continues to appeal."
I really like it.  Even though I'm more in to bands like Metallica Five Finger Death Punch InFlames Three Days Grace etc. I like Adele also. I think she has some good music.
"I liked ""19"" but OMG..""21"" has just blown me away.I waited for a while to claim it ""Album of the Year"" (for me) as that is what I felt in March but I felt I give it a few more months but I can't see any other project that come along at this point in the year and take that Title away from Adele.While many can ""sing"" only a handful can write and express themselves the way Adele does. I do think that is really what makes a ""timeless"" project Vs just a good singer who lucked into a hit song. This is the type of music that whatever ""American Idol"" show they have 2040 they will be singing songs from Adele.Can't wait for the award season ""21"" is going to be hot!"
What a great singer and song writer!!!  Each song is better than next...!!!  The entire cd is great!!!  I totally enjoyed it.
She has immense voiceheard her music before but not till James Bond movie that I want to hear more of her.With the suggestion from daughter to order Adele 21 and here we are great voice.
I found everything to satisfactory. The sound was up to par and she is always good. No complaints here at all. Download and enjoy!
I love her voice! She just sends me into another world with songs. I didn't realize she had so many songs that I enjoyed. She is a cross-over artist that identifies with every emotion!
Maybe the single most powerful voice to come along in decades inimitable style and amazing song writing! If you want to be moved emotionally as well as viserally I'm talking about the hairs standing up on the back of your neck Adele's 21 is the CD for you.
"There are so many 5 star reviews here that mine is hardly necessary but I like this album so much I just have to chime in.  I love every track on this album but several are outstanding.  ""Rolling In the Deep"" has that pounding baseline emphasizing Adele's soaring vocals.  I quickly got addicted to this song - it just pushed my betrayal buttons.  ""Rumour Has It"" does likewise - it's such a great classic bluesy R&B; piece.  The sad note she hits in ""Turning Tables"" and ""Someone Like You"" is truly beautiful.  I guess in the end what I love is how it genuinely touched my emotions in a way few complete albums still do.  Bravo Adele!(PS:  Downloading saves plastic trees ;-D )."
great voice i bought this cd as a present for someone who really likes Adele however I enjoy listening to her at times.
She is so beautiful... every song on this CD is great.  She has a very earthy and deep tone to her voice.  A little country with some Rock.
if u really like her songs i can say that u don't really know what is MUSIC. She is okay for me but people's overrated r making me sick. people said she is so talented if u want to know what is called Talented listen Celine Dion Whitney Huston Mariah Carey Beyonce Christina Aguilera. I wanna suggest this to people.
Hard to fairly rate a singer who's sold so many copies yet she has such a soulful forceful distinctive and emphatic voice.
Adele is one of the best artists around.Her voice is beyond others in her genre.Love this alblum. Sweetness.
I play this CD over and over.  Such a great voice.  You can feel the emotion in her singing.  Would reccmmend to buy this CD.
I heard Rolling in the Deep on the radio months ago & never realized who sung it until I heard the grammy nominations. I listened to the clips of the other songs on this album & decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. Her voice is beautiful. I am not disappointed in this CD at all.
I love all the songs on this album by Adele. I regularly purchase music here on amazon. Appreciate the selection
I saw the video for Rolling In The Deep and I liked the song and the video itself.  I bought the cd on a whim hoping to get into Adele.  It was a risk and a new discovery for me.  I played the cd and so far I only like 3 songs on the entire cd.  I like Rolling In The Deep Rumour Has It and He Won't Go.  I think the song He Won't Go would be better suited for an actual R and B singer though.  I think the reason I'm not fully into Adele is her style of music (not into the whole 60's thing) and her voice ironically.  After a few songs I find myself a bit annoyed with her same style of singing.  I think she should take more risks with her voice and change it up some.  The raspy thing is a bit grading on the nerves and the howling like a wolf thing is also annoying.  I am also not crazy about the excessive ballads on the cd.  Lyrically this is a good album though.
"Incredible CD every song is beautiful and perfectly sang.  A must have really.  This is the only CD that I actually bought the physical CD.  Last time I did that was Whitney Houston's album ""I look  to you"""
Super CD Lady Gaga music is entertaining!
Don't know what people are talking about. The entire album and digital booklet is in my cloud drive ready for download. The CD is amazing!
Bought as a gift CD's are CD's. The disc was in the box and worked well in the CD player
Good sound.  I'm to be honest just getting to know her music mostly because of grandkids...they love dancing to her video.  Wanted cd for car.
Great set for Born this way. Also has the HBO special in DVD form. I wish it included the Born this way country mix but other than that it's a great set for the money.
"I've waited for ""Born This Way"" ever since GaGa announced she was recording material for a new album even when she didn't release a title. I kept listening to more and more singles right when they come out and now we finally have Born This Way a brilliant album! I got the album yesterday (the day it came out) and I heard it the same day. I couldn't be more impressed. The lyrics production and everything is AMAZING! This album is on fire!It begins with the opening track ""Marry the Night"" (my favorite). It's very soft and wedding-like in it's first 30 seconds and turns into a thumping electronic songs with great lyrics. Great way to begin the album! Then the next track is ""Born This Way"" and of course everyone's heard it but it's still a hot song with phenomenal lyrics and production. I was excited to hear the actual version of ""Government Hooker"" (the 2 1/2 minute Mugler version was already on fire when it was released to the internet) and it was awesome! The chorus and that thumping beat is amazing. ""Judas"" is fourth track and it's an awesome song. I heard it when it premiered on the radio and I obviously loved it.It's one of those GaGa songs that have a certain message so nobody should be thrown off by the title.Lady GaGa shows some diversity on ""Americano"" where she speaks some Spanish lyrics over a Latin-electronic beat. It reminds me of the song ""Desnudate"" from the latest Christina Aguilera album. ""Hair"" is an amazing track. It has fantastic lyrics and everything about it fits perfectly. It was definitely promo-single worthy. ""Schiesse"" was also a song I couldn't wait to hear the real version of. (The DJ White Shadow Mugler remix that's also on the Disc 2 of this album was released on GaGa Daily in February and ever since I've been dying to hear the real version and I'm so impressed! She managed to pull off a thumping German-electro song showing even more diversity (and languages) on BTW. ""Bloody Mary"" is one of my favorites. It's one of those spiritual GaGa songs (that still throw you off with the title). I love the verses and those thumping drums are awesome.""Black Jesus + Amen Fashion"" is yet another spiritual GaGa song with a throw-off title but it's awesome! I love the lyrics and production. ""Bad Kids"" is a great song too. The lyrics and chorus are my favorite parts of the song. ""Fashion of His Love"" is a great 80s throwback and it's a pretty cute song. It's great. ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)"" shows a bit of drama and I love it! It's a standout on the album.""Heavy Metal Lover"" is definitely one of my favorites! I love the chorus and that beat is amazing! ""Electric Chapel"" is the next track and it gets a bit mellow in the chorus with a nice electronic beat. ""The Queen"" is one of my definite favorites also. I absolutely love the meaningful lyrics and everything is done extremely well. ""You and I"" is the first song that GaGa released so it definitely is important. The lyrics (that always mention Nebraska) are amazing and it works well as the second-to-last song. ""The Edge of Glory"" is my 2nd favorite. It's dedicated to her late granfather and it's beautiful. Everything is wonderful and it's the perfect fit for the closing song.The Disc 2 with 5 remixes is absolutely awesome! It starts with the Contry Road Version of ""Born This Way"" and I absolutely love it. It's the only country song I like (I absolutely HATE country by the way). It's the best version of BTW. The ""Judas (DJ White Shadow Remix)"" is another great and thumping remix dub from DJ White Shadow (his BTW remix was amazing). ""Marry the Night (Zedd Remix)"" only includes my favoitee part of the song (the chorus) once but I still love the zippery synths and loud beat. The ""Scheisse (DJ White Shadow Mugler)"" is a great 9 1/2 minute remix that I first heard in February and I realized the kinda remixed the remix itself. It sounds PHENOMENAL! It closes with the amazing ""Fashion of His Love (Fernando Garibay Remix)"". A great dance remix to a great song and a crazy good way to end the remix disc.Born This Way is an applause-worthy winner of an album! It's one of my favorite albums ever! It showcases GaGa's extreme talent (and diversity of languages like Italian German Spanish) along with crazy vocal talent and it's truly an amazing album. Can't wait for more GaGa! Paws up!"
Her Born This Way album was not something I fell head over heels for right away. Of course I loved Born this Way and Edge of Glory but the other songs didn't do it for me during the first run through of the cd. But now that I have had a chance to listen to them more and pay attention to the lyrics I am in love and happy with our Mother Monster. The song I am most surprised I love is ScheiBe. I don't understand most of the lyrics but the beat is catchy and I find myself singing it even if its not playing. Marry the Night is a great slow song with a nice melody and Americano is just fun. I hope everyone gives the cd a second or third chance to really listen to the lyrics after they purchase this cd.
I have listened to this album a couple times and have a few short conclusions:1. The songs are catchy - I have had a couple stuck in my head over the past few days.2. Although they are different many of the songs sound pretty similar.3. There is a creepy Gaga voice on a couple tracks that I can't stand so I have to skip them.4. I can't understand half of the lyrics because of her diction. (I'm 23 so I should be able to understand her right??)I didn't buy her first couple albums but I'm glad this one only cost me 99 cents. She could have done better.
Thank you Gaga for the exceptional music. Thank you amazon.com for pulling the wool over our collective eyes.The MP3 download specially priced at $0.99 is censored. To my knowledge amazon.com did not disclose that the album is censored anywhere on the info page. In my opinion this is tantamount to fraud. I will stick to iTunes on principle and never download an album from amazon.com again.Innovative approach to record sales and a valiant attempt to conquer the iTunes monolith. However you just lost a music customer.
Born This Way is an album that seems to speak directly to my soul. Within every song I recognize a part of myself a part of my generation. Gaga did an amazing job writing songs that speak to youth today addressing the problems we face the insecurities we have to deal with and the struggle of self discovery that each of us must go through. This album reminds us that it's okay to stand out and that if we're not happy with who we are in this moment that we can continue to grow and change until we become the person we've always wanted to be. Fantastic album from start to finish thank you Gaga.
Well...after she bragged this album up as being the best of the decade I had high expectations especially due to the fact that I am still in love with the Fame Monster...How could you not be...Speechless Teeth Bad Romance Telephone...etc...This CD is very good in spots but only in a few...Sorry Little Monsters...I do love Gaga and what she stands for but I have to be honest here...Born This Way is a great song...Hair has a great beat and melody but some of the worst lyrics I ever heard.  Judas is above average but I had to skip past Americano which is one of the worst songs I have heard in a long time...skip now to the end...You and I and The Edge Of Glory are the two best songs on the album and are among her best ever.  The other 9 tracks should have been left for a B-sides compilation...
EASILY the best of all her albums HOWEVER I don't see it fitting the taste of most of my fellow Americans. Too bad for them.INCREDIBLE ALBUM.
My daughter is a huge lady gg fan and loved this album. She loves to listen to it all the time
such a great ackage for any true little monster i highly suggest i mean you get the whole package a movie and 2 CDs! came in great condition
The price is a great deal. The only problem is that the entire album does not download. Only received a few of the songs. This is the first time I have ever purchased something like this from Amazon and it will probably be the last.
Bought this for .99 cents the day after it came out. Most of the songs i like... judas is a little funny... too much gay pride for me. But all around a good cd for .99 cents.
This is a great album for anybody to enjoy. Some songs make you question but Lady Gaga's music is all just amazing.
"Although it's rather ""in"" to be a Lady Gaga fan I am a huge fan of that silly Mother Monster.  And when her new album ""Born This Way"" was finally released (after months of insane hype)--I was on that like white on rice.  So what is my verdict?  Well to make a short story long I think that the album although somewhat disappointing is ultimately a very good record.  I must confess that her previous release ""The Fame Monster"" is one of my favorite records of all-time.  I loved that entire album from the very first time I heard it blasting out from my car stereo speakers on that icy November day.  It may be a bit unfair of me to judge her latest work against that standard (as any artist will tell you ""This is what I'm doing now"") but I can't help but feel a bit nostalgic for my dear heart-breaking Alejandro.Much like her first album ""Born This Wa""y has some excellent pop songs.  Does it completely excel in all areas of stereo-phonic bliss?  No much like the Judas she sings about it really can't be trusted.  To be honest the production on some of the tracks is far too overworked abrashive and confusing.  Song like ""Americano"" and ""Government Hooker"" suffer from too much going on thus it transmits poorly across my TIMESPACE.  Even the aborted single ""Judas"" sounds (as a dear friend of mine put it) like ""she just threw it up"".  And don't even ask me about the mess that is ""SchieBe"".  The combo of generic euro trash beats and a cheap Arnold-esque impression does little to seem innovative or even fun.  Definately one song for the hardcore fans.But that is not to say this is not a ""great"" record.  Compared to other pop music it excels where others fall.  Lady Gaga seems quite genuine in her love for her art and a desire to make music that means something to her and her listeners.  ""Born This Way"" does its job fusing disco pop euro rock and 80's arena anthems into one solid collection.  Songs like ""Electric Chapel"" are odd enough to be arty but fun enough to make you feel good about cranking it up to max volume.  Also check out  her current single ""The Edge of Glory"" album track ""Bloody Mary"" and the stand out anthem ""Bad Kids"".  I also highly suggest you if you are so inclined pick up the deluxe version of the record.  It contains the fantastic tracks ""The Queen"" and my current fav ""Fashion Of His Love"".  Also included is a throw-away ""remix"" disc with crummy dub style mixes with the soulful country mix of ""Born This Way"" thrown in.At the end of the day the album will do very well.  And I'm sure Lady Gaga will continue to release singles remixes and tours based on this body of work.  However do I hear any ""Bad Romance"" ""Just Dance"" or ""Telephone"" massive single explosions here?  Nope.  I don't.  And that's okay."
Full album for .99 as a special on the release date. Excellent idea. If you think you will like one or two songs it is cheap enough for you to buy the whole album. Other songs may even grow on you. New soon to be super pop songs like Marry the Night and Highway Unicorn are already holding a place in my heart. It's great to have some new Gaga at this price.
This is not working! I was so excited to buy this album for only .99. I downloaded it to the cloud and I am only getting 5 of of the songs. What is going on? The previous reviewer said they only got 2 songs. Who do we contact about this? I realize it is only .99 but it still should work.
Beware!! Only 1 song and pdf album cover downloads. Not the entire album as advertised.I have purchased from Amazon before and also have their cloud player. Amazon Coud is a useless rip off. Will have to dispute credit card charge.Negative rating is for Amazon Cloud and NOT for the artist.
This is probably one of her best albums yet! Everyone should buy it. The music is very catchy and easily gets stuck in your head (which is a good thing) =pEvery song has a different message to it one of the best motivational albums I've ever bought. I love Lady Gaga.
Born this way is the best album I've ever bought. It comes with 22 songs and each individual song is pure genious. Many of the standouts of the album include Born This Way Judas Marry the Night Schiesse Americano but in my opinion they're all fantastic. It is a very wholesome album covering numerous genres and it includes a second disc with great remixes. 5 stars
"Wishing I'd just bought the mp3s and downloaded them directly instead of using cloud player.  Only two show available the others are all ""being processed"" and it's been half an hour already.  No good."
Born This Way is an excellent third album from Lady Gaga. While the songs on the CD sound extremely similar to Madonna (an artist she is often compared to) they are still unique original and very enjoyable to listen to. If you enjoyed Lady Gaga's first two albums this one is definitely for you.The Special Edition comes with a few additional tracks as well as a second CD of remixes which I would consider worth the extra money. Also in my opinion the album art for the Special Edition is much better-- the motorcycle cover of the regular album looks awful.
"THIS ALBUM IS EXHAUSTING AND SATISFYING LIKE THE BEST SEX YOU EVER HAD!This is Gaga's master piece (so far)Every song is beautifully crafted it's an experiment on electronicaAt times the beauty of it all is so surreal it cannot possibly be reality! I thought it had to be a dreamSome of the songs take longer to digest than others but every song here is a winner so much art I thought I would die of Stendhal Syndrome! Gaga has done it again!! She slays and scalps the lesser bitches!Favorite Songs in no particular order:- Marry The Night- Born this way- Goverment Hooker- Judas- Americano- Hair- Schiebe- Bloody Mary- Highway Unicorn- Heavy Metal Lover- You and I- Edge of GloryThose are the more ""immediate"" songs I think but the other ones:- Black Jesus Amen Fashion- Bad Kids- Electric Chapel- The QueenAre just as beautiful but took me a little longer to digest them they are somewhat more alternative perhapsThe album is gorgeous and so full of energy it's exhausting!EXHAUSTING AND SATISFYING LIKE THE BEST SEX YOU EVER HAD!"
Sorry but I just do not care for the new album.  Alot of the songs sound too similar and the singing isn't nearly as good as previous albums.  I give it 2.5 at best.
I had a great time listening and singing along at work however one day my download was gone.  Not sure what happened/ what I did...  Not sure how to contact tech support- any suggestions?
Lady Gaga does not hold back! She delivers with such power and wit showing how she continually grows and evolves as an artist. This is the album OF THE DECADE!
"And yes this is her second album unless Lady Gaga says otherwise herself.The Fame Monsterwhich had 8 measly tracks was an EP and her best until this strangely inviting album came along. At first after listening to the samples I wasn't so sure I was gonna love this album because some of the production seemed second rate. The choruses to ""Judas"" and ""Americano"" weren't helping either as they seemed thrown together. And they are. However this album is just short of being a masterpiece. Tons of tracks get a 4.5 to 5 star rating here because of their killer dance beats but mostly cause of their charm.Some people were crazy enough to give this album one or two stars but I guess I have to respect their opinion. However in my opinion it's hard not to love a lot of these tracks as a Gaga fan who started out kinda as a hater. I just get it now.My least favorite track is actually the mix to one of my favorite tracks on the first disc called ""Schei&szlig;e (DJ White Shadow Mugler)"" which is on disc 2. Worst track on disc 1 is probably ""The Edge Of Glory"" which is just an alright bunch of lyrics slapped to a dance beat. I just don't really think it's a classic like many think. It's OK though.My favorite on the deluxe version by far is ""Fashion Of His Love"". I've played this wonderful track as well as ""Judas"" the most so far. The former is an all-out 80's dance dream about being insecure about love but at the same time being faithful. There are many references to her late fashion designer Alexander McQueen which the song is also about and dedicated to. Other favorites are the extremely catchy ""The Queen"" the infectious ""Black Jesus + Amen Fashion"" the ride-or-die anthem ""You And I"" (Beyonce might have found inspiration from this one for her mid-tempo ""Rather Die Young"") and ""Judas"" with its mean beats.Surprisingly unlike her first albumThe Famethere aren't any bad tracks per se just 2 average ones which were mentioned at the very beginning of this review.Lady Gaga is a fierce force to be reckoned with in the music industry and this album shows that. Stealing nearly all the limelight and attention making you turn your head for better or for worse she is definitely a trendsetter and somewhat of a visionary when it comes to her craft.Born This Way (Special Edition)is a one of a kind album that could possibly go down in history as a dance pop classic thanks to its topics that constantly push the envelope (as well as people's buttons) and production that pays attention to detail when you least expect it. Definitely her best yet and you'd be crazy to not pay the extra cash for the 3 exquisite bonus tracks as well as the 5 mixes.4.6 stars.Buy the album. If notDOWNLOAD:""Fashion Of His Love""""Judas""""Schei&szlig;e""""The Queen"" &""Black Jesus + Amen Fashion""SKIP:None actually."
"Lady Gaga has done it again! Born This Way (Special Edition) is a solid and breathtaking album from start to finish. Hard to believe this talented woman is only 25 years-old! Of course I had my doubts about this album beforehand since The Fame and The Fame Monster are two of the best and most creative pop albums of the 21st Century! Everyone seems to have an opinion about ""Mother Monster"" - and so do I! Gaga is the the best thing to come along in modern music since Madonna. Both are highly driven both are highly talented and both are masters at writing and producing high quality pop songs. Born This Way is a very diverse album of sorts. I have breaken the album down into categories:Dance Songs:Marry the Night (the strongest song on the album).AmericanoScheibeBlack Jesus + Amen FashionSensual Songs:Government Hooker (love how passive-aggessive her vocal is here).Heavy Metal LoverReligious Songs:JudasBloody MaryElectric ChapelSelf-Acceptance Songs:Born This WayBad KidsHair (another highlight)The Queen (Gaga's best vocal ever).80's Inspired Pop Songs:Fashion of His Love (Gaga channels her inner Whitney Houston).Highway UnicornThe Edge of GloryAnd there's one Power Ballad called You and I.What I admire about Gaga is her lyrics are so relatable and how her voice sounds so different on each song. Love her or hate her you got to give this vamp credit for all that she's accomplished in such a short period of time. ""Don't be insecure if your heart is pure - you're still good to me if you're a bad kid baby."" Amen to that!"
There are so many gems on this CD. Judas Bloody Mary Marry the Night to name but a few. Some of the songs do feel more experimental in nature but I am okay with that. Overall the entire package is a sold work and a great value for the number of hits it includes. A must have for your GAGA collection.
Best Album from HER yet. Keep up the Good work Lady Gaga. Mad props to you thank you. Looking forward to you keeping us entertained.
"People rating this album with low stars are doing so because they only listened to the samples. If you're going to make a purchasing decision this way go to YouTube and listen to the full songs before immediately labeling this album a failure. A lot of these songs take more than a first listen to get hooked. And once you do get hooked...you get HOOKED. People are immediately giving the thumbs down because this is a huge departure from her ""Just Dance"" days. Well I loved ""The Fame"" as well but anyone can agree those were the days where she was most influenced by her label. ""Born This Way"" is more of Gaga's pure talent and to see this album get such low ratings is a pity.TAKE THE TIME TO LISTEN MORE BEFORE YOU GIVE LOW RATINGS. That said I paid full price for the album before I saw this deal and I don't care. This is definitely the album of the year!"
Okay like everyone else I purchased Lagy Gaga's new album and saved it to the cloud drive BUT my download wouldnt show the whole album. So I tried a 2nd time. This is a note to EVERYONE DO NOT I REPEAT DO NOT download the album to your cloud drive because it WILL NOT download. Use the Amazon MP3 Downloader and it works perfectly!
This is my first bought Gaga album. She definitely delivered. I can hear rock elements (my fave genre) and 80's beats. Completely obsessed with most of the album. I recommend this to any genre music lover. It doesn't disappoint.
this is the first time i have purchased an album or any music on amazon and i must say what a deal the entire album for 99 cents. UNREAL!!!!  this music is great but i am having trouble putting it on my ipod/itunes.  i was wondering if anyone knew how to do that because it does say it is compatible with ipod's.
This Album represented a style change for Lady Gaga. She shifted towards less electronic infused music that shows she is capable of growing as an artist.My favorite track is You and I a ballad that shows off Gaga's ability to sing and turn an original piano riff into a great sounding hit pop song.
"I can't believe how many negative reviews there are for this album due to Amazon server issues. What do you expect when they offer one of the most highly anticipated albums in years for $.99 on the date of its release? Of course there are going to be server problems when millions of user are downloading the same album all at once. But anyone who's ever downloaded an MP3 off of Amazon knows that MP3 downloader keeps track of failed downloads and allows users to try again later. Folks need to relax and wait for traffic to die down and then try again. Don't blast Amazon for practically giving this album away. Consider how much of a hit Amazon is taking in lost revenue. Learn patience and gratitude folks!As for the album itself it's excellent. I'm not a huge fan Lady Gaga or her genre but this is definitely one of the best albums I've heard in awhile. Every song makes me want to get up and shake my booty. ""The Edge Of Glory"" is particularly powerful and hypnotic. ""Poker Face"" fans will especially enjoy ""Highway Unicorn"" which shares Gaga's famous hook.How long did it take me to download the album? About 20 minutes and 3 ""Retries""."
"Possessing a Doctorate in Dance Music and a talent large enough to match her out-sized persona Lady Gaga gifts her Little Monsters (as well as the rest of us) with the stunning ""Born This Way."" If you're familiar with the first two singles ""Born This Way"" and ""Judas"" but are not impressed take heart. The balance of this CD is an instant classic.Hitting with the force and intensity of an F5 tornado ""Born This Way"" is a dance floor tour de force sampling a wide variety of genres of dance music and a broad range of stylistic influences. Obviously there is Madonna (though Lady Gaga has a true powerful voice) but I also heard hints of Bruce Springsteen (""Marry The Night"" complete with sax work from E Street Band member Clarence Clemmons) Santa Esmeralda Grace Jones and Abba - to name a few. Yet ultimately it is all thoroughly Lady Gaga. Listening to ""Born This Way"" I was reminded of Beck in the way she has digested her various influences and returned it back to her listeners in fresh new forms.Perhaps this CD's biggest strength is the razor sharp songwriting. Lady Gaga knows how to write a killer hook and how to structure a song so that it corkscrews into your brain and booty and won't let go. The production and engineering are pristine. Even if the Lady G is not your musical cup of tea you can't help but be impressed with the sonic storm she and her cohorts have whipped up.If I have any quibbles at all it would be the lack of a single ballad and a certain thematic sameness to several songs. That said I loved ""Marry The Night"" ""Government Hooker"" ""Bloody Mary"" ""Electric Chapel"" ""You And I"" and the brilliant new single ""The Edge Of Glory.""In sum ""Born This Way"" will rule the charts and radio for the remainder of 2011 and maybe into 2012. If you don't like it or her you need to find somewhere else to be because Lady Gaga and this special CD will be EVERYWHERE. It is now truly Lady Gaga's world and we just live in it."
There isn't much to say. This album is unique fresh and EARGASMIC. THE EPITOME OF POP POINT BLANK PERIOD!!! LOVE YOU GAGA!!!
"With her latest album Lady Gaga is once again revolutionizing pop music. Born This Way is an amazing album and is both unique and complex. Without a doubt compared of all her albums this is Lady Gaga's most different album. The style of the majority songs are not what many expect from an artist like Gaga or from other artists. Because of this all of the songs on this album are unique and fresh and extremely interesting to listen to something very hard to find in many modern albums. Additionally the variety of the genres and styles of songs on Born This Way also contribute to the album's uniqueness.While listening to the album I realized that all of the songs are very intricate and complex. Beside being well made and produced each song on the album has a deeper message than what is heard. If you think the songs on this album are just like the many other songs about the usual topics such as love drugs or sex you are wrong. Force yourself to look beyond the surface of Gaga's songs on this album. For example ""Hair"" is a song about one's hairstyle as a way to express their identity and freedom ""Judas"" is a metaphor for facing one's past and forgiveness ""Born This Way"" is a song about everyone having the potential to be great and to achieve many things in life regardless of sex race sexual orientation etc. and ""Americano"" describes Gaga's disapproval about unjust immigration laws in the United States.In conclusion I rated this album five stars because it deserves each and every one of the stars. Many of the songs on this album are pleasing to listen to while some are great for dancing to and others can uplift spirits when you're down. Due to the variety of  songs found on this album I suggest listening to every one of the songs on this album. There is a good chance you'll like at least one of the songs. In my opinion Lady Gaga's genuineness and dedication as an artist is clearly evident in this album."
Very good the product arrived on time in a very good contitions I am very happy with it! Go fot it with not problem
Let's be honest: I was extremely worried about the outcome of Gaga's second full album Born This Way. I wasn't a big fan of Born This Way (the song) and Judas took an extremely long time to grow on me. I was thinking she was really going to crash and burn for once. But then I downloaded the album. And I listened. And then I listened again. And you know what? It's really terrific. However there are going to be a lot of people who just won't get it for whatever reason. The album is full of club ready music it's not watered-down electronica per the Black Eyed Peas style. It's truly authentic electronica. I mean listen to Scheisse and Government Hooker. Honestly Gaga is an artistic genius but she's a true artistic genius one who refuses to go against the grain of her art to appeal to the masses. If the road strays toward the public that's ok but if it doesn't she's cool with it. I think that's the biggest reason I admire her and her force in the industry. The absolute musts on this album are Americano Edge of Glory Government Hooker and Marry the Night! You go GaGa!
"Just pre orderedAlpocalypseby Weird Al Yankovic and it came with a free .99 cent credit towrds an mp3 purchase. Since Lady Gaga was kind enough to approve Als parody ""Preform this way"" after some idiot working for her said no my credit goes towards her album as thanks. Not so much a huge fan of that style of music but am a huge fan of her sense of humor and appreciation of her fans. I have no problem supporting that. My girlfriend on the other hand will love this album."
"For seconds I thought I was listening a Madonna album!Katy perry J.Lo and Kylie Minogue latest albums are superior than this "" born this way""I thank to Lady gaga that she can sing very well in live performance."
It downloaded the digital booklet and that's all. Very perturbed.Love the music though hence the 5 stars.
"This is album is the most happy and magical album you will ever find. All of the songs on the album relate to loving yourself and not being afraid to express who you really are. It is Lady Gaga's best album yet! If you haven't gotten it yet you need to get it NOW so you can experience a musical adventure that you will never forget. Love You Gaga!!! "" Paws Up"" X"
"Just don't expect a reply for support within the 12 hours like it states here on Amazon.  A few tracks didn't download with their ""Amazon Downloader"" software.  After less than 24hrs the links to retry downloading expire (50+ tries and I kept getting the ""download failed"" error).If you buy the whole album don't be surprised if you don't get all the tracks.  Check the other reviews Amazon sucks."
I was expecting a bit more from this CD. It was just ok for me. There are a couple songs I really enjoy but not much more.
Niiiiiice!!! I was gonna buy the album at regular price anyways because I am such a big fan but this is great. Her music is worth so much more than the .99 you pay for here. She makes me happy with her non comformist music and off the wall lyrics. Love you GAGA. Thank You AMAZON :0))
I just purchased the CD and Amazon won't let me log into my Amazon Cloud Drive to download the CD onto my computer. ARG. I though there was something wrong with my password so I reset it three times and it still doesn't let me log in. I guess I have to wait until it's fixed.
the upside of this misfire of an album is that she is actually trying. points for an attempt at originality...what mainstream pop artist uses scarification as a gimmick?I am almost speechless while listening to this. Lady Gaga say what you will about her is exciting. It could be for all the wrong reasons but this woman knows how to create a buzz about herself. But this album is so beyond anything typically mediocre...it is an utter slap in the face to the listener. It's attempts at shock value ring entirely false...the second single judas manages to be both dull with its forced attempt at controversy and its blaring and unpleasant beat. The song isn't even fun as a bad pop record. If she was going for pop art she fails on both counts. Born This Way has some spark to it in parts but while the sound of the record itself is in your face the song itself lacks lasting appeal and won't be that iconic moment gaga was so clearly planning. One listen to Hair and it's clear what gaga target audience is: depressed a.d.d. ridden 11 year olds.Slight highlights halt the blood letting. Kids is a bit cute though it's just another insincere pose and thus comes of as condescending. Bloody Mary has a bit of melancholy to it and a hint of italo disco.With this album you are astonished by what will pass as creativity these days. It's just a dull record...the thematic elements fail to be compelling due to her simply not branching out on them. Madonna was an artist that always courted controversy but she was always able to walk the walk and create a superb album as well. Madonna always had fun. This album isn't fun...it's just preachy. It's not something you want to dance to it's more like filth you have to wade through.This album is self indulgent to the point of sheer torture.
"People are saying this is the album of the decade... yeah definitely NOT but it is a very good solid album. Also it is only 2011. There's still 9 years left of this decade people!The deluxe version of the album comes with three new tracks: Black Jesus + Amen Fashion Fashion of His Love The Queen. The deluxe version also includes a bonus CD with 5 remixes. The ""Judas"" ""Marry the Night"" and ""Schei&szlig;e"" remixes are great. I absolutely hate country music so I'm not going to give my opinion on the ""Born This Way"" and the ""Fashion of His Love"" remix really isn't anything special.Also all you people saying that every song sounds the same you must be deaf. I think there is definitely a wide variety of sounds on this album and that makes it an enjoyable listening experience for me.1. Marry the Night - 10/10 - Definitely one of the best tracks on the album. Slow start but builds into a great dance track. Extremely catchy and will likely be a single.2. Born This Way - 9/10 - First single and title track. It's a great pop song with a great message. Does remind me of ""Express Yourself"" by Madonna a bit though. Have to be honest...3. Government Hooker - 10/10 - Incredible. I absolutely love this song. It's so different sounding and lyrically odd but it works somehow. I also love the scream! HOOOOOOOOOOKAAAAR!!!4. Judas - 8.5/10 - The second single. In my opinion it was not the best choice for a second single but it's still a good song. People are saying that this song sounds like ""Bad Romance"" but it doesn't really sound like it to me.5. Americano - 5/10 - Pretty bad messy song. Not sure what it's about either. One of the album's low points. It does have a unique sound to it though.6. Hair - 8.5/10 - Epic sounding power ballad. I love that aspect of it but I'm not too fond of the lyrics. I can't really relate. I like my hair but I don't believe that it defines who I am.7. Schei&szlig;e - 9.5/10 - Such a unique cool fun song. Once again though I can't relate. It's about being a strong independent female and I'm not a female lol. I also don't understand why the German part is necessary considering the message of the song but I love singing along to it. Great song.8. Bloody Mary - 8.5/10 - I love the verses. They're very dark and edgy sounding. I don't care for the chorus much but I do like the part where she says ""I'll dance dance dance with my hands hands hands above my head head head like Jesus said..."".9. Black Jesus + Amen Fashion - 5/10 - Another bad song in my opinion. I just don't get. I like the '90s sound though.10. Bad Kids - 8/10 - Great catchy tune. It's about loving your inner bad kid.11. Fashion of His Love - 6/10 - Definitely sounds like a Madonna song. It's catchy but really nothing that stands out.12. Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) - 6/10 - A very campy and uplifting song. Unfortunately I think it's kind of weak.13. Heavy Metal Lover - 9.5/10 - Hated it at first but it really grew to become one of my favorite tracks on the album. It's a very sexysong. Hard to understand what she's saying though and I'm not really sure what the song is about.14. Electric Chapel - 8.5/10 - ""Do do do do do do do"" Haha I love this song. The guitar the beat the lyrics. I don't know what an electric chapel is though...15. The Queen - 8/10 - Hated this one at first as well but it grew on me. It's the best song out of the three bonus tracks. I love the first half of the song but the second half seems to drag out. The chorus is really good on this one.16. Yo&uuml; and I - 7/10 - An uptempo ballad. Everyone seems to love this song. I do not. The lyrics are great but it's just not my kind of song.17. Edge of Glory - 10/10 - One of Lady Gaga's best songs so far. It's another uptempo epic sounding power ballad with a saxophone solo. The lyrics are well written and catchy. Very good way to end this great album.Recommended Tracks: Marry the Night Born This Way Government Hooker Schei&szlig;e Heavy Metal Lover Edge of Glory. -Awesome songs!"
"On the day this album was released Amazon offered it for $0.99. No better deal in the world except free! My only complaint is that some of the songs have been edited. I didn't realize that this was a ""parental advisory"" album or I would have downloaded it in iTunes for the unedited version. Other than that it's a deal that can't be beat!"
There isn't a thing about Born This Way that I don't love. I already have two tattoos planned of lyrics from this album. Bloody Mary is FANTASTIC!
I like a couple of songs but this album had wayyyy to much hype for what it ended up being... it was worth the 99 cents I paid for it though... just a little disappointed. I think she can do better.. shes extremely talented
"I can't review these songs because I can't download them all.  In my amazon player there are four songs theat are grey and I can't download them.  Any ideas why?  Any feedback would be helpful.  Thanks.Update:  7pm on release day I got this message....I'm very sorry about the issues you've experienced with the purchase of MP3's. Due to the overwhelming response for the MP3 Daily Deal Album ""Born This Way"" by Lady Gaga all downloads are delayed.We're working hard to resolve this issue as soon as possible.We appreciate your patience and understanding regarding this matter."
"THIS CD EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS! GAGA HAS A GREAT VOICE AND IT SHINES IN EVERY SONG OF THE C.D. THE SECOND DISC IN THIS SET REMIXES SONGS ON C.D #1 AND THAT PART OF THE CD IS GREAT MUSICALLY BUT WAS SOMEWHAT OF A LET DOWN FOR ME SINCE ""SPECIAL"" EDITION FAME MONSTER IS SUPBERB.THE MAIN ALBUM IS FANTASTIC THOUGH AND MAY REQUIRE LISTENING TO A COUPLE TIMES TO TOTALLY APPRECIATE ALL THE SONGS. I HAVE HAD IT SINCE RELEASE DAY AND I HAVE NOT REMOVED IT FROM MY CD PLAYER YET!!"
Over two months later and I'm still loving this album.  From Marry The Night to The Edge of Glory it was/is a necessary and wonderful evolution of Gaga's sound yet this time around she sounds more impassioned than ever.  If you haven't listened to it LOUD while driving down a highway you haven't heard it right!  Bring on the tour!
Its pure and simple GAGA doing GAGA.....LOVE ME SOME GAGA...not ment to be usefull....because I dont care if u like my review or not....haha
I have to say that I hope Lady Gaga starts a movement! For once an artist is admitting she doesn't need the money from the album by selling it for $0.99 I almost went to target today to buy the new album but instead I signed into my driod to see what Amazons deal was today and I was floored! I actually looked it up to make sure that it was for real. So if it doesn't download right the first time just try again people you paid less then a dollar!
.99 cents and 20GB cloud storage?  What's not to like.  The album is also surprisingly good.. for a buck!  Thanks Amazon!  You're my favorite online store bar none.
"I would have given it a 5 stars but the packaging lousy for what is suppose to be a ""collection"". Other then that it is a good value on amazon.com for $25. $30-$35 on other websites. Twice as much if you buy each item separately.I love Lady Gaga so that's why I bought this."
This is the first time I purchased a digital download from Amazon.  I had no problems at all and the automatic view in my iTunes library was seamless.  Love it!  I am now enjoying this album.  Love it!
If i could give this album zero stars i would. This album is sooooooo uninspired and directionless. The whole album has a 1980's vibe about it and her lyrics are so literal. There isn't any mystery in the songs or the message of the songs. An 80's flare is cool but she doesn't seem to be able to deliver on the majority of the tracks. If her old fans are looking for theatrical over the top pop songs this album doesn't offer that. What her fans have become accustom to is nowhere to be found on this CD. I guess that's why she delayed the release.She was a normal artist on her first CD and then she let her own 'fabulosity' get to her. She fell into her own 'hype' and just tries to hard to shock people. The Fame Monster was a coomplete departure image wise from her first release. For 'Born This Way' she has literally flown off the handle. The girl has run out of steam. On top of that she doesn't have any 'charisma'. She is not aesthetically pleasing to look at. Her Italian Catholic-Edie Falco-nose looks cute on Stanley Tucci but not her. She has as much charm as a plastic mannequin. Her semi-tomboyish lesbian allure doesn't do a thing for me and most of her songs on this album are just a major disappointment. Not cohesive at all. On top of that she tries to sell the audience her bizzare sex appeal (Which once again is as interesting as a plastic mannequin).I hope she can deliver on her fourth album.Don't be a drag just be a queen. Don't be a drag just be a queen. **I cringe every time she sings those lines**
No one in the industry has her talent. Lady Gaga is one of the most if not the most talented singers songwriters and performers of all time. This album is sure to make a mark on pop culture.
Thank you so much for such Amazon for an incredible vaule and thank you GAGA for such an awesome album!!
I just recently bought this album and have only listened through it once and am working on my second take but one thing is nagging me about this piece. Gaga seems to be dropping a lot of biblical lexicon in her second album. Not sure if it's a good or bad thing or what exactly she's going for by doing so. Proclaiming that she's still a Christian despite her zaniness (I don't know if she actually is)? Shaking a vocal fist at religion? Trying to yet another stunt for attention whether it be postive or not? Only she really knows. Either way let it be known that half the songs have at least a thin veil of a religious overtone to them.Over all the album did not disappoint since she's not really a lyrical master to begin with. So don't buy this thinking her writing skills have improved beyond that Fame Monster. If anything they have been turned down a few notches.Anyway the bottom line is that the album does have its catchy songs but the religious feel coupled with sexual slang might make you uneasy. Don't look into it too hard or you'll fall flat on your face. It's what she might have been planning with this one the whole time.
I read the previous reviews and was hesitant to buy the album.  I don't really like the singles from born this way and with so many people complaining about song downloads I decided to give up.  Then I remembered it's a dollar so I gave it a try and sure enough three songs popped up.  I laughed listened to Americano liked it and went back to my cloud player and 5 more songs popped up.  Something that most people in this day in age are not used to is-- waiting.  I checked my purchased songs and yes indeed I have purchased all the songs from the album.  I'm sure due to the heavy traffic of all the people buying the album amazon is having trouble getting people the songs instantly.  The album is thankfully not as bad as the Born this Way single.  So chill out before you believed that Amazon scammed you out of a dollar that's probably somewhere in your couch.  I'm going to keep checking my cloud player and if I don't get the rest of my songs I'll delete my review and have a scathing one replace it.  So put your paws up and come to the realization that you can probably download the album illegally for free if this doesn't work.
I like Lady Gaga. I think she is a great artist. But I Fame Monster better. I think sometimes she tries too hard to shock or reinvent herself.
I Love Lady Gaga's New CD I would recommend it to anyone looking to find them selves in music. Its amazing buy it!
"I prefer ""The Fame Monster"" with the 2 CDS but this isn't bad.  I just think a lot of the songs sound really similar and kind of run together.  The other one had more diversity with the musical styles.  I don't regret getting it though."
Good album and got it for a dollar. It works great playing straight from my cloud player and downloaded it to put on my ipod. As always no problems at all. And its good to know I can download it any time I need to again from my cloud player.
when i originally purchased this Amazon was having technical difficulties so it didn't download. but now every song is there in my cloud player and its all good. i knew Amazon would come through!i don't recall it saying this version was an edited version. i prefer my music uncensored. if the language bothered me then i wouldn't bother buying it. isn't that why we have free speech laws?the music itself is okay. i like born this way. there are good beats. its not ultra deep philosophy its just good rocking stuff.for those who trash it i say you cant please everyone all the time.
I'm really enjoying Lady Gaga's new album and am grateful for the $0.99 deal that Amazon.com offered us!  I cannot believe how some people act over the download issues.  Amazon.com probably did not anticipate such large demand for this album.  We're all human and make mistakes.  Calm down.  If Amazon.com honors your $0.99 purchase and you get it in a reasonable amount of time (tomorrow even) then I don't see what the big deal is.  People amaze me these days. >.>Anyway I especially love Born This Way Judas Edge of Glory Highway Unicorn and Fashion of His Love! Those are my favorite songs from this album. ^^y
i bought this @ 7am this morning and am working on downloading it to the kids mp3 palyers and burning a disc for the car. i hope amazon offers this deal more often!
"Eventhough I liked THE FAME & THE FAME MONSTER more than this album I really enjoy how GaGa took some of her music in a completely different direction yet most of it stays in the same general area without being called the same. She still has her digital dance beats and piano ballads in others but its the rock factor that really spikes the punch. ELECTRIC CHAPEL & EDGE OF GLORY are 2 of the best songs on the album with surprisingly good electric guitar incorporation. There are others all of them pretty amazing songs. The whole album is really really good so I'm just going to encourage you to really consider HEAVY METAL LOVER & GOVERNMENT HOOKER. Those two songs are just hot. But YOU AND I stands just below BAD ROMANCE as nearing the pinnacle of her talent.I have heard my friends and family say that they listened to some of the songs on this album and they just didn't think it was as original as her first. Many think she is copying off Madonna that whole bit. There are a couple songs (FASHION OF HIS LOVE) that sounds like Madonna wrote and composed and sung them back in the late 80s early 90s. I would have been with her removing FASHION OF HIS LOVE from the track list for this reason and because I think that she could have done the same thing with almost the same lyrics but in a different way. It does fit into the Christian theme that she seems to be trying to incorporate. BORN THIS WAY is one which I have a problem with being so bashed because it is so similar to EXPRESS YOURSELF. Even if GaGa did rip off Madonna I think it is for the greater good. She wrote a song that gives people hope in themselves and their future. The overwhelming majority of the album isn't anything like Madonna past or present. Madonna also twisted this ""reductive"" mishap into a advantageous gag when she mashed the 2 songs on her MDNA tourOnce again I could listen to this entire album back to back. She really seems to have poured her heart and soul into making this record and that has to be why people respect and idolize her. She knows how to take those emotions questions struggles etc and make a great song. Basically Lady GaGa is a spectacular philanthropist. I cannot wait until ARTPOP hits."
I had the opportunity to hear clips of all the songs late last week and I could not wait for the release of this album. Thanks to Amazon for the opportunity to purchase at such a low price. Technology can fail us and I am grateful for the good deal! Even if I had to wait for the kinks to be ironed out. It was worth the wait. This is one album in its entirety that will be played again and again.
Now that it has downloaded I love it!Added 4 of the tracks to my exercise playlist.
"Unlike many others I had no problem buying the album today. I had debated it because I haven't been amazingly impressed with the early music from it (Born This Way Judas) and I just didn't know if I wanted to try it. But for .99 I figured what the heck.It's okay. That's it. Every song sounds the same. There is nothing spectacular differentiating each song from another. Aside from the oft played Born This Way and the also oft played Judas there is nothing particularly different-sounding or ground-breaking about the music (though I didn't have any complaints about any one particular song and ""Highway Unicorn"" and ""The Edge of Glory"" were kinda catchy at times. Granted I am not a Lady Gaga fanboy but I really enjoyed The Fame Monster. I thought the songs were unique and her talent showed very well.This however feels like she's trying too hard. Okay I get that she support gays heterosexuals transvestites et. al. I think that's a great message. I get that she has issues with God. I get that she wants everyone to do what's right and she feels their suffering and on and on and on. But at some point it feels more like she's saying it for the sake of saying it because she in her strange do-what-you-want way is trying to be cool for the sake of being cool. Which just makes it come across as trying too hard-which is exactly what she purports to abhor.Overall it's not bad. But sorry Little Monsters it's not great either and I'm glad I only spent .99 on it."
Love the diversity of sounds and themes on this one. Absolutely great. And I still can't believe I got it for only 99cents!Adding to my workout playlist :-)
I follow AmazonMP3 on Twitter and got the tweet on SUNDAY about the download for 99 cents that day. Purchased downloaded no problems... Been enjoying the album ever since all the while everyone gives 1 star for not being able to download on Monday Tuesday... etc while everyone and their dog is trying to download at the same time. Duh. My tip: open your presents on Christmas Eve people! It's not Amazon's fault that Lady Gaga is so popular. You're getting a rippin deal.. quit complaining. You have your whole life to enjoy this fabulous album! (Translation: follow amazonmp3 on Twitter to get the inside scoop)
Seriously people ALL of the songs will show up!  There's a lag because of the volume of people ordering this album today.  I called Amazon customer service (800-201-7575) got transferred to the Cloud department was told that the songs are coming.In the time I waited on hold I went from having 2 songs + the booklet to 5 songs + the booklet.  I now have 11 songs.The album is AMAZING and it's absurd that it's ratings are being skewed because of technical difficulties.
From the singles released so far I like what I've heard from this album. I figured at $.99 for the album I'd go ahead and get it.So far I only have access to two songs and the digital booklet and I had them transferred to my 'amazon cloud player'. I'm going to guess that Amazon is being bombarded by people buying this digital album and the transfers are queued but not completed yet. I was getting ready to send Amazon a message regarding only being able to get a few items when I looked in my account under digital items and noticed that my order is still being processed.I haven't received an email receipt yet either. I'm going to hold off sending them a ticket for the next hour or two. If the full album doesn't show up by then then I'll go ahead and send a ticket.
So you make an incredible offer don't deliver the goods (downloaded content didn't work) and pull it back (offer expired).  Do you know how much business you're going to lose because of .99?
I thought that this promotion was a good deal and bought it immediately However instead of the whole album i just recieved the MP3 booklet and one music i.e. Electric chapel! Quite disappointing. I do hope Amazon will find a way to rectify this problem.
I usually don't bother with music I am not familiar with but since I do admire Lady Gaga because of her support in the opposition to SB1070 in AZ I wanted her songs.  The disappointing part of this purchase and upload to the Cloud Player is that only 7 out of 14 songs were uploaded.  When I tried to obtain help I got a stock reply referring me to FAQ about downloads and the Cloud Player.  BFD. So until the Cloud Player upload process is easier and more reliable I will not quickly try again.
I have a few words for anyone who hasn't heard this album yet:  Prepare yourself for an all-out pop/metal assault.Interesting how this album hit me.  It started with the obviously catchy title track Born This Way and Judas then absolutely hit me in the face with tracks like Scheisse Americano and Edge Of Glory.Then the fun began because songs like Bad Kids Hair (what a chorus!) Highway Unicorn (Road To Love) and Heavy Metal Lover started burrowing into my mind with catchy hooks and incredible beats.  It gets to the point where as you start to cool to a song that was your favorite for a while another moves to the front as a favorite.Lady Gaga has with the help of Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow successfully blended elements of heavy metal eurodisco Springsteen-based rock vocals and her own kind of outrageous-ness into an unforgettable album.If you like pop/rock music this album is a complete blast to experience and nearly impossible to get tired of.  Obviously everyone has different tastes and favorites but this was the pattern for me.And yes the bonus tracks are worth the money.
"I rarely write reviews but with this album (and offer) Lady Gaga has demonstrated once again that she is the undisputed champion.  The album represents a wider variety of musical influences...and with them a larger palette for Gaga to work with.  Repeated listening yields new discoveries and a deeper understanding of Gaga's true design intentions.  Her message (fundamentally) is so positive and optimistic that in lesser hands it would come across as disingenuous but as any 'little monster' would tell you ""She's the real deal""!In terms of the marketing strategy(was this hers or Amazon's? probably doesn't matter) this is like saying ""I'll let you eat your cake as long as you also take this ice cream"".  Tough decision.  There are a myriad of ""cloud storage"" services out there but 20GB for free along with a $1 new LG album isn't exactly a tough call from the consumer perspective.More importantly and this is why I believe that Gaga had some influence on the pricing it tells those of us who are suffering through tough economic times ""I care about you and hope that when things improve we'll both come out ahead"".  Couple this with a ""you are precious and were born this way"" attitude and LG instantly is our hero.Great music great artist great performer great message genius strategy!!Go Gaga!"
I'll keep this short since I'm sure dozens of other reviews have been written. I enjoy about 90% of Lady GaGa's songs; in fact a few of my favorites are the non-radio-airplay accoustic/acapella stuff.  Unlike many other big female diva names she can actually sing a straight note without autotune being involved and plays a mean piano instead of merely strutting around the stage.I say this as a person who did a little research before listening and actually as a fan who didn't WANT to be a fan. The few songs I don't like are really just about the 'sound' and mood of them. It's rare for me to find an artist where I like 100% of their work. All that being said Born This Way is a solid addition to the discography; I think it helps if you put the weird videos out of your mind when listening. I like the one for Judas but not Born This Way but I like both songs.  A few of the ones near the end of the CD fade into the background if you're not paying attention but overall I'm glad I picked this album up.
I was one of the many that tried unsuccessfully to download the album the first day it was offered for 99 cents.  I tried multiple times over the course of hours without success.  As we know now this happened to many customers.  When Amazon Customer Service responded to my request for assistance they offered to sell the donwload to me again!!  Please help me understand why this could be considered acceptable.
Great offer to give to fans. I was someone that probably wouldn't have paid full price for the album instead opting to buy just a few songs that I heard on the radio. But this offer allowed me to purchase the whole album (which I think is quite good) and listen to all the songs I might have missed out on.
I'm a huge fan of Lady Gaga so I love this album as much as the others. There isn't one song on here that I don't like. I'm happy I got it when it was only 99 cents too!
I bought this with the understanding it would be compatiable with mac and ipod i have yet to figure it out.???Amber
Not the best of her albums but this one is still amazing! I'm especially fond of the German lyrics and the mix of techno with jazz. She's definitely evolving as an artist.
I thought 0.99 cents would be a steal but its not when you cant even download the stupid album to your computer. hello I got to listen to the entire album on facebook for free.
Most of the songs on this album were awesome particularly Electric Chapel Bloody Mary Hair etc. But I had to download that terrible SoundCloud application to get them and that was a hassle in and of itself.
"born this way is definitely the best album of the year. i love the rock sound she has on it. ""heavy metal lover"" is my favorite song on the album. if you dont own it youre missing out!"
"Slow downloading because of the great .99 cent deal but it is well worth the wait for ""The Edge of Glory."" This song is freakin' awesome!!!!!"
It's a really good deal still for $0.99 but It only gave me 6 of the songs. I think if they are going to promote a deal they should at least get it right and give you the whole album if that's what it says you are getting.
The album is amazing. If you liked any of her previous works then this is going to rock your world. The album is super synth heavy and cuts through like a saw beam. The album is full of hits I can't wait to see how many go straight to the top. Gaga did a fantastic job of proving why she is on top of the world. She has taken her singing to a new level as well. All killer no filler. 20 million facebook fans couldn't be wrong.
This album is amazing...I bought it when it first came out and cant help but listen to it daily...she just keeps getting better and better with her music...if your a Lady Gaga fan its a must to pick up this cd...you wont be disappointed
Yeah this is different from her others but in a good way.  I love that she's trying new sounds.  There's dance a bit of country and some rock style in there. Wonderful mix of songs!
Bought the album before 9 a.m. now it's 6 p.m. and I still have only four songs downloaded. Sigh ...
Lady Gaga knocks another one out of the park!  You will love dancing to this album.  Are you Born this Way?
"Of course taking media saturation asidethis is the first time I've actually sat down and listened to a Lady Gaga album. Never honestly paid her much attention. Didn't have to. Personally I feel her one awkward point is similar to that Madonna dealt with at the height of her career. Her whole presentationcreatively and image wise is about non conformity but at the same time the celebrity machine is working overtime in her case. Realizing that this same type of contradiction of approach worked wonders for David BowieMichael JacksonPrince and of course ""Madge"" I'd thought I'd give this one a try. A lot of smart people I know with genuine musical tastes actually spoke quite highly of Lady Gaga. You'd really be amazed howeven in the age of internet just how important the right kind of word of mouth can be. Lady Gaga isin fact a very self contained artist. A singer/songwriter/producer with a flair for the dramatic and for pure shock valuethis quality which could easily deduct points for her creatively actually works very much in her favor. And it will also have an appealing to thosesuch as myselflooking to explore her music past mere surface value.As pop compositionsall of these songs are actually very strong. Sometimes on songs such as ""Marry The Night""""Judas""""Heavy Metal Lover"" and the title song there's all too heavy a late 90'sRay of Lightperiod Madonna influencein addition to the obvious rave/gay club thud Lady Gaga has made something of a trademark. I guess it's being called electropop. Some of that sameness in production is why I deduct one star in the review. However it all plays wonderfully on the club scene however. On ""Government Hooker"" there's more of a colder Eurodisco flavor to the production. ""Americano"" is one strong number hereincorporating a mixture of tango and Habanero dance rhythms in with the disco dance type music. ""Bloody Mary"" is my favorite on the albuma jam on the funkier side of new wave dealing with that delightfully decedent party scene.  ""Scheibe"" brings the German connection into itagain as with all these songs telling tales of social outsiders who are proudly ""born that way"". On ""Hair"" there's this retro wall of sound via E (as in electronic too lol) Street Band soundappropriately featuring Clerence Clemons on sax. He's also featured on the more poppy ""The Edge Of Glory"".""Bad Kids""""Heavy Metal Lover"" and especially ""Electric Chapel"" with it's rock guitar intro have a somewhat cyberpunk edge to them. ""You And I"" is also a fascinating song-kind of a electronic country pop number. It all helps me realize the key to what Lady Gaga is doing with her music here. The filter she looks through is electro rave/dance music. But she brings a lot of the different musical influences that that she embraces into that as well. Musically eclectic artists exists. But they tend to separate their influences out from song to song. Lady Gaga looks into all of her music through that electronic dance filter. Sometimes it's even just outright that. So if your just not too into electronic productionthis might not be for you. But for those who chose to hear beyond it to an artists intentthere's really a lot to admire and love about this. During the remainder of the year after this release Lady Gaga has been collaborating on duets with Tony Bennett that show her potential to be expanding her musical filter into another place as well. Listen to these inventiveoften cabaret and tin pan alley influenced  compositions even outside the production context it's clear to see that Lady Gaga has more than enough potential to expand and improve on her music as time moves ahead."
And that compliment is coming from someone who labeled the album's first single the title track `Born This Way' a complete failure and a horrid rip-off misstep by the controversial artist.  I still feel the same way about that song in particular but after listening to this album as a whole I must say that there is so much AMAZING here it easily offsets the song or two (or three) that I think are terrible.  It's like Gaga is either completely brilliant or just plain awful.  Thankfully there are fourteen tracks on `Born This Way' and I only consider three of them to be terrible (or in that ballpark).You do the math.Consider the singles first.  First there was that awful `Born This Way' but I said all I have to say about that track on my review of the single.  Forget about that song.  Move onto the controversially brilliant `Judas' a song that attacks religious overbearance with fervor and an oddly singed eerie flare.  The bridge is flawless and while the song has called comparisons to Gaga's own `Bad Romance' I see such originality and style oozing out of this track.  Still `The Edge of Glory' which closes out the album is still my favorite thing about the album.  I love everything about it.  The chorus is sharp and catchy; the verse structure is uplifting and fun and that saxiphone breakdown is just so richly original.  This is why Lady Gaga is relevant today!I know that `You and I' is not a `single' yet (or maybe it never will be) but I consider it as such thanks to Haley Reinhart's performance on American Idol.  I know that many `little monsters' are going to take issue with what I'm about to say but Haley did a better job with this song (her smoky vocals added a bluesy country vibe to this song that recalled the great Julie Roberts).  Still it's a GREAT song and Gaga delivers a different side to herself that gives her yet another layer.  I mean the honky-tonk nature of this song is so far removed from the industrial power of `Judas' or the 80's throwback of `Born This Way'.You cannot deny Gaga her versatility even if you once wanted to pigeonhole her.`Americano' is laced with Latin influence and where I felt `Alejandro' failed to impress (I know everyone else seems to love that song including my wife) `Americano' is practically FLAWLESS.  It is high spirited full of lush energy and just bursting at the seams with intoxication.  `Schei&szlig;e' is got such slick edge thanks to the German interlude that rides itself throughout the duration of the track.  The techno base is well used and the rave worthy musical arrangement never disappoints.  This is Gaga paying homage to the great Madonna without crossing over the line of near plagiarism and thus losing her relevance.  `Schei&szlig;e' gets it.  It's a song that will grow and grow on you much like `Government Hooker' will.  This is another song that laces itself with a gritty edge (and that sadomasochistic male vocal is undeniable).  The political statement made is perfectly executed without being preachy but instead becomes a part of Gaga's style.`Marry the Night' and `Electric Chapel' are both songs that I enjoy but the fall slightly away from the `brilliant' term I was tossing at the majority of the album.They just feel slightly monotone.I'm on the fence about `Bloody Mary' because it is so stagnant for most of the track and then about two and a half minutes in the song becomes kind of amazing.  I'm sure after another five-hundred listens I'll think it's the best song on the album.  The lyrical content alone is kind of flawless.My friends totally disagree with me about `Highway Unicorn' and `Heavy Metal Lover'.  I love them they consider them weak offerings.  I don't understand that assessment.  `Highway Unicorn' alone is like one of the greatest things ever.  I love the nostalgic feel to the track and yet it feels so crisp and modern.  Sure the chorus has a familiarity to it that kind of laughs in the face of `originality' but it doesn't matter.  It feels like 80's pop/rock personified.  `Heavy Metal Lover' is also an animal all its own.  It doesn't feel `heavy' at all but far more industrial with hushed tones and a unique nature that makes it stand out as separate from the rest of the album.  It feels more like a piece of music than a song itself if that makes sense (think Lords of Acid type techno).And while I consider `Born This Way' awful it isn't as bad as `Hair' or `Bad Kids' which are just plain stupid.I hate stupid song.Oh well no one album can be void of any missteps and missteps be ignored because Gaga laughed in my judgmental face and proved to me that she was as relevant as she claims to be and as influentially important as the media likes to tote her as being.  She is a strange breed of artist that should not be as amazing as she is but she is and this album will be remembered for years decades maybe even longer as one of those `events' that took the world by storm.I'm calling it now; this puppy is going to land on quite a few Top Ten of the Decade lists come 2019.If you're interested; my ranking.1) The Edge of Glory2) Schei&szlig;e3) Americano4) Government Hooker5) Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)6) Judas7) Yo&uuml; And I8) Heavy Metal Lover9) Marry the Night10) Electric Chapel11) Bloody Mary12) Born This Way13) Hair14) Bad Kids
Judge this cd by the cover. It's just awful. I didn't really listen to more than the first track. Not even sure how I got this thing.
for LADY GAGA! If that doesn't sound like a good deal what planet are you from? I honestly like just a few songs but you cant deny this is a sweet deal. Plus the extra storage you get in the cloud. Just get it.
I love most of the songs.  Yes it is a dance album but a damn good one.  Don't listen to the critics.  You have to make your own opinion.  There is a song for everyone.  Lady Ga Ga doesn't disappoint.  She is weird which I like and not afraid to pull out all the stops.  I would get this album.
Got this on sale for .99 cents and it was a great buy the photo booklet was a perk too!
I am very happy with this CD so very happ I could go insa how many more wor how many more words do I need to write
The album has some great songs on it and Amazon's service is excellent. Yes they were slammed when they offered her whole album for .99 cents but remember THEY OFFERED THE ALBUM FOR .99 CENTS!!!  Possibly the biggest album of the year as well! Give them a break ... also the album is great. If you like Lady Gaga you will not be dissapointed.
I just have to say after waiting for almost an hour for Bloody Mary to download I paused the download and then clicked 'Resume' and the rest of the songs downloaded in less than a minute. I hope maybe this helps someone.
This is mostly a review to help people avoid the hassle of downloading here. Yes it's cheaper. But 3 days later I don't have the full album I paid for and customer service has yet to bother with a reply to my request for a new link so I can get all the songs. So far I'd say I will never purchase songs from amazon again. Itunes is easier faster and well I get my freaking songs that I pay for without having to complain to customer service over and over again. AMAZON: WHY DO I NOT HAVE A REPLY YET? I mean even an AUTO reply would be nice.
She's amazing but this is CD is perfect! No scratches on the disc it came in the original packaging/plastic wrap cover art was exact.  I had this CD before but it cracked so I had to get a new one. This one is identical to my first one. LOVE IT!!
"Lady Gaga's third album is one that is a masterpiece a saga just like her public life and infamous outfits - the party never ends! She continues her musical journey as she introduces more of an old-school ""rock"" sound with more emphasis on guitars (like in ""You and I"") but still manages to keep the addictive dance beat in songs like ""Judas"". She manages to continually top herself since she is the only competitor in her field but she does it amazing gracefully and still keeps true to her roots while changing and morphing. There is no end to what she can create and ""Born This Way"" underscores that point! You must listen to this album because your admiration of Mother Monster will continue to grow!"
I began downloading this CD yesterday morning at 10:30 am just when Amazon was almost crashed by this $.99 14-song CD special sale price hit from the notorious Lady Gaga.  The CD finished downloading at 8 pm last night...and it was well worth the wait!!  I did not even cry for the lost of my laptop for a whole day!!  One listen on my Windows Media Player and I was up late downloading this hit to vinyl--twice--once for the car and again for the stereo system at home.  What a great collection!! Gaga at her very best!!  Thanks Amazon for the great deal....you are truly good to your customers...plus I understand from today's news that you have again made digital history!!  Bravo Amazon and Lady Gaga---Two Class Acts!!
Apparently for this particular album actually listening to it is NOT a prerequisite for writing a review about it on amazon.So here's my 2:Since so many people are rating the album a one star due to a technical glitch from amazon and not because they've actually listened to the album I thought I'd give the album a five star rating just because I like Lady Gaga and not because I've actually listened to the album.I suggest other Lady Gaga fans do the same or it will look like the album itself is a bad album due to all the one stars given it for a technical glitch that has nothing to do with the album...;)
this was a good cd with great music my niece loved it says i'm her favorite uncle just a gag
I had very high expectations but Lady Gaga did not fail to deliver! 5 Stars and double rainbows all the way!
"My actual star rating is like 2.5Honestly I wasn't going to buy the album I heard half of it over the weekend and wasn't impressed. There are really good songs like Marry The Night Born This Way the title track Edge of Glory which is really growing on me and Scheibe. There are songs that will make you think WTF like Government Hooker and Americano. But nothing else really stands out for me most of the other songs fall somewhere between almost good and almost bad.Considering the content it's not nearly as light ""Poppy"" or commercial as The Fame or as deep as The Fame Monster. But for .99 I am so down! So amazon made my night. It's worth more than .99 any day but anything over 7.99 is too much.So I definitely wasn't going to let iTunes get my money.This is the second time amazon provided a great deal on an album I wasn't thinking about purchasing. Also if you don't get all the tracks the first time just keep hitting retry. It took about 3 tries to complete the album for me considering the number of people probably trying to download it I'd say that is pretty decent.Good job amazon!"
I LOVED THE ALBUM IT WAS DEFINITELY DIFFERENT THAN HER FIRST ONE BUT THIS ONE WAS MUCH MORE MATURE I LIKED IT
Amazon acknowledges that there has been a technical issue with this download.  There is no ETA for solution were given explanations are very vague. Though there is no download available and the tech support does not tell when it becomes available Amazon has no intention to  take off this promotion album from its web site until the issue is fully fixed. Is this a scam???  Please  don't waste $1  your time and your nerves!
Another great album from Gaga!!!! This album definitely has a great sound to it! There are definitely plenty of songs to dance to and she also delivers powerful messages!
Lady Gaga you are truly amazing with your digital partnerships! I cannot believe how much I have been hearing about this highly anticipated album with partnerships with Google Chrome Zynga and now Amazon.  This is a great promotion as to create urgency with people buying the album instead of downloading it for free somewhere.  I was going to purchase her album at Target like I usually do with new albums because they usually have a deal for $9.99 or something along those lines but I mean you cannot beat less than a buck.Granted it took a couple hours to download but its because I was on a wireless network.  It went faster with some people with a better connection.Also the great thing is that you do get a digital cover- a PDF with 14 pages about the songs etc.  This is better than the actual  CD because when I buy the CD all I do is go on my computer rip it onto iTunes and transfer it on my iPod so this just takes one less step and for 90% cheaper! Thanks Gaga and Amazon!
"When I first heard Gaga's music I thought I was hearing Madonna remix. Deja vu.Don't fault me as I spent my late teen years listening to Madonna's every song up to date you really can't deny there are some similarities between the two - in a good way.Finally I hear the new generation of ""meaningful worthy"" pop ( Britney Christina sorry you are not there at all... ) before I forever taking Bach with me to the grave.Personally I prefer to have a CD ROM to preserve a ""hard copy"" but since Amazon has the cloud drive and the price ( it was 99 cents on Monday 5.23.2011 for one day only for the whole album. )is too good to pass I figure I should give it a try.Working in technology company I know such a good deal for such in high demand artist is going to put any network in jeopardy even for Amazon. So I expect it is going to have tough time to deal with the sudden massive download ( remember how Victoria's Secret fashion show brought down the Internet many year ago ? ) . I waited until 11PM US Central time to do my purchase and it's just like that in a split second I have the whole album on my cloud drive and download to my PC.So for me I have no complain but satisfaction on the download part.The music is good the deal is great. And I did my first digital album purchase in a perfect fashion."
"I was a bit worried when I read all the bad reviews about not being able to download songs by other customers before I clicked the ""Buy Now"" button anyway. I trusted that Amazon would solve these problems if not already. As it turns out I didn't have any problem downloading the entire album so I am guessing Amazon had already successfully solved the download glitch. Good job Amazon!! Thank you for this AMAZING DEAL! I am still listening my way through the entire album I do not think it is as good as her previous ones but I love Gaga anyway!!! I do hope that her next one will bring more surprise though."
The album is awesome but Amazon I can't listen to the album. I can only listen to Marry the Night. Please fix the download problem.Update: Amazon fixed the glitch. The album is great.
I was surprised when I got a notification via email from Amazon that they would exclusively be selling Lady Gaga's album for 99 cents for one day only. I like Gaga as an artist and I especially like a lot of her earlier songs but I would not have ever pictured myself ordering her album. Though I do not buy a lot of albums I always like having the physical disc especially since I have a car now. I still did not consider it until I spoke with my older sister and knowing that I could not resist a good bargain it was a 'why the hell not' situation.I have to say that there are a lot of singles in this album that I enjoyed. Since a lot of reviewers have already individually critiqued each song I'm just going to scan most and speak of which ones I enjoyed the most. The first track was Americano. I loved it right away. I've always loved Latin/Spanish music though mostly in the Afro-Cuban or salsa genre but this song was fun and reminiscent of some of the authentic Spanish style music. When I listen to this song I could picture a Flamenco or Paso Doble performance to this song. It's a really fun song.I also like Marry the Night. The ending is the best part for me.The only ones that I could say that I am not hot over at the moment are highway unicorn and Schei&szlig;e. Hair is a song I could get used to and although I did NOT like Edge of Glory it has definitely grown on me considering it's constant airplay on the radio.You and I is a pretty good song as well and an excellent track to end the cd to. I could see her doing a mellow video to this at least for her fans that is reminiscent of her journey in music before she became Lady Gaga. I could see her singing this in a bar somewhere.Overall I think this was a solid album. There are not a lot of songs that I would skip at all and I think regardless of those who want to not like her or whatever this album will be plenty for those who are her target audience and for those of whom will appreciate her. I'm honestly just glad I got it for a great price. Can't beat that :)I also want to say that Amazon did a great job on this promotion. I don't know the specifics on how they in fact got it done but they allowed a lot of people to buy this album that otherwise may not have (like myself) and it was great strategy on their part. It also opened people up to the cloud which I was not familiar on and will still need to learn on how to use.Favs: Americano Marry the Night Bloody MarySongs I could do without: Schei&szlig;e Highway Unicorn
"I can somewhat understand the Madonna comparisons to a certain extent. But it is way too early yet to really come to that conclusion. Madonna was a innovator and I personally haven't heard any innovation here. Madonna rarely uses the same beat on every song or same song structure. When I listen to this album I am hearing the same beat repeatedly. Lady Gaga relies hardcore on that steady techno beat which gets boring after awhile. Even Madonna's 2005 effort ""Confessions on the Dance floor"" didn't do this. Madonna is a very versatile artist which Lady Gaga has yet to display this on any album. Madonna has done everything from TransTechnoTrip-hophip-hop and even some R&B; aspects. To be honest Britney Spears has proven to be a more versatile innovative artist than this. And a lot of her work would remind me more of Madonna than Lady GaGa's. ""Born this Way"" is a blatant rip off of ""Express yourself"" which Britney would have never done that. ""Bloody Mary-Heavy Metal Lover"" and ""Electric Chapel"" to me are the only songs on this record that I feel is up to the standard of Madonna. There original and have a unique sound too them and  written very well.  They even sounds like something that Madonna would have written without copying. ""Judas and Government hooker"" to me were the only other standouts on this album. Which they weren't clearly as good as Bloody and Electric. Heavy Metal lover is a good electroclash song but once again sounds out of place. She needs to find more atmosphere in her albums. It seems like she is trying to please everyone. Its hard to get into it when every song is so different and doesn't blend. And all the other songs it just seems like shes trying to hard. Madonna never screams or tries hard her voice is soothing.She could have done more songs like Electric Chapel Bloody Mary and Heavy Metal lover. Probably could have had a stellar record.Commercial music is really at a horrible state right now. Especially with all the heavy weights on hiatus right now. But I honestly think that she just isn't versatile enough to be compared to the heavy weights just yet. She is mostly catering to gay nightclubs which isn't a bad thing. But the music isn't ambient or dark enough to be compared to Madonna. And nor is it creative enough to be compared to any of the heavy weights in the past. I would love to hear her branch out more and try new things. I even think Ke$ha has shown more creativity and only has one album so far. She also wrote ""Til the world ends"" for Britney Spears which i feel is better than anything on here. Ke$ha mixes things up and doesn't use the same formula on every song. Lady Gaga is trying to create a darker sound and its just not working. Its almost like she is trying to mix ElectroClash with Techno which is two entirely different sounds. For one.. the styles are different as night and day one is darker and the other one is a happier style. I am giving this 3 stars because she is better then most conventional artist out there today. And at least she is trying to be different. But in all honesty I don't think Madonna would have chosen any of these tracks. She is way far beyond this style of music. If you go back to her work with William Orbit. It was far more innovative than this and that was over 10 years ago. Not to mention her work with Mirwais Ahmadza it was amazing! And this was many many years back so Gaga has some catching up too do. Listen to Evil by LADYTRON and that was in 2004. So basically what I am saying once again she has a lot of catching up too do. Also if you have time check out there new song LADYTRON-Little Black Angel. Ladytron and Miss Kitten are Miles ahead of Lady GaGa from a production and song structure standpoint. Probably some of the most advanced ahead of their time groups out there. Ladytron's new album ""Gravity the Seducer"" will soon be out and its more ambient according too them.Some good People to check outLadytron  (ElectroClash)IAMX (ElectroClash)Miss Kitten (ElectroClash)Armin Van Buuren  (Ambient Trans)Fisherspooner  (ElectroClash)Jen Lasher  (Electro)Peaches  (ElectroClash)Madonna (ALL)  HeavyweightBritney Spears -  Heavyweight -Blackout Circus and Femme FataleTimbaland  HeavyweightJUSTIN TIMBERLAKE  HeavyweightKelisKe$ha..Amanda Blank  (ElectroClash) and Hip HOPLate night alumni  -  Ambient chill outKleerupMetricStrip mall architecture-  Feather songs and Factory girls"
wow this album rocks!! her best album yet! and i think its the best Album this year with Adele and Britney's album! i love every track on this album.. and i can see any song as a single! just a Masterpiece! and im sure its going to be the Grammy Winner next year!
"I received Gaga's new album Saturday afternoon and played it all weekend. After hearing it a few times and not writing a review in the heat of the moment I can say it is a great album; of course like any album there are throwaway songs and others that stand out. The point here is that I can recommend this album; especially if you purchase it for $0.99.After reading so many negative reviews of customers I suspect did not purchase the album I felt compelled to write my own review. Reviews are not written to attack a person's character they are meant to help other customers when deciding to purchase something. A lot of the 1-star reviews are either about Amazon's servers crashing and not being able to provide the entire album or simply people who absolutely despise Lady Gaga. If you hate an artist so much why write about them on a personal level? Focus on the music.Born This Way has been hyped for such a long time. The title track was a major hit but of course the comparisons with Madonna only got worse. Sadly there is plenty of pop music that uses chord progression and beats. Listen to Strong Enough by Cher it sounds like a total disco song rip-off but it's Cher why would anyone attack her? Anyways the reality is that this album is not her deepest that was The Fame Monster at least for me. With BTW you get a mix of Euro pop 80s stadium music and dare I say some metal influence.I won't break it down track-by-track because my personal opinion on each track differs from everyone else. I will say that there are standout tracks such as: Marry the Night Government Hooker Americano Scheibe Bloody Mary Heavy Metal Lover Electric Chapel (the beautiful) You & I and finally The Edge of Glory. The three bonus tracks on the first disc serve as fillers to take a break from the sledgehammering electronic/metal/pop beats of the entire album. Surprisingly the promo tracks and singles are actually not the best songs on the album with the exception of The Edge of Glory and BTW--I give it the recognition it deserves because of its positive message.Lyrically this album borders absurdity but this is Lady Gaga we're talking about! She has songs about social justice gay marriage Mary Magdalene equality fashion and being strong for her fans. What we're forgetting is that she has never claimed to be anything other than a pop artist. Question: What other mainstream pop artist on the chart right now writes their own music sings live and has songs that are not just about sex in the air getting laid or stuff like that? No one.Shall we discuss Gaga's first three singles? BTW: gay anthem and an empowering song that uses the words ""gay straight or bi lesbian transgender"". I'm surprised mainstream radio even played it. Secondly Judas religious overtones about holding on to the bad in your life when the reality is that you should leave those vices behind in her case the bad guy. Thirdly The Edge of Glory one of the best songs on the album. She said it was about her grandfather's death and being on the edge of glory/death/life. There's a saxophone solo--yes in a mainstream pop song and a very good one.Let's rejoice and be glad that mainstream pop music can possibly change directions because of Lady Gaga's new album. I'm tired of hearing the same auto-tuned factory churned BS that other pop artists are coming out with. I'll name names: Rihanna Katy Perry Kesha and Britney Spears. Yes Gaga's The Fame's first single was about having a good time and dancing but she's matured while these other artists are still stuck on things like S&M; drinking booze and always being secondary to some guy--I'm talking to you Rihanna Kesha and Katy Perry. Luckily we have women like Gaga Pink even Robyn (underrated gem) to save pop music from the industry."
I love Gaga I really do. Her breakthrough album was great pop music and the Fame Monster tracks featured one of the best pop tracks of all time: Bad Romance.Having said that this album falls a bit short. It's worth a listen there are glimmers of Gaga definitely maturing as an artist and experimenting. In fact one or two albums from now will probably be out-of-sight.High points: Some interesting vocal choices some cool instrument arrangements occasional flashes of lyrical brilliance.Low points: The other 90% of the lyrics and the fact some of it was clearly recorded on a Casio keyboard from 1984.Looking forward to future attempts!
This is really probably the best album I've heard. I've only lived 18 years but nothing has been as amazing to me as this album. I can't even choose a favorite song it's so good! :) Everyone should hear this and give it a real chance. She has some real talent.
As a fan of Fame & Fame Monster I went into this thinking there Lady Gaga was back to offer more...sadly she missed the mark in my opinion. Wasn't a fan of Born This Way somewhat interested in Judas but outside of those two songs this album was terrible. I had high hopes that she could live up to the same quality from Fame/Fame Monster but in my opinion she didn't. I feel as if I should ask for my .99 back after listening to this.
"If you come into Born This Way and expect to hear the exact same type of dance-pop that laced The Fame and to a lesser extent The Fame Monster you will likely be a bit disappointed with this album. It isn't bubblegum.Have you ever looked up videos of a young Gaga on YouTube? Have you watched stripped down performances of her dance-pop singles? If you have then you should realize that at her heart Lady Gaga is a rocker chick who has an instinctive ability to break these songs down to a pop enough core that they connect with a broader audience. However in Born This Way Gaga didn't feel the need to break the songs down as far as she did previously.I think this is smart as it keeps her about 30 paces ahead of the Gaga mimickers who have sprung up during the past two years and the established stars who have transitioned to trying to claim a piece of her thunder (Katy Perry I love your music too but your public persona has become more and more Gaga in the past 18 months.)Gaga really shows off her voice in Born This Way - in a much more clear and resonant manner than she was able to with The Fame. ""Marry the Night"" ""Electric Chapel"" ""Edge of Glory"" and ""You and I"" are show pieces from this perspective. Electric Chapel and Marry the Night are superb fun to listen to.In reference to comments in a prior review about ""Judas"" and ""Bloody Mary."" The in-your-face parallels in songs like Judas and Bloody Mary are poetic in their power while not getting too broken down in the details of a bad relationship. Judas without the name of Judas as the song would become another cliche about loving someone who always betrays that love. By using the name Judas it is given from the start that this is betrayal at its most extreme and the song can operate more freely within its dance beat without having to explain this fact throughout 2 verses and an extended bridge cycle. I personally don't really understand people who freak out about her writing a song with the name Judas as the title. It was probably chosen simply because Benedict Arnold didn't fit the rhythm as well.Sorry for the ranting but really read some poetry and come back to the imagery in Lady Gaga's songs and let us know if it's still complicated. I'm thinking it will not be.I think if you are looking for a different but well-crafted Gaga sound you will find it in Born This Way. The sounds are powerful the lyrics cleverly crafted and the voice stunning. (Stunning because Gaga lets her songs lead her voice instead of constantly having to show off how well she sings.) If you want pure pop you will not find it here.ETA: The bonus tracks definitely add a spark to the CD. I like the dance-esque remixes for work-outs. If you can grab Born This Way for a cheap price the first week of release do that and then download the special edition tracks separately. After the sale prices end just splurge on the Special Edition."
"""Judas"" is not Lady Gaga's best song.However I loved Sarah Rooney's priceless parody ""Lady Gaga's `Judas' is EVIL"" on Youtube.I'm fascinated by the fact that 120000 people don't understand that Sarah is just joking!Both Christians and atheists go crazy over her clip. Rooney (whoever she might be) has exposed the stupidity of both religious fundamentalism and cyber-atheism not to mention the generally low level of Youtube discourse...How can anyone seriously think that a real Christian would say ""Judas is another name for Jesus""?As for Lady Gaga I know for a fact that she isn't Illuminati. I know because I AM Ashtar Command.LOL."
I would have liked to have known what made this version a 'Special Edition' before I purchased this product.  It is in fact a double cd.  It is great. If you like Lady Gaga you will love this cd.  I think it is worth paying a little extra for the Special Edition.
I am on my second listen of this album and am blown away by Lady Gaga's range and influence. $.99 for a brand new album including a PDF booklet is an amazing deal especially since I was going to go out and buy the album anyway. Plus if I had been disappointed it wouldn't have been the worst dollar I'd ever spent.Gaga is a creative genius and even if she is a little weird everyone knows her name because of it. Be who you are and love yourself cuz baby you were born this way!
Can't beat it for under a buck.  It downloaded immediately onto my cloud drive and onto my andriod app - so I'm apparently not having the problems anyone is having.
I like the CD for what it is. She comes across an extremely talented Madonna clone. If she didn't try so hard to be over the top and copy or out-bizarre Madonna I might enjoy it more than I do.On to the purchasing snafu some people are having. I purchased the Born This Way [+digital booklet] version three times for three different people using three different computers; a pc a Mac and a netbook. All purchased and downloaded with zero problems. I use the Amazon Cloud Drive and the Amazon MP3 downloader. And the fine print of it all is that Amazon does RECOMMEND people use them to purchase stage store and download your music purchases. Quite a few people have opted for neither and solely came to Amazon for the .99 album.These people will eventually get all of their purchase. But they are unfortunately on a low priority service tier. Cloud users with Amazon MP3 are top tier. Amazon MP3 is second tier. The bottom line is that some people opted to not use those services; so their music was not instantly transferred and/or downloaded. They will get it today; it just won't be for a while. Be patient and keep checking your download queue. And ALWAYS please please please read the fine print.
"I've been riding the Gaga bandwagon since the Fame. Most artists put a LOT into their first release and then have ""letdowns"". Gaga's Monster was I thought actually better then The Fame simply because she stretched a little....I love this CD for the same reason. Gaga is a very talented young lady. Her vocals for me WON me over the Music. I think she is Amazing and I do think she can ""Rock Out"".I can't wait to hear the next release! My only concern is that she Peaks too soon but from the sounds on this CD the girl has Great Possibilities. My Fave cut off this CD? Edge of Glory. The Judas tune is GOOD a little weird and very Retro....Gaga is not ""mindless"" there is a purpose behind her music which I think makes her Special among today's artists....I got the Amazon special but I'll happily buy the special edition also just because I enjoy listening to this lady perform.....I do think she is Visual....a true performance artist but there doesn't seem to be a limit to what she can do....I hope she never reaches it.BTW....I did buy the Special Edition....GREAT purchase! I think a GREAT aspect of Gaga is her VOICE....there are some so-so songs on the CD like Americano...butshe has such a FINE voice....it trancends the song itself.....Electric Chapel...and Judas are GREAT tunes....To answer some later would be critics...YES....there is a lot of Electronic SOUNDS here....the Music SURROUNDS you. For me Music is about Sounds....I like Everything...I LOVE this CD....Play it....replay it....let it Engulf you....Enjoy Gaga....there are a lot of wannabes....but the Lady isAMAZING!Atreides"
I highly recommend this CD/DVD combo pack.  Not only do you get all the great music of the Born this Way CD but you also get the best show ever...the Monster Ball Tour - If you weren't a Lady Gaga fan before this will definitely turn you into one.
Born this way is her best album yet with amazing hit singles like: Born this way Judas Edge of Glory You and I and Marry the night. Every song in the album is unique with a different feel. Her songs pack so much emotion and feeling. This album is legendary and will surely go down in the record books as one of the best albums of all time.
"I am going to have to agree with Lady Gaga...Born This Way IS the album of the decade.  Its the best POP album of the decade (kylie minogues Aphrodite is a close second) and maybe even the best pop album of the last 20 years.  This is true pop music with a dance/trance flair.  It is however not bubblegum pop in anyway at all.  Born This Way is very dark and somewhat scary too.  I cant really see these songs on American radio though.  Not even the title track even though it was a monster (no pun intended) hit and is played constantly on the radio.  Born This Way is europop....in the same vein as Kylie Minogue a little except nowhere near as happy and bubblegummy as Kylie.  The music on Born This Way does not sound like anything americans would like to me.  I dont think it is going to appeal to the masses like her last two releases did.  It is not going to have mass commercial appeal as evidenced by the lack of her other singles not catching on. It is going to have a limited appeal...her little monsters. In fact this album will call out alot of her ""little monsters"" as little fakes.  If her little monsters dont like this album then they arent little monsters and they never were and never will be.  I consider it an honor to be one of her fans....one of her ""little monsters.  Hair is a blast and will never leave you head once you hear it and You and I is a cool ballad similiar to bon jovi i think and its also similiar to one of Chers bombastic ballads she might record.  Electric Chapel is straight up Madonna from her confessions period and Bloody Mary reminds me of the pet shop boys.  Also there is the kylie influence too.  Edge of Glory is pop masterpiece and Shceibe is downright weird but catchy.  Also who cares if madonna has done it before.  So what!!!  Madonna doesnt own pop music or the ability to shock people.  Now its Lady Gagas time to shine and shine she does on this cd.  I cant get over how much i've been enjoying listening to it.  I guess i'm officially a ""little monster"" now."
"All of the albums I've bought over the past few years have left me disappointed to varying degrees so BORN THIS WAY had a lot to make up for. Plus my yard stick for judging this is The Fame Monster so in all honesty I had been preparing myself for disappointment.Lets begin by talking vocals; who knew she had that kind of vocal ability? I've seen her live supporting The Pussycat Dolls [in my defence I did only go to see Lady GaGa] and in her Monster Ball tour and whilst I thought she had a good pair of lungs on her I didn't think that there was anything special about her.But seriously the change of musical styles has shown that whilst she can't reach the higher octaves like Mariah Carey or Christina Aguilera but she has otherwise as powerful lungs as them. She can hold and/or draw out her notes just as ably as either of them.Several album tracks do have a strong religious overtone but I don't find them remotely preachy or blasphemous. She's voicing her personal opinions and musings how can her personal thoughts be so easily judged right or wrong? Sorry to stand on a soapbox but it annoys me when a few people go all judge and jury on others - are they really so perfect themselves?A quick roundup; we've got a progression in both lyrics and vocals plus she's wrote every song and co-produced everything. Can't argue with credentials like that plus I love the heavy slightly retro synths and general rockier sound.But whilst I am loving BORN THIS WAY and think that is far superior to The Fame I'm also aware that [in my view] every single track on The Fame Monster was single worthy something that this hasn't quite achieved. There's nothing here that I'd dub as a filler but if I heard that one track [Marry The Night] was receiving a single release I'd be ""meh"".But when that's the only criticism available I know that I'm onto a winner.Oh - just wanted to add that I'm not sure how much you'll enjoy BORN THIS WAY if you love The Fame [the original one disc version] as this album is so different in sound and message. Personally I thought The Fame was good but not anything particularly special and aside from it's singles I rarely listen to it anymore. BORN THIS WAY is not really made for the more casual fan. It's not like The Fame where you can just listen and bop along to catchy tunes it's an album where you have to pay attention to the lyrics and the messages within them."
This album sounds like it was put together by a Lady Gaga wannabe... I am giving this album 2 stars since I paid only 99 cents for it but not sure if I am going to play it again in the gym it is too bland even for my treadmill running. LG you can do much better than this album we know this for sure! Please try again.
Usually it's very very rare for me to like every single song on an artists album; it seems there are several good hits and the rest are just meh..not worth listening to.  This isn't the case for Lady Gaga and her new album Born this Way. I can listen to every single track on the CD over and over again. She really cares about her fans and puts effort into every single thing she creates. She's great buy this album!
"So glad I wasted $1 on the gaga album and got NOTHING! NEVER buy an MP3 from AMAZON as there is no one who cares if you get what you pay for! No one offering money back to all of us who paid for an item we never received. Pushing the excuse that it was too much and just ""crashed"" their servers... ummmm that isn't our problem but I bet they're going to take our stolen money to upgrade those servers!!!"
This album is amazing. Every song is so catchy and brilliantly produced. And you can tell how much stronger her voice has gotten from all the touring on this album. A definite must-buy! Exceptional.
"I love Lady Gaga as a figure - she's always been highly inspirational and motivational however this review is directed towards her music - which in this case has sadly been a disappointment. I loved almost all of the tracks on The Fame and The Fame Monster but this album has largely been a disappointment. I knew that she could never live up to the bar that she set with her first two albums but a drop of this caliber is astounding.The ""eargasmic"" beats that made me want to dance have almost completely disappeared in this entire new album. I would have to go out on a limb and say that NONE of the tracks on this album are of the caliber of even the lowest of songs on her previous album with the exception of maybe ""You and I"".Track by Track Review:1) Marry the Night (2.5/5) - It's got a good beat I must admit. However the lyrics - they're atrocious. It's hard to understand what she's even singing about half of this song.2) Born This Way (3/5) - This song has a bit more depth to it however there are numerous covers of it that are sung better than her original. The beat as in Marry the Night is decent.3) Government Hooker (0/5) - Quite possibly the WORST track on this album and a contender for the worst track in all of pop music. It's a complete mess. It sounds like something procured by some cheap DJ in some awful club in downtown Tijuana and her singing is rather atrocious too. The lyrics have no depth either. It sounds like the musical equivalent of someone's drunken vomit.4) Judas (1.5/5) - An example of the many cases when the meaning she tries to convey is completely overwhelming. The fact that she named this song 'Judas' to begin with is astonishing. The beat is alright in this one. But the lyrics and their intended meaning cannot be taken seriously by any listener.5) Americano (2/5) - Sounds like some twisted mix of the Polka / Electronic / Latin Music. The beat does not work well and the lyrics are weak as well. Better than the previous two tracks however.6) Hair (2.5/5)7) Scheibe (2/5)8) Bloody Mary (2.5/5) - Another example of one of her overblown religious songs that is difficult to take seriously due to the magnitude of the comparison.9) Bad Kids (2/5)10) Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) (2.5/5)11) Heavy Metal Lover (1.5/5) - Sounds like something taken from Kesha and Gaga put her name to it.12) Electric Chapel (3/5)13) You and I (4.5/5) - The only track on this entire album that would deserve to be included on ""The Fame"" or ""The Fame Monster"".14) The Edge of Glory (3.5/5)Overall this has been a disappointment from Gaga. It's sad to see that she is already declining after her first two albums. The tunes and beats are worse than her first two and the lyrics' meaning are not as easy to connect to for a general audience. The fame she has received has clearly gone to her head. Her fame is all the image and the music is deteriorating quickly.(This will be updated again later in the day once I've had a good night's sleep and found more words to express my disappointment.)"
First of all yes this may not be Lady Gaga's best music. Part of that is because she released good singles. Born This Way (the song) is amazing. Bloody Mary is one of my new favorites. Judas Hair and The Edge of Glory are all pretty good as well. But guys...this was 99 CENTS yesterday! I'm sorry but I will now look to AMAZON not iTunes to buy music. That price is simply ridiculous. But now I'm a happy camper!!
Love it!! Can't beat it for $.99 on the day it's released!!! Downloaded album with NO problems!!
Look - I'm no Lady Gaga fanatic.  I have neither of her 2 earlier albums (or extensions) just a few CDs here and there.However this... this is an epic CD.Channeling and sampling music from earlier artists- in short borrowing from Hip Hop- adding empowerment great *singing* ... this is a milestone in 21st century pop music.Highlights:- Hair: maybe it's because I have so little but i love it!- Americano:  excellent!- Fashion of His Love: Channel Whitney Houston baby...- You and I- Marry the NightBring it On.I am one of the converted.
"People shouldn't use this to complain that the downloads were slow. Obviously they were going to be slow thousands of people were on at the same time trying to get it. Everyone should have their Downloads now mine downloaded right away last night with no problem. Amazon is great they always have deals on MP3's and CD's!As for the album I was originally only going to download ""You and I"" because dance music isn't really my thing but I couldn't pass up the great deal of 99 cents for the first day only for the whole album. Even though I'm not a big dance music fan I like Lady GaGa's personality and respect how she writes her own music actually sings live and can even play the piano well. The songs are catchy and fun and it's not all about dance beats there is a lot on this album. Some good guitar work especially on ""You and I"" by Brian May from Queen. Lady Gaga should do an album like Elton John some great piano/rock songs! I like this album Fans will definitely love it."
"Two paws WAY up!  I was afraid that I wouldn't really love Lady Gaga's new album since I didn't really like the ""Judas"" single but I was pleasantly surprised.  Get ready to get out of your chair shake your butt and sing along! My favs: Born This Way Hair Scheisse Heavy Metal Lover.I hope that the people who gave poor reviews based on technical issues will re-evaluate since the low rating simply reflects poorly on the album not amazon."
"""Marry the Night"" is on her ""Born this Way"" album.  I needed to buy it immediatley.  Love the hook when she declares repeatedly ""...gonna gonna gonna marry gonna gonna gonna marry gonna gonna gonna marry the night......OOuhhhhhgonna marry gonna gonna gonna marry gonna gonna gonna marry the night."""
"More than a few people have been saying this CD is completely different from any of her other's with the exception of ""Born this Way"" ""Judas"" and ""Edge of Glory."" And yes this may be true but I don't happen to think of that negatively. I very much enjoyed this CD even the first time I listened to each track. I happen to adore Bloody Mary and Hair. I think that this just proves that the same old same old term will never apply to Lady Gaga. And seriously guys...judas? Really? Get over it lol. It's a great song."
This is the best album in the history of the universe!!!! This new one is Lady Gaga's best yet and its so empowering to everyone who's not like the average person. I think the best part is that you can listen to it so many times and you won't get bored. My favorite songs are Edge of Glory Fashion of His Love Amen Fashion and You and I. This is such a feel-good album and perfect for dancing when nobody's watching. If you want to do something good for yourself you should go out and buy this album.
...now i truly can't deny how great this album is. All tracks are killers and each track is lusciously multi layered in such fine arrangements. Gaga is a true music genius. Props to her for making pop music interesting again beyond my wildest imagination. Hard to ignore because it is THAT good!
"I only wanted to download ""Judas"" but when I found out that the entire album's $0.99 why not?  I ought to be thankful and I truly am.  For that I will just point out one very eggregious issue I have with this piece of work out of maybe three or four.""Americano"" is sooooooooooo bad (as in AWFUL) that I have to delete it from my computer!  The first couple of lines is a rip off of the song ""Mambo Italiano"".Other than ""Judas"" the song I really love in this album is ""Electric Chapel"".  The rest are just OK...kind of the songs you just hear in the background.I haven't heard ""You and I"" because the download failed...anyway if it's really good I don't mind spending $0.99 to buy that track."
Gaga really astounded me with this album! The publicity over its release was HUGE and the outcome was even better! Easily the top selling album of the year! its already winning awards around the world! Gaga really knows how to make her fans happy! I heard Marry The Night will be her next single coming out closer to the end of the year whihc is UBER exciting!!! Can't wait for the Born This Way Ball Tour ! Follow me on twitter @bengoldey
I love this item. It looks great and is very professionally done. I bought this because I wanted The Madison Square Gardens live performance and the Born This Way album so it turned out a win-win situation with the price. The live performance was taped and edited very well. I especially liked the So Happy I Could Die performance. The madison Square Gardens is one cd and in it's little paper case it includes a photo gallery as well as the songs she sings in order. Other than the live singing the cd also includes backstage footage which was fun to watch and Born This Way acappella. The Born This Way album also includes The Remix compilation as well as the lyrics to all the songs.I read in a different review here that the little cardboard box the 3 cds are kept in is bad quality. If you have The Fame Monster limited edition usb stick with that flimsy box you'll see this is a huge improvement.If you are a Lady Gaga fan this is a must have item. Buy it now or be sorry later.
This has to be her best album of the year all the songs are fresh and unique. Everybody buy this album if you love Gaga or good pop music.
"For one dollar getting the new pop ""album"" is a fun buy.  I don't get what all the bad reviews are for towards Amazon.  If its just a dollar wait for it.  God these kids don't remember the days of kazaa or napster where you waited all day for albums.I got mine when I got off of work and it took about 5 minutes total.  Five minutes and a dollar for something that really not that good and I didn't need to deal with annoying Best buy staff.  I buy lots from amazons digital download service and it works great all the time.  Yesterday was a hiccup but even then it worked fine.Think people (kids) millions of people were hitting this site for this one deal.  No site can handle that stress. But hey the album is OK...  She just seems pretty aimless with this and is having fun experimenting with things.  Which is cool for a dollar.  But I wont be buying the special edition CD anytime soon.  Maybe I'll warm up tot it some more after a few plays.Thanks Amazon Awesome deal!"
Lady GaGa is one of the best musican/ singer out there and boy can she write songs about boyfriends and or religous things.
It's Lady Gaga - what more do you need to say! Many many great tracks including one of my favorite theme songs &#34;Born This Way.&#34;
"I am absolutely hypnotized by this new Album of Lady Gaga! I can't stop listening to it and the songs are pure magic! Lady Gaga is the biggest superstar of our time she is the ""Madonna"" of our time!!! Never ever have I seen an artist being that amazing like she is. Not only is her music superb hynotizing captivating.... I could fill this with so much more words.... she is also a fashion icon of her own! Highly recommand this Album! This will be a classic forever!"
I purchased and paid for this album only to have it download 4 songs. Amazon says its a known issue and an email would be sent its been going on for HOURS and nothing! I am so disappointed. I'm sure the album is Great so I hope that if you are reading this it is not reflected on the album only the amazon customer service and handling of this album!
its very hard for me to describe in words how good this album is to me of course. this has been an album that i listen to as part of my daily routine. it's not just music though if you listen to the messages that come from the songs it makes you feel better. it helps embrace yourself no matter who you are where you come from how much money you got in your pocket because you were born this way.
I am not that big of a GaGa fan but for the low price of 99 cents that it is being offered at I figured why not.  I have been pleasantly surprised.  It is a solid album.  The reason I went four as opposed to five stars is that it really kind of feels like this album was made already by Madonna a long time ago.  It seems like she is trying to channel that into something of her own.  But to me it all sounds kind of similar. In summation well worth the purchase.P.S.  Cloud ComplaintsIt seems that all should be worked out.  Amazon customer service said that they are working on it as I type. Prior to this I have never had any issues with the cloud.  Also what's great about this is you have access to 20 GB of cloud storage when you purchase an album and this covers it.
I honestly tried to like this album but I just don't.  I have nothing against Lady Gaga but her music does not appeal to me.  But I am only out $0.99 so no major loss.
"What can I say that has not been said already. This is a phenomenal album for a phenomenal price. The slow download is to be expected when 100000000 people have probably ordered it @ $0.99 (do the math) This was a stress test for Amazon's cloud MP3 service.Did it go perfectly? No.Will Amazon make it right? Yes.Is this a fabulous deal? YesAmazon as well as other cloud providers.. (Google Microsoft et al are you paying attention?) will learn from this and be able to provide even better service in the future. Don't give ""Born This Way"" a bad rating because your songs took a long time to download. Rate the content not the delivery."
"Don't pay too much attention to those complaining about not being able to access all the tracks.  This has happened to me to but who cares-- it's just a glitch; I'm sure Amazon will take care of it soon.  I can only access one track at the moment but it's a great track ""Hair"" and I'm looking forward to  listening to the rest soon.  Meanwhile what could be better than getting the latest release from Lady Gaga for less than a buck!!!!"
$1 is a hell of a deal for any album but honestly how can people say to rate the album and not Amazon? Where else should we voice our dissatisfaction for only 1/2 a download? Servers can't handle the requests? Honestly? From the company that rents out server space to other companies that handles millions of requests on a daily basis and on major shopping days like black friday? Maybe it's to promote the cloud service because when downloading to your computer it doesn't say you're added to a queue and download will resume when it can. It says that the download has expired and that you have to contact customer service to try and get what you paid for. iTunes may not have deals like this but they have reliable service. If Amazon is saying they can't handle the volume I guess I'll stick with someone who can.
.The music was great but the cd case was broken--didn't damage the cd but it is difficult to open and close the case.
This disjointed piece of trash is an album? Look LG you have a cheap Madonna sound. Just admit you are trying to rip her off and she actually inspired you.FYI for people crying about the cloud player you need to drill down and download the album not the single.
You know real artists don't have to be ridiculous.No idea what the purpose of this album was. No message no story just bunch of forgetable garbage.
I really wasn't feeling the singles and videos but listening to them album is a different story all together.  BTW is an utterly joyous experience sort of reminds me of late 80s/early 90s Madonna only more vocally versatile and aggressive.  Sonically BTW has touches of industrial music a little Joy Division and a continuation of the European techno sound that she is famous for.  The album should be listened to in its entirety in order to be fully appreciated; it is more of an 'album' rather than 'singles' album where only a few songs are good and the rest are so-so at best or do not fit in with the overall theme of the album.  Definitely not a sophomore slump that's if you do not count The Fame Monster as real album because it was an EP from The Fame.
"""Born This Way"" is an amazing album that combines traditional pop and dance music with jazz and light rock to create an interesting variety of songs.  Little Monsters will fall deeper in love with Mother Monster and skeptics will be won over by her musical acumen.  Even in the most ""pop"" style of song Lady Gaga somehow provides an innovative element- whether it's her lyrics a bridge or a chorus. Though many of her songs are ""pop"" or ""dance"" in genre they are vastly different from other manufactured pop songs.  My personal favorite track is ""Edge of Glory"" combines traditional pop with light rock and jazz for an interesting and exciting combination.  On every track Lady Gaga's personality and emotions come through and you understand this album was a personal special process to her.  Although some of Lady Gaga's lyrics may be perceived as controversial the overall message the album sends is positive.  As she alludes to in ""Hair"" and ""Born this Way""(song) Lady Gaga encourages her fans to stay true to who they are have pride in their abilities and foster love understanding and acceptance in their communities.  With this type of a message musical talent and generally fun songs this is a great testament to Lady Gaga's abilities as an artist and musical icon."
I had to listen to the album about 5 times before I decided I liked it. It wasn't an immediate love like I had for The Fame or The Fame Monster. It's not terrible and there are a few real good songs on here but she can do MUCH better. Her lyrics were unbearably corny at times and the sound was all over the place. She tried to branch out too much and she lost herself in the process. Plus there really aren't that many songs on here that were single material and I don't know how she didn't realize that. I saw Gaga live and it was amazing. She's smart and she's really talented and hard-working. I hope she gets her stuff together and fast.
"I absolutely love ""The Fame"" and ""The Fame Monster"" and I think one of the reasons why is because those are two of the best sounding CDs I have heard.  Some of us actually have decent stereos that need a well recorded CD to really shine.  However ""Born This Way"" is an absolutely terrible sounding CD.  It is compressed and is unlistenable.  I guess it is for those with poor hearing and cheap MP3 players."
cant believe how hard she fell with the other music so original [snicker] but she's lost so much energy to me she is the first of her kind in every way the shock value  of her act no one has done that before and she does so well that I don't feel too intimidated by it its just like having a glass of water with bread to dip it in its what makes us fans like her
I chose this rating because it came fast & it was in very good condition. it plays well to. Its also a good cd
I don't normally review CDs but I am already in love with this album.  I can actually listen to every song and realize that it is Lady Gaga without listening to monotone tracks and pre-recorded voices.  My musical interests range from Queen to Mew to Skrillex and Adele.  Gaga just kills this album from start to finish.  Some of the best tracks on the album have not been released but Edge of Glory and Born this Way are still favs because of the message.
This album seems more mature and has more of an edge than her previous albums.  If you are expecting more of the same from Gaga you will be disappointed.  I have to admit that I was a little thrown off by this album at first but after listening to it several times it has really grown on me and now I absolutely love it.  Hardcore Gaga fans will love this album. Casual fans will probably hate it.  Just be sure you know which category you fall in before you buy.
I woke up at 6:30 this morning and did the same thing I always do grabbed my Android powered HTC EVO and downloaded my Free App of the Day from the amazon Android Market then used the amazon mp3 app to get the free song of the day and there it was... $.99 for the Born This Way Album! A-mazing hit the button to buy a few minutes later turned on my computer went to amazon launched my cloud player the whole album was there sent it to windows media player then synced with my mp3 player listened to Lady Ga Ga all day! No problems at all. And oh the album is everything I expected it to be A-mazing!
this cd is simply amazing and so gosh darn creative i just cant stand it. i haven't been able to stop listening to it since i got it. bloody mary and marry the night are two of my favorites. and you and i is a work of genius. the whole cd fills me with emotion and makes me wanna get up on my feet and move its truly inspiring. All the beats and lyrics combined with Lady GaGa fantastically chilling voice makes this cd awesome and unique.
This album sounds great - the songs are super up-beat and it's more of a dance album than her previous one. I really like how she has Clarence from the E-Street band on the album - adds a neat Bruce Springsteen vibe to it.
"As a huge Lady Gaga fan I was expecting the new album to include songs with a more pop/dance-like feel. I was slightly disappointed when the new album contained songs very similar to Madonna and not anything like the previous. I think all of her songs now include some hidden ""message"" and it doesn't have that same feel-good vibe. There are a few songs that are worth hearing but other than that the only good thing about this was the 99 cent deal from Amazon."
Love Lady Gaga her style and music are unique and empowering my 5 year old is a big fan she spands generations of people as well that enjoy her music.
This is my first time buying music from Amazon and it will be my last I will gladly pop back to iTunes and pay the album price there.I haven't figured out why 5 songs failed to download and trying to transfer the songs to iTunes isn't worth my continued hassle.Amazon stick to books and leave the music downloads to the professionals.
"Beyotch can pen a hook that's all I can say. I listened to it once and wasn't blown away. Five minutes later I was in the bathroom singing ""Americano."" What's up with that? I don't like four on the floor dance music but gave it a .99 cent chance and now I see she does have talent and is quite cleverly tapping into our cultural zeitgeist with baby talk choruses and over the top social commentary using her body as a part of the art. Rock on Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga."
It isn't just pop electronic or dance.  GaGa has transcended these genres throwing in soul rock country trance and euro-underground club sounds.  The album is loud fast furious and refuses to let you go.  The chanting ululations and sonic assault that BORN THIS WAY becomes proves that it is the most ambitious progressive refreshing mainstream pop album (and I use this term loosely) that has been released in my memory.
What an album  there is so much music.  Some of the songs are a bit out there but nothing that you would not expect from Gaga.
"There are a few reviews for the mp3 download Lady Gaga ""Born This Way"" (Special Edition) lambasting Amazon's servers for essentially being 'too slow' to handle the massive download requests for Gaga's new album.  Some of these reviews conflate the idea that because of technological ineptness it is perfectly logical to vote down Gaga's album.  This is not one of those reviews.  On the contrary I found there to be no 'massive' download problems when I downloaded the album Tuesday 25 May in the evening.As for Lady Gaga's new album I was extremely surprised despite my initial dislike/disinterest in her first single ""Born This Way.""  I did not think she could surpass the catchy creative and intelligent songs like ""Alejandro"" ""Bad Romance"" and ""Monster"" that continued to be replayed ad infinitum  on my playlist far after their initial release date.I underestimated her craft to weave a truly expressive creative hypnotic set of songs.  This album clearly illustrates a key step in the evolutionary progress of Gaga-- an icon whose following of loyal fans threatens to dwarf well-accomplished divas as Madonna and Cher divas who are more than twice Gaga's age.  Indeed her new album expands upon an underdeveloped technique that I refer to as a so-called 'song-within-song-within-a-song' property: A good variety of her songs (e.g.: ""Judas"" ""Scheisse"" and ""Electric Chapel"") contain at least two or three different song melodies within the song itself.  This creates sensation of uniqueness and newness that will help to maintain your interest and prevent staleness.There are good number of songs that are just absolutely clever and fun.  ""Scheisse"" creates a clever play on gibberish German that translates to a rather unique and fresh melody.  ""Bloody Mary"" attributes the saying in a completely different and unsuspecting way.There are some that will make you stand still.  ""Hair"" is a haunting plight for equality and the last few moments of ""Marry the Night"" will make your eardrums vibrate and leave your soul resonating for more.There are also some that will carry a veneer that may shock but whose skin otherwise crumbles under further examination: ""Government Hooker"" and ""Judas"" carry with them the typical 'Gaga-esque"" shock factor.""Americano"" is cleverly (and perhaps deliberately) reminiscent of ""Inglorious Basterds.""There will be some who hate Gaga and may say that if you've heard one of her songs you've inevitably heard them all.  Those however who found her first album a delight will undoubtedly find Born This Way irresistible and a veritable masterpiece."
"Being a fan of her first two albums I will admit I expected more fun dancefloor anthems and even a good ballad or two. My fave song of hers is ""Monster"" but with Born This Way she kinda went Anthem Rock/Dance Pop... And I.dont hate it buut I dont like it. What I do like is:Marry The Night: A verry good track dark but beautiful good opener.Born This Way: Of course an anthem for the Gay community but also an anthem for originality and it hits the nail on the head solid!Judas: Im sorry I guess it has a bad connnotation if ur uber religious but if u really listen its about being with the guy you should love but still being in love with the man whos bad for you that toxic man... Everyone has a toxic man. Thank u Gaga for this epic song.Hair: Love it its beautiful I feel the same way with my hair :)Scheisse: one of my new faves this song alone wardants another star.Bloody Mary: OMG I love this track its my favorite I cant even describe it!Electris Chapel: My second favorite I love the ""dut du du dut dut du du"" and ""If u wanna steal my heart away meet me meet me baby in a safe place"" she really does have a way with words.The Edge Of Glory: Epic! That is all.And the bad:Government Hooker: Seriously this song is ridiculously stupid I cannot stand it hate hate hate!Black Jesus + Amen Fashion: im dorry but why?! When she wrote this did she really think thats good? This is like the trashy low-class version of ""Vogue""!Highway Unicorn (Road to Love): She really boggles my mind.This is NOT the album of the decade like she claimed its not even the album of the year but its good it has a few good songs but the number ones shes used to are missing on this album. Other than BTW & Judas... I dont see anymore big hits. She got to confident.... Maybe next tine Gaga."
There's only one thing I might change - move Born This Way later in the track order.  The single has been out for such a long time I'd have preferred something new on track two.Otherwise perfect album at a perfect price!
This must be one of the best gaga albums yet. She always tops herself even when no one thinks that is even possible. This cd always gets me up and moving no matter where I am!! IT'S A MUST HAVE!
I agree with another reviewer on here that this album is not your typical bubblegum pop that you might be used to with her previous albums. When I hear this album I feel like I'm watching or listening to a musical and it's so interesting. I think that Gaga's ability to surprise us with whatever she comes out with is so important especially with music today (pop music) coming out and sounding exactly the same. This album definitely highlights her vocals and the music is stunning. Overall though I feel like many people (or common people) might not get it even those who are already Gaga fans. But that's too bad. It's quite sophisticated.
"Lady GaGa's ""Born This Way"" Album is Incredible! I love every song on this album unlike her past 2 albums which I had some I hated. I would say this is SO FAR the album of the year Hands Down!! Lady GaGa Finally was able to do a album very personal to her and something that is more reminiscent of the sound she wanted in the first 2 albums!! I recommend this album to everyone there is a mixture of everything on here!! My only complaint is not towards her but towards her label or whoever compromises her to have to put out music that bleeps whenever cuss words are said. Why does it matter other artists put out worse stuff than that but its whatever!! Congrats Lady GaGa you have outdone yourself which is not very easy to do!!"
"I am so mad! I purchased this and not only did I not get ALL of the content on the actual disc (which I'll be promptly going to purchase in a brick and mortar store) this is an EDITED VERSION. B**ch is edited out of the song ""The Queen"" and that is only the first I've discovered. Save yourself the hassle of the Amazon Cloud (a pain in the arf) and buy the real thing elsewhere!!!"
"I bought this album several days after the release date itself. The album is fully a dance-club anthem however sporadically infused with a myriad of other genres like Techno Heavy Metal & Rock etc. Each individual track shines on its own way and are all very different. I really enjoy the instrumentals a lot and not forgetting Lady Gaga's phenomenal vocals. The lyrics mark the work of a genius with many perspective and interpretations on the meaning of each song. Personally my few favorite tracks off the album are ""Judas"" ""Bloody Mary"" ""Hair"" & ""Yo&uuml; & I"". However I still love every single track on the album. On the overall this album is fantastic! Everyone should listen to it!"
This was instantly transferred to my Amazon Cloud drive (which I've never used before) and I found out I can access it on my phone as well. I'm going to have to burn this on a CD to use in my car but on the whole 99 cents for an entire album with instant access is an absolute steal - thank you Amazon!
She knows how to get attention but not how to make good music. This album might have been overpriced at 99 cents.
I bought the album at work and installed the Amazon mp3 Downloader.  When I ran it though it never downloaded a single megabit and stayed stuck at 0% for about 15 minutes.  I figured it might be some kind of security thing at my work and that I would just fini.... I mean start the download at home that night.  Little did I know that it wouldn't be available when I got home and they wanted me to pay for it again.  Why Amazon can't just use your browser's downloader like every other website on the planet is beyond me.  Instead they want us to clutter our computer with yet another program that doesn't even seem to work. 0 stars for Amazon on this.  It was only $.99 but it will be worth the inconvenience that it will cause to someone at Amazon so I'm gonna dispute the charges on my Credit Card. F-in ridiculous.  Media people just can't seem to figure out why piracy is so rampant.  Well free or not it's easier than going legit.
There are a lot of Lady Gaga haters.  I'm not a star struck person but I not only like her music but what she stands for.  She stands up for what she believes.  There are actually a lot of great songs on this album and all for .99.. awesome!
Well it's been 12 hours and I only have 2 songs and the digital book. For an artist who cares so much about her fans I wonder if she knows how Amazon is treating them.
However the record sleeves are poor in design and the interior of the album leaves one wanting more. Buy for sound not for a good LP experience.
For 99 cents for the whole album? I'll wait to get it. Except mine downloaded in less than 5 minutes.  So go for it!  Go get the new album for 99 cents and enjoy!  It's a great album too.
After hearing all the hype as to how amazing this CD was going to be I must say I'm a little disappointed. Overall it's good and most tracks are quite catchy. Best word to use is inconsistent when describing this CD; starts out strong then has a few weak tracks in a row followed by pretty good ones until it ends on a very high note. Definitely worth getting and better than 99% of the music out there now yet it still has some clunkers that are way too trippy.
So this is inevitably a great price for the whole album. Just one note to the promotion of free 20GB storage on the cloud drive: apparently it is only a trial offer and it will only last one year. I am a bit disappointed because I have purchased this album partly because of this offer.
Got this one when it was on sale when it was first released.  Great pop album!  It's not Hendrix or Floyd by any means but a great listen when you just want some good jams to kick it with your friends.
"I'm not a huge fan of Lady Gaga (in the interest of full disclosure).  This album was $0.99 for the MP3 version and I knew my kids would want it. So I got it.Having said that I found many of Lady Gaga's tunes to be catchy and would even say she's this generation's Madonna- socially conscious fashion forward making great dance tunes.  I've watched a couple of interviews with her and I had heard Judas and Born This Way and found both songs to be pretty good.I put the album on in the background while I was working yesterday.  My thought on the first play through was the album was pretty boring.  Every song is almost exactly the same. There were no real break out songs here-other than the two I had already heard.  The beats are straight-on club beats.Today I gave the album a second play and it's already growing on me.  I was wrong about all the songs being exactly the same.  Even though they are all pretty much upbeat and loud there is some good music going on here.  And I love Lady Gaga's positive message to her ""little monsters"" to just be themselves- no matter who they are.So if you're like  me and don't fall in love with the album on the first play through give it another chance."
First off I really wish people would stop giving 1 star reviews because they cannot download the album. It's really annoying because it makes the album look bad. It's Amazon you need to review not GaGa.That said I love this album. I was a little nervous because I didn't know what to expect. Favorite song has to be Heavy Metal Lover. It's flawless. Other favorites included Government Hooker Bloody Mary Americano You and I Bad Kids..I guess I primarily just love the album for being fresh and a different vibe from Fame Monster/Fame. I'm a proud little monster and I'm raving.
Lady Gaga is such a talented person (as we all know) but this left me speechless! everything is written beautifully and is full of deep meaning and things this generation can relate to.Im actually listening to Hair right now! I honestly cant pick a song as a favorite because they truly are the most amazing lyrics and music I have ever heard.No I am not kiddingeither. Mother monster understands us and songs like hair have the power to make everyone feel strongconfidentand happy. Gaga is a talented artist and deserves all the little monsters and money she earns! &lt;3 so buy this cd because you will not regret it all.I honestly can say with no exaggeration that I listen to it every day and it never gets old. This album will be the best one you own.That's a promise
I didn't believe it when they emailed me saying that I could get the album the day it was released but for $.99 I took the chance.  It downloaded about 15 seconds later and I'm listening to it right now.  If you have any interest at all in the album buy it here. Great deal Amazon!
What can I say - by the Lady herself brilliant album especially like Electric Chapel - my favorite song. A very solid album.
this is terrible for a company like amazon to make such an offer you would expect it to work i have only been able to download two songs and have many errors connecting. If this does not work I will be a penny pincher and demand a refund.
So I downloaded it. I thought oh wow! That's really cheap!But then it won't download to ANYTHING.Not iTunes the Amazon Player.... anything.And when I saved it it won't play.I keep trying to re-download it but it doesn't work!!!I purchased this album with an Opera Web Browser this morning when they said it was working again.What a rip.
I like the dynamics of the songs. This is a great cd. I like to listen to it a lot. Darrell!!
This album is easily one of the best of this year. It truly distinguished itself from the rest of the pop tart albums and delivers strong messages and anthemic hooks. Standouts are Heavy Metal Lover Government Hooker Bloody Mary Judas and Marry The Night but honestly the whole damn album is good.
I am still in love with this album!! If you are questioning getting this CD Don't think any longer! The dark beats will blow your mind!
When I bought Born This Way a few months ago most of my contemporaries ( over 55 ) thought I'd lost my mind but I don't care; Lady Gaga is one of the most talented young women in Pop music today! Not only can she play the piano well but she sings better than most the current pop divas out there and even knows how to write! To top it all off she's great at choreography and fashion. I knew what I was doing when I ordered Born This Way and that I wasn't losing my mind. If the rest of them want to sit home and listen to Liberace records they are free to do so. I didn't get my open mind and free spirit appreciation for the arts in a class or through a guru. I was born this way.
I really enjoyed this album. Lady Gaga keeps pumping out the hits and I definitely love SEVERAL of these songs. Definitely not a one hit wonder albume!
I'm sure the album would be great. I love Lady Gaga and want to listen to it but only 1 song got copied to the cloud player. Um... Amazon... you might want to check/fix this. The review rating probably would be 5 outta 5 but since Amazon screwed something up.. it's only a 1 and should no way reflect Lady Gaga's talent as a artist.
"I was lucky enough to be able to start previewing songs fromBorn This Wayvia a game app on Facebook the week before the album was actually released and I have to admit that I was very skeptical at first about the direction of Lady Gaga's upcoming album.  Once I was able to purchase the mp3 download of the whole album and had a good listen to all of the songs I was blown away.  Other than the extremely commercialized title song ""Born This Way"" the rest of the album was absolute Gaga.  Strong driving beats lyrics that make you stop and think or wonder what the heck and Gaga's outstanding voice that simply cannot be denied.The style of songs is all over the place and in a good way that keeps you fully entertained.  Listening to Lady Gaga's newest album is like being at a live concert where you feel the artist is giving their all to the audience.  There may be a few songs on the album that some people don't much care for though personally I love the entire album.  However there's no denying that Lady Gaga puts forth her absolute best effort on every track and it definitely shows.  This album was clearly a labor of love and devotion by all involved in putting it together.I would hesitate to call the album a ""landmark"" album in the history of music but it is an excellent sophmore effort from a relatively new singer/artist to the world of music.  I would however dare to say that Lady Gaga is shaping up to be the ""Madonna"" of a new generation - unabashedly unashamed of who she is where she comes from and what she has to express in her music which I am quite happy about.  The biggest difference to me is that Lady Gaga can actually sing and quite well compared to Madonna especially in Madonna's earlier career.  And don't get me wrong here - Madonna is my ""queen"" from my younger days but Lady Gaga has unleashed a new ""queen"" to today's generation of young music listeners.  Just watch - I suspect that Lady Gaga like Madonna before her will be ""ruling the world"" for decades to come.Don't stop being weird freaky funky unashamed and totally entertaining Ms. Gaga."
This album is the best GaGa has come up with so far. I listen to it 24/7! This album is full of good feelings and empowerment. If you don't own this yet you need to. Everyone should have this album even if they dont really like Lady GaGa. It's a masterpiece I cant wait to see what she has in store for the next album!
I was hesitant but bought the CD because I'm a Gaga fan and because I had pre-ordered it in anticipation that I'd like most of the songs.  After a few listens I can't stop listening.  I think it's like some of Madonna's later work where it doesn't strike you immediately as being a hit but it grows on you very quickly!
Good things come to those that wait. I may have started to download 2 hrs ago. But with a lil patience the album is complete. Another fabulous album from Gaga! I think if everyone would relax breath and let the download do its thing youll be happy you did. May be slow....but definitely NOT a rip off!
This package is a collection of proof from a multi expressionist artist.Although it may appear that there are some simillairities with other musical artists it's still GaGa style. She got this unique voice to give you a smile on your face or a tear in your eye.The DVD resambles the same artistique qualities.If you may not like Lady GaGa for the other half sure this is an excellent historic Document.
save your money.  Worst album I have heard in a while worse than B Spears.  People will say its good because Gaga is trendy but its not.  Its really bad.  I want my $6.99 back
Great Lady Gaga CD! Lots of good songs on it. You'll play it a lot & not get bored with it.
"UGH UGH UGH UGH! I love Lady Gaga I thought her last two albums were absolutely FANTASTIC. I don't know what she was thinking when she wrote this pile of garbage. I have listened to it several times and I just can't stand it. Thank goodness it was only $0.99 otherwise I would have been even more disappointed.In fact I often found myself starting to sing Madonna songs as well as a few Depeche Mode songs when I first took a listen. I think this may be the end of Lady Gaga unless she can produce some amazing stuff like her last album quickly this just isn't going to cut it.She has been doing a fairly good job of building herself a cult following but this album can surely change all of that. It lacks originality and during one song she can't think of anything to say so she literally goes la la la oh ah ah. I am not joking! There should have been a hook there or something. It is very apparent that she wrote this crap while what were her words... oh yes ""I write all of my songs high on weed and smashed on whiskey"" (or something very close to that direct quote).Despite not being a fan of any of the new tracks she released on the radio prior to the album coming out I thought surely there has to be a few songs on the album that are true Lady Gaga style and what we (normal non monster) people have come to love about her. Nope nothing whoever is in charge of her career must think she can hop on a mic sing twinkle twinkle little star and sell a million copies.I have news for them this album is going to make everyone say where the hell did Lady Gaga go?!? It's time she takes off all the costumes and makeup and give us back the amazing songs and originality that we all have come to love. If she keeps producing this crap her and all her monsters will soon cease to exist."
Great price
Lets be serious here the rating system here is for the album NOT for the technical difficulty so all yall 1 star giver needs to chill out!I myself only have 2 songs showing up in my cloud downloader but for 99 cents you can't complain...Just think about it it cost $1.29 alone for one song at iTunes you get the whole album for less than the cost of one song!Of course its amazon's fault for not being ready for such a massive volume of download.Review:Much different from that of other gaga's song. This album is more dance oriented and has some very catchy beats(ke$ha). A lot of the songs sound very much like Madonna's but with gaga's own twist. I still personally like her first and second album more but I like her new approach and her experiments. The only thing I really dislike about this album is the freaky looking album cover.
I tried to order this digital download last night from Amazon.  The Gaga album wouldn't even begin to download at all.  I was sure that my unfamiliarity with using Amazon's digital download since I had never used it before had something to do with it.  But for $0.99 I went for it.  Then I started reading about the various issues that everyone was having.  So I thought I'd just wait for the server traffic to slow down and try again in the morning. Well today there's no sign that I even ordered it and now my only option is to re-purchase it at the usual Amazon price.  I've NEVER had any problems with NUMEROUS physical orders from Amazon.com but this ONE problem is enough to ruin my view of Amazon. I could understand if I simply had to wait for traffic to slow down and attempt to download the next day but the fact that I can't download the album AND it seems as if my order was never even processed I have to re-purchase at FULL PRICE.  Which if I decide to do will be done from iTunes.  BAD bad experience Amazon.
The Fame and The Fame Monster were truly pop classics.  That said Gaga's producer on The Fame chose to keep her vocals constrained into more manageable snippets using repetitive phrasing cool synths and clean dance beats.  With the Fame Monster the producers decided to let Gaga go into a longer format singing style using more analog instruments and limiting the cut up simplified and electropop mixes that were on The Fame.With 'Born This Way' the producers have once again allowed Gaga to expand her vocals even further choosing to steer away from the cleaner dance pop arrangements into longer format vocals.  Also they have added electric guitar and other genres into her songs.  While that's not necessarily a bad thing it does make this album sound much less like the Gaga we have come to know on The Fame.  Instead this Gaga is actually singing the number (for the most part) rather than singing clips and letting the mix engineer arrange the pieces into a song.That said I would have preferred a combination somewhere in the middle.  Give us some natural vocal arranged songs like Marry The Night Born This Way Judas and Schei&szlig;e but also give us some lighter dance pop songs like Pokerface Just Dance and Love Game. Unfortunately we don't really get much of lighter fare on Born This Way.  So don't go into this CD expecting much of what you heard on The Fame.  In fact Born This Way is more like The Fame Monster than The Fame.  In places it also sounds strikingly like Madonna.On the production side this CD is way overproduced. There's far too much reverb on many of the songs the compression is too strong leaving the audio spectrum flat with far too little bottom end.  Comparing production of The Fame to Born This way there really is no comparison.  The Songs on The Fame are crisp clear and her vocals are front and center.  On Born This Way her vocals are buried too deep in the mix the compression causes the sound to attenuate too much leaving the songs sounding weak and unnatural.  The sound engineer needed to reduce the compression a lot and re-EQ the entire mix to sound clearer and crisper.  Also whomever decided to go with distorted vocals in this mix should have been pulled from the project.  Distorted vocals never sound good and especially make this CD sound annoying rather than pleasant.As for the songs themselves I wanted a chance to listen to the songs a bit before reviewing.  Now that I've had a week to digest the compositions and arrangements here's the rest of this review.  For this CD Lady Gaga would have done better to hold mix contests.  Put the stems out there and let remixers and DJs have at it. Does that mean the mixes on Born This Way are bad?  Well let's just say that they are far weaker in arrangements than what's on The Fame.  Extreme care was taken crafting the songs on The Fame and to some extent The Fame Monster. Unfortunately that level of care didn't carry into Born This Way. Now some of that may be the compositions but most of it is the choice of beats and choruses.  In some songs there almost seems to be a case of adult deficit disorder.  That is lots of mini-songs strung together to create a whole song rather than attempting to craft an entire song.Musically the most cohesive songs (and the most like The Fame) are Marry The Night Government Hooker Judas Schei&szlig;e Bloody Mary Black Jesus + Amen Fashion (which might as well be Madonna) and Born This Way.  Now that's not to say they sound completely like The Fame but they do sound the closest to The Fame that you'll find on this release.  The rest of the songs are fair and have their moments but just aren't cohesive or dare I even say 'filler'.  Specifically Bad Kids sounds like circa 1979 disco Fashion Is His Love is just straight mid-80s dance and Electric Chapel just tries way too hard but never gets there.  In fact the rest of the songs all try way too hard but never reach the level of the material on The Fame.  Basically the melodies the songs not mentioned are too straightforward without a Lady Gaga spin on the material. Literally anyone could be singing the rest of the material and worse it's just not that strong.The second disc is remixes of songs from disc 1. All I have to say about the remixes is why bother? If these mixes represent the best remixes she could find I'm at a loss. The best remix on disc 2 is Marry The Night but unfortunately only lasts for 59 seconds before turning sour.  In fact for that intro of 59 seconds that mix sounds amazing and is far better than the 'real' mix on the first disc. I absolutely love the piano only mix for that 59 seconds. it's too bad Lady Gaga (or whomever) didn't choose that sound for the 'real' mix.Finally the last problem.  I purchased the deluxe edition assuming it would not be censored.  Unfortunately this is not the Explicit version.  In the Queen track the arrangers have censored a word from the song leaving a noticeable drop out.  Instead they could at least get Gaga to sing an alternative word instead of just blanking out the audio.  This sounds cheap and unprofessional.  Be advised if you purchase this edition.. it is not the Explicit version and is clearly edited.
After listening to samples I decided Born This Way was one of the CD's to purchase.  In my opinion Gaga is one of the best &#34;current&#34; female artists.
I quite like this album more than I thought I would. I'm not a huge fan of the song Born This Way (good message annoying song) or Judas (it's kind of catchy but overall pass).For $0.99 (go go student download!!) I figured why not. And it is definitely quirkier than her first 2 albums. Side note though it takes a year and a half to download. I'm not sure why I've never had this problem with amazon MP3 downloader but it's been downloading for roughly an hour and I've received half the album. From what I've heard interesting songs to listen to so far are tracks 7 & 9. Also I'm not sure if there is an unedited version but if there is it would've been nice to have advertised that instead of this.
The best purchase ever  :)  I listen to this album all day at work and just love it !  I find myself humming many of the songs :)
"Although a one time Gaga enthusiast I am thoroughly disappointed by the new album... It somehow manages to be the usual ""too much"" and boring at the same time. It's not all bad but I give it one star for the disappointment factor. It probably works for the very young generation who is just discovering the magical and heady mix of symbols of art sex and religion... Well hello guys Madonna was there first - a long long time ago - built an impressive career on all that... I just don't see the interest of putting such frantic effort into producing something that is d&eacute;j&agrave; vu and d&eacute;j&agrave; heard..."
I wish Amazon allowed returns for digital downloads. I'd surely return this. I'm a big fan of Gaga but this album is bad. It sounds like a bad 80s album. Well at least the songs I could listen to. Amazon only allowed me to download 9 of the 15 songs I bought. So maybe the 6 songs I didn't get are worth it. I'm so glad I only paid 99cents for this thing. I'd be so mad if I paid full price. Sorry Gaga I think you missed the mark on this one. Better luck next time.
This is definitely the best cd I have ever bought (and i've bought alot of cds!) If you're thinking about buying this cd BUY IT!!! Every song is wonderful! Best songs are Government Hooker Judas and Bloody Mary! Must buy this cd!
I never got the download for this. It was back when this album sold for only one dollar. I shouldnt complain but a dolar is still a dollar and Amazon did follow up with my purchase.
I don't know why this is but when I try to convince people that Lady Gaga is actually good no one pays attention because I'm a crazy fan of hers. But seriously one thing is being a fan another is knowing it's good. I'm a fan of High School Musical and I know the movies suck and I can't say no to that... But Gaga is completely different.Born This Ways is a ride through Gaga's mind seeing things from her political views to her love for fashion and her experiences as a rebellious teenager. Born This Way the song as she describes it is a gateway drug to the album. It's an amazing pop song with fresh beats and very literal lyrics (critics say that's not good but they also say lyrics that are to hard to understand aren't good either...) Marry The Night a very probable single is a fantastic up-beat piece with incredible vocals - one of my favorites just like Hair is which is about Gaga's struggle as a young woman to free herself through her hair and her parents not letting her. Other Gaga classics include Schei&szlig;e and second single Judas (which might not have gotten a lot of attention but that I find very interesting and great especially the way she puts her cheating boyfriends into the Judas betrayal story).But I can't restring myself to the now-usual (and updated) Gaga songs. The album is made of many new sounds like The Edge of Glory a song released as a promotional single that rose to number one in several iTunes stores worldwide making itself the official third single. The tune is a sort of ballad that sounds amazing just with a piano and her voice but that with the whole Gaga-Fernando Garibay (remember Fernando from the 'Alejandro' lyrics? He produced the fan-favorite 'Dance in the Dark') production shows a complete new leveled Lady Gaga with huge vocals and even a solo by Clarence Clemons from The E Street Band.Also Government Hooker featuring Gregorian chants and that is about people knowing things are wrong in the political system but not doing anything because it gives them money. Another remarkable songs include Fashion of His Love MJ-liked to my ear about Alexander McQueen; Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) with mad vocals and great variations in the song; Black Jesus ' Amen Fashion a very electro-driven song I'd say; and possibly Americano which I don't like at all but can recognize that it is a very fresh kind of tune with a latin music thing going on and a strong message.The never forgotten ballad of the album is Yo&uuml; and I which sang live sounds incredible but that with the electric guitar playing in the background makes it even more amazing. I could say what the song is about but she doesn't want people to know (I'm sure you'll easily find the inspiration with a little Google-ing if you want to).I hope this is enough for you to get the CD but if it isn't I'm sorry. I tried my best to show you how Born This Way isn't some kind of ordinary forgettable album; it's a pop masterpiece with a whole lot of rock jazz and electro influences setting The Fame Monster as background. So get it because I'm pretty sure you'll be less cultured if you haven't heard this piece of art.
What if we don't use the Cloud player?? I have been waiting since 8am Central time. My songs from Amazon are moved  to my iTunes.... I am getting impatient because I want to listen to this album so bad! Can anyone help??! I love Gaga!!
I saw this promotion on Facebook and thought I'd give it a look. I admit I don't know much Lady Gaga music so I figured for $.99 for the complete album I'd give it shot. This is a great deal for someone like me who probably wouldn't have purchased the album otherwise. Thanks Amazon.
I revise my one star rating which was of Amazon's service and not the album which is very good.  I also forgive Amazon's initial delay since they sold me this album for $0.99.  Good deal good album!  Love my gaga
Album is ok. I bought it because it was 99.  Although not part of my star rating I had no problem downloading the album. Thanks Amazon.
What an album!! I'm a Gaga Fan so I waited until they finally released on Amazon... and to my surprise it was only a buck. I bought the 99 cent version and opted to buy the 3 bonus tracks since it only ended up costing me 4 bucks all together! By far the album is a growth. Still Gaga and still catchy in that gaga way. Take a hit and pay that 99 cents and even if you don't end up liking the whole album you basically got it for the price of one.
"It seems to be Sensationalism for Sensationalism's sake. Boring. And the whole `offensive religious' lyrics thing is not even relevant. I mean come on Obama's president now and gay marriage is almost legal. It's not the Reagan/Bush eras anymore. But I guess it goes along with her whole ""see I can do anything I want"" stuff she has been up to lately. This album could have been an evolution of her talent if only the whole album could have felt like the only 3 good songs on it: Government Hooker ScheiBe and Heavy Metal Lover. The other songs sound like very unpleasant noise and are not enjoyable. Lady Gaga is wildly talented and I will watch and wait for her to return to expressing her true talent instead of asking for attention."
Daughter had to have it. To me ordering a digital download isnot as good as a real CDbut very affordable and immediate. Record has high and low points.
Lady GaGa is Awesome! I am positive that I will not be disappointed with this album either. Especially for ninety-nine cents. Cry Cry away you little one star reviewers!!! For ninety-nine cents what do you expect from the server! Especially when they do it with a star of this magnitude! I mean come on people!! If you have heard and liked the song Born This Way then that is enough to buy the whole cd. You would pay this much just for the one song so please stop your crying about the technical problems and just wait it out. Amazon has posted that if you buy it today you will get all the songs.
It took 5 hours to download the album.  I guess I should be thrilled that Amazon downloaded three mp3s of each song to my iTunes library.
Wish they could have an explicit version out but its an amazing deal so...Love this album- great tracks to rock out to. Has a retro vibe which is totally cool.Get these songs stuck in your head!
"This review is going to cover the whole record.MARRY THE NIGHT - I absolutely love this song. It is a very solid record. It has the vocals the lyrics everything.BORN THIS WAY - This was the perfect choice for the first single. It did amazingly. And it should NOT be skipped going to anything new. NEVER SKIP THE SINGLES!! It destroys he experience of hearing the record.GOVERNMENT HOOKER - I just love this song so much. If it was a single I would be so excited I would possibly pass out. Its filthy its dirty its just amazing.JUDAS - This was the perfect choice for the second single. It is amazing and its placing after Government Hooker instrumentally is genius.AMERICANO - This song is written from her view of the immigration laws and it shows. But it shows lightly enough you almost have to hear her say that or know she said it because until the end its hidden in a relation ship with Lady Gaga and a woman.HAIR - I love the bubbly beginning and the then rock sound. It is very amazing.SCHEI&szlig;E - Schei&szlig;e is a great great record! I love the song so much it has the most plays on my iTunes so far. It is definitely one of the top songs of the record.BLOODY MARY - Epic song. Just epic.BLACK JESUS  AMEN FASHION - This song is plainly great. It is about putting on a new spirit as easily as fashion and it shows perfectly.BAD KIDS - An amazing anthem about how people considered ""bad kids"" and people who fell like them. I feel very connected to this record and I love it so much.FASHION OF HIS LOVE - I love this record a lot. It was written after Alexander McQueen's death. I love how it shows that love is more than love its also a fashion statement.HIGHWAY UNICORN (ROAD TO LOVE) - I just can't express how I love this record - verbally or physically.HEAVY METAL LOVER - This record is also filthy. It is less filthy than Government Hooker but its very filthy. The first line so filthy its amazing. This song is a great record.ELECTRIC CHAPEL - This record is definitely close to the best record. Out of all of them. I can't get enough of it.THE QUEEN - I giggle a lot when I listen to it. The lyrics are playful and amazing. I worship The Queen.YO&Uuml; AND I - This is definitely a wonderful and fun song. I do enjoy the whole track and I enjoy the part about her dad Nebraska and Jesus. ""There's only three men that I'mma serve for my whole life/It's my daddy and Nebraska and Jesus Christ"".THE EDGE OF GLORY - This is the perfect closer of the record. I love how upbeat it is when its about your last moments. Its purely fantastic."
"99 cents? She's practically giving it away as a compensation to make up for the lack of quality. Born This Way is a very disappointing follow up to The Fame Monster. I agree that artists should ""evolve"" but she seems to have ""devolved"".  I don't know how to put it delicately it's so bad that the U.S. Government will probably play this record in their interrogations to torture people. Yes this may be the most top selling album out at the moment but it is still a FLOP in my eyes.Anyone who gives this album 5 stars is delusional."
"This download cost me $0.99 and I still feel like I overpaid. I found myself switching over to her first album instead.This album feels pretentious and self-absorbed to the point of being flat-out irritating. Overall it's a good deal for avid fans but those who preferred ""The Fame"" may want to skip this one."
Beautiful. Lady Gaga is such an amazing artist. There are so many songs and each one tells a different story. I could listen to this album forever.It's a wonderful buy and well put together.
When I first heard this album I didn't think it was anywhere near as good as Lady Gaga's others but after listening to it for a while it has really grown on me. Some of the songs are different and interesting including Bloody Mary Amen Fashion and Government Hooker. Some of the songs have horn in them giving them a strange 70s sound that I didn't really like but where Lady Gaga stayed true to her art the songs are great. Lady Gaga is very inspirational and a lot of fun. I highly recommend the album (I paid full price for the CD).
I like Gaga and this CD is okay although I really don't think it compares to her first CD. I am sure after listening to it more I will like it more also.
One of the great 21st Century albums  Born this Way will live as an anthem forever in American popular music culture.  The whole sound of the album will come to define this era.  Love the Gaga.  Must buy the Gaga.  Don't let the Gaga pass you by.
This is a phenomenal dance disc... takes me back to my days (or should I say nights) in the gay dance clubs.  The people posting 1 star reviews need to learn some restaint and patience.  I'm sure Amazon has never had demand on the downloader like they are having today.  C'mon people Gaga for $.99... common sense would dictate that downloads will be slow in coming.  I'm being patient knowing that all of my downloads will be here eventually!
First the technology. It's 3pm Eastern. I paid for the album and was able to immediately listen on the Cloud so no complaints. Just wanted to reassure those who anticipate problems. Not sure what's up with the digital booklet but am assuming it will appear when I download the album. Still on my first listen only to third track and am digging it. Gaga continues to create a mix of light-hearted pop and social commentary all in the groove.
This album is perfect. It's beautiful it's inspiring and it's worth every penny! Each song is so unique yet they all seem to go together so well. Born This Way (the song) is so uplifting and it speaks to anyone who will let it in. The Edge of Glory is just beautiful. You and I just makes me feel good :)  Heavy Metal Lover is my favorite off the album and it's EXTREMELY addictive. I don't have time to say anything about the rest of the songs but if you buy the album you won't regret it.
Very different from what Gaga has made in the past but still good in its own way. Feels a little more on the generic side than her last album but I still like it alot especially since she is still provocative and pushing people to understand the world in a broader sense. I love you Gaga!
I don't even like Lady Gaga but 99 cents for a whole album why not?  Guess what.. got one song!  Waited a couple hours kept reloading Cloud Player.. still only one song.  Sounds more like a scam to me.
This would be great if I could actually get the download to work.  can not wait to hear it when the download actually starts.
ive never bought a lady gaga album before- i took a chance and i really really like it.........its good to get you singing and dancing to! you cant deny this woman has alot of talent! I give this cd 5 stars for sure!
I have been using AmazonMP3 for several years now and the technical difficulties are extremely rare! They are almost always cheaper than iTunes and they even automatically add the tracks to iTunes for those really technically challenged people.Now on to Born This Way.I think it's important to note that I am a casual fan and not a Little Monster. With that being said I'd say this album goes right in sync with her other material. It's not award winning lyrically and actually pretty cheesy quite often. However Lady Gaga makes up for her often uninspiring lyrics with grand theatrics and sheer musical genius. She's actually a talented singer who does not need to rely on the hated auto-tunes. She is also a talented musician with a background playing the piano. Finishing it off she hires some of the best musicians to help co-write her songs and the best producers to complement her personality/style. Overall I'd say this album is filled with more than enough quality pop gems that will no doubt be over-played for the next 2 years until Gaga releases her next monster album.
Amazon really does not know what it is doing here. I purchased this album downloaded the installer and just waited and waiting.  Nothing happened.  Before Amazon introduced this cloud music disaster albums were easy to purchase and download.  Now it's a total nightmare.  How many hours do we have to wait before the songs become available?  I guess you get what you pay for.
I'm still in the process of listening to the entire album (so far I would rate it 4 stars) but I felt I needed to write a quick review about Amazon.Via my Android phone today I went to the Amazon MP3 app and 15 seconds later I had purchased the album (late morning here in California) and started listening to it right away.  ZERO problems.  99 cents for the entire album!  Even if you just enjoy 2 or 3 of the songs that is a bargain compared to other services.
Great album!  I really like Gaga she is a true artist and brings visual sound and fashion back to music!  Can't wait for the new CD in October!!
"I never really paid much attention to Lady Gaga. I overheard this album earlier this week over a friend's house and went out a bought it the next day. There are some *extremely* innovative things going on in this record and if you dig below the dance beats there are songs that were written from the ground up and not patched together in the studio like a lot of dance music. Her vocals are truly inspiring and for anyone that thinks Lady Gaga is a Madonna knockoff consider Gaga's musical background. I don't believe she is pandering to a gay audience because the songs are too good. At 45 years old I don't hear much music anymore that I would call ""innovative"" but this album knocks my socks off. Bravo!"
"Towards the end of her touring activities in 2011 Lady Gaga released the smash single ""Born This Way"" in February 2011 and it became an instant success topping the charts in various countries across the globe in just a few days. ""Judas"" followed in April 2011 and a month later the album Born This Way was released to rave reviews and positive reception from Gaga's fan base. The hits kept on coming with the release of her singles ""The Edge of Glory"" ""You and I"" and ""Marry the Night"" which also achieved great success on the charts. In 2012 she embarked on the Born This Way Ball World Tour touring countries in Asia Europe Africa Oceania and South America and in 2013 she's returning to the USA to tour and she may be coming to a city near you. Anyway great album and besides the singles other great songs on the album are ""Americano"" ""Schiebe"" and ""Hair"". In my opinion this is the best album of 2011."
I am a huge gaga fan and i haddddd to have this this thank you fast shipping i give them a A+
Lady Gaga has achieved amazing music status again with Born This Way! Probably one of the best concept albums yet it's got something for everyone from mainstream to underground to rock. I recommend it to anyone.
The best Lady Gaga album ever. I like all of the songs and I found my new favorite song You and I. I would highly recommended this if you are a huge Gaga fan.
"Lady GaGa has finally reached that lofty level where anything she releases is snapped up by everyone (I'm guilty too) - especially at 99 cents.  After listening to this I can tell she has lost her creative muse and is now just making noise for money.  It's comical to hear all the humming and ""la la la dum de dum"" gibberish  excessive repetition and abbreviated lyrics.  If you added all the lyrics up from all the songs I'd be surprised if you would end up with enough for a small paragraph.  Oh the music was unremarkable and under-whelming.  This marks the beginning of the end."
Best album I've ever heard. I never liked EVERY song on an album before so this is truly a amazing album! &lt;3
"Words cannot describe how amazing this album and Lady Gaga is. I pre-ordered it and waited in anticipation as the months went by for Born This Way. When i finally got it and listened to it I was blown away. It was just so much more than I expected. ""Bad Kids"" is a favorite. It explains my life perfectly. It's really quite amazing. I love this album and I love you Lady Gaga."
Born This Way is the best album I have listened in my entire life. The best songs to me ? Government Hooker is my favourite one. This song is so sexy I love it. Then Marry The Night. It MUST be a single this song is a hit. The bells at the beggining are wonderful. To finished Judas Born This Way The Edge of Glory Yo&uuml; And I Highway Unicorn and Electric Chapel are awesome in my opinion. Buy Born This Way you will not be disappointed!
Previously left a 1-star review because of the frustrations with downloading.  Editing this review to 4-stars because this is a great album at a ridiculously awesome price.  WOULD rate it 5-stars if the downloading process would have gone more smoothly.
I can't go a day without listening to this album I think it's GaGa's best yet.. she's grown so much since The Fame. It takes more than one listen to fully appreciate but overall it's an amazing album. Britney and Katy etc can't touch it. My favorite tracks are: Heavy Metal Lover Marry The Night The Edge of Glory Hair and Judas. The only track I really dislike is Americano but others love it.
"I've seen some of her videos and heard the singles but I must admit I never paid much attention to Lady Gaga. Curious I took the bite on the 99 cent deal (by the way no problems with the download and the Cloud Player is great). Wow am I impressed! This is an excellent collection of songs - with influences from rock country pop electronica club - it's all in there and expertly produced. My favorites are ""Electric Chapel"" which flat out rocks ""The Edge of Glory"" a power pop song with a great beat and Gaga's super vocal performance (sure to be a single) ""Judas"" ""Americano"" with the Spanish/calypso influence ""Hair"" and its piano/organ/sax/synth sounds (very unexpected) ""Born This Way"" a new arena anthem if there ever was one. Not only everything musically interesting Lady Gaga sounds like she is having a lot of fun. There are many comparisons to draw to Madonna but Gaga's sound is distinctly hers and thoroughly modern. Put aside the meat dress and listen for the music. It's the best album I've heard all year... and I'm 57 years old. Does this make me a little monster? Yikes..."
I love this new album! It is sassy sexy and addictive! It is her best so far! You've done it again Lady Gaga.
I was actually not expecting much from this attempt. Note: Everytime an artist brags about how they are going to release something great it usually never is and she went overboard I think saying that it would be the greatest album of the decade (I am paraphrasing here).You definitely have to listen to it a few times to kind of get into it. I am not a huge fan (I do like some of her songs) and had it not been $0.99 I definitely would not have bought it but because of the price I decided to take the plunge (better than buying a single or two for $1.29). Most of the songs sound the same...I do like Americano Hair and Marry The Night but they are by no means groundbreaking (I like the beats/background). I feel like on this attempt she was just trying way too hard to please all of her fans (which every artist is guilty of) and I feel like she is being too preachy just to be preachy rather than being sincere.Just an okay for me.
All you guys rating this album low for the download problems are really screwing it up for people on the fence about buying it! All the low ratings make it look like the album sucks which it doesn't. I don't think it's as great at TFM but it's hard to surprise ppl twice. If you like any of GaGa's songs you'll like this album too.
I'm up to five songs after an hour...I'm sure the Amazon servers are overwhelmed by such a great deal.  I'm going to have a spot of tea and some breakfast get the kids to school then check the progress.  Patience is a virtue...
Stop complaining. Obviously everyone is trying to download this album all at once. It's a lot for the server to handle and they're working on it. Amazon is too big of a company to cheat you over. Just have patience and be excited that you only had to pay a dollar for this great album!
"Born This Way may not be your typical pop album but it was definitely made with a certain target audience in mind. The album includes a lot of catchy melodies and lyrics spanning a wide range of the musical spectrum. On this album you can find pop rock electro retro 80's and a whole lot more. It's clear Gaga was inspired by a lot when creating this masterpiece.Personally this album speaks to who I am as a person and the beliefs I have. If you are a Gaga fan this album will NOT disappoint! Personally some of my favorite (non-single) tracks include: ""Heavy Metal Lover"" ""Bloody Mary"" and ""Bad Kids."" Every Gaga fan has their own favorite and most of the time it's not the same exact track. Every track on this album has a purpose and message.If you haven't given BORN THIS WAY a try yet then you truly are missing out musically and otherwise!"
This album is one of the best I've heard in a long time! There are so many different styles of song and they all make you want to pump your fists!! Marry the Night is the perfect song to start off the album it really sets the mood. And it ends with The Edge of Glory also perfect as the last song since it's about death. I recommend listening to it from start to finish so you can really get a feel of what she has accomplished. Amazing!
who doesn't love lady gaga?  all the songs are great and has a flow that sucks you into the music.  i keep listening to it over and over to get all the lines down!  love it.
"First let me say I was lucky enough to purchase and download this gem of an album early this morning before all the trouble started...yippee 4 me.Second...""BORN THIS WAY"" IS THE SHIIIIIIIIIIZZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I was not all that impressed with the first couple of singles but the rest of the album is the work of the ""GaGa Freak"" I know and love.THANK YOU LADY GAGA FOR DELIVERING THE GOODS!  YOU ARE A...SUPER*STARPOP*GENIUSROCK*GODDESSFREAK*ADVOCATEDIVA*EXTRAORDINAIRE...and I love you."
Lady Gaga is already a parody but she's becoming a parody of a parody. Boring predictable -- you already know whatever she is going to say or do before she does it. Just stop with thinking anyone cares what you think and get back to signing songs that get suck in peoples heads.
"I finally got my copy after waiting almost a month from pre-ordering it. When it finally arrived and I listened to the whole album I realized that this had been censored. The most notable censorship is on the song ""Government Hooker"". This is a GREAT song but the lyrics have been censored. When I called Amazon customer service they have advised me that this is the only version available from the manufacturer. It was not advertized in any way as being a censored product so in that respect alone I am disappointed and in Amazon as the only solution was to return the item for a full refund. After waiting in anticipation for a month I am torn on what to do. I love the album otherwise. The variety of the music and lyrics make this album a must have for any true little monster. My only advice would be to Amazon to make sure in the future that they know the details of what they are getting from their suppliers before issuing pre-sale on the albums. I am sure that I am not the only one that was disappointed to find out that my long awaited copy of ""Born This Way"" by the Mother Monster herself Lady GaGa had been censored. I am sure that she wouldn't have wanted it this way..."
"I have listened to this album over and over again to try and appreciate it and for it to grow on me.Because after the 1st listen I was not impressed.The album seemed like 1 long track to me with very few intermissions of great songs.I have now realized that the album didn't grow on me and that it is kind of a disappointment.After ""The Fame"" which I mostly loved (bar a few filler tracks) and ""The Fame Monster"" which in my mind was a fantastic album bordering on the accessible and avant-garde but just poppy enough to be a radio staple.""Born This Way"" doesn't continue this trend. You can tell Gaga tried to make power choruses and be radio friendly but it gets washed in with the heavy production which seems very lethargic and just TOO much to me.The album starts relatively strong with ""Marry The Night"" the mega over played smash ""Born This Way"" the intriguing and the very dark ""Government Hooker"".Then comes ""Judas"" which I thought had potential to be a really amazing song but is ruined by the Dance-Dance-Revolutionish chorus.""Americano"" is really over the top and ridiculous.""Schei&szlig;e"" is probably one of my favourite tracks. It again borders on mainstream accessibility and complete darkness which is interesting to listen to.""You & I"" is hands down the best thing on this album. Its a fantastic song and highly recommended. It doesnt really fit in the context of the album but its a welcome surprise after the huge filler gap of tracks 8-15""The Edge of Glory"" is the 3rd single and a great closer.Unfortunately for me the tracks in between these songs are major filler in my honest opinion. They go on about 2 minutes too long and dont really give you a reason to stick around and listen to it.It doesnt pack the accessibility punch nor the dark avant garde punch.Its just below average background music and was very dissapointing after multiple listens.The only tracks in my mind worth RAVING about are Government Hooker Schei&szlig;e You & I and The Edge of Glory.Luckily for Gaga the public and her Little Monsters eat everything she does up even if the product is inferior and this will lead to huge sales. (That and her hawking the album for 99c on Amazon and giving it away with every phone purchase at Best Buy..which is really not an admirable thing to do as an artist in my opinion)I honestly cant see any of these singles taking off and being a #1 worldwide smash like she did with ""The Fame"" and ""The Fame Monster"" and they probably wont.But I'll give her credit where credits due and that is with the few songs I mentioned which are superior to a lot of songs on the radio right now."
I'm a Lady Gaga fan and I think this is one of her best albums.  I play it while skiing hard and fast..  BORN THIS WAY -- as I spray great rooster-tails of snow in this direction and that all over anyone who gets too close.  No apologies just like Lady G.
I just downloaded this and it did take awhile but I did get all the songs. Some people need to exercise some thing called patience. It's a good thing. Anyways great deal and great songs to work out to.
1.  I just bought the BORN THIS WAY/GAGA digital album download from Amazon & had no problems whatsoever.  Surprisingly it was quick & since Ive never bought an mp3 dig download from Amazon before it was a lot easier then expected.2.  I did not buy the .99 digital album but the $6.99 album to get the booklet & to thank Gaga/Record Industry for finally giving us a reasonably priced album.  Thanks to all fans do appreciate it.  And Ill continue to buy from Amazon if they have reasonably priced dig downloads for full albums.3.  My review of the album:  As a long time fan of Lady Gaga I have to say this is her weakest album yet.  All the songs are mediocre at best & nothing stands out as a favorite.  Also I couldnt help but notice all the songs (except 1) were written by others NOT Gaga herself.  This perhaps is the problem.  Gaga needs to pen the songs herself to give us the personal edge weve come to expect from her.  Lyrically the songs are repetitive generic & forgettable.  Musically they seem to be pseudo-dance as the dance beats seem to be an after thought.  All in all Im so very sad to say this album is her worst yet.4.  Note to Gaga:  Stop all this performance art bs & get back to song writing.  Thats where your strengths are & thats why we love your music.
Bloody Mary and Heavy Mental Lover are WICKED songs - my absolute favorites from this album. But that Americano song needs to go. Overall great album!!
really love it.to make it more perfect more stuffs should be added like maybe THE FAME MONSTER and THE FAME?
Mother monster did it again!!! She dominated the billboards with this album! I absolutely love You and I!!! She is an inspiration and is loyal to her fans. Great performer live too! LOVE YOU LADY GAGA!!!!
While there are a couple of Lady Gaga songs like Pokerface that I have heard in the past and really like this isn't a genre of music that I really listen to much and I wouldn't consider myself a fan before now.  I would have probably never bought this album (unless I heard it first - it turned out to be great) but saw it on the gold box deal the first day it was listed and for .99 I figured it was worth it for the cloud storage.  I personally was surprised and pleased with this album.  It is an awesome work and shows a number of different styles that show her talent from the electro sounds of Heavy Metal Lover to the more metal(ish - it's relative here) sounds of Electric Chapel.  There are more songs on this album that I like than I find on most albums in the genres from bands I prefer.  While the cover art might be a little scary the music content is at least to me awesome.I don't think the samples you can play for this do the album justice.  Best .99 I've spent.
I ordered this album ahead of time the priced dropped by a few bucks so amazon charged me the lowest price so from the get-go things were doing well. Awesome CD worth every penny and im sorry for people who seeem to had problems downloading the album hopefully its fixed quickly so everyone can enjoy the newest Lady Gaga songs.
Great beats great lyrics awesome album.  Please don't give this album a bad rating just because Amazon's servers were overloaded.  That has nothing to do with the album itself!
"FIRST:  ""HELLOOO WAKE UP!--PEOPLE YOU'RE GETTING A BRAND-NEW MAJOR FULL-LENGTH ALBUM FOR 99 CENTS!!!  LOL!!!  I don't care what your theory is about Gaga wanting to be #1 or what WAKE UP AND REALIZE SHE'S GIVING YOU THE CHANCE TO OWN FOURTEEN BRAND NEW SONGS for 99 CENTS!  You are out a whopping total of 99 cents (and yes you will get the whole album--the servers are just overwhelmed and slowed from the massive response--I called Amazon's customer service they picked up in 5 minutes and verified this).  No matter how you look at that it's astonishing and a wonderful gift to pop music lovers.  Give her a break--she loves making music singing it live (yep a pop star that can actually write her own songs and is able to sing them live as well!) and loves her fans.  She has said many times it's not all about money and this only proves she puts her money where her mouth is just as she did when she admirably canceled the Target Store exclusive deluxe version of this album when she learned they continued to give contributions to anti-gay political candidates.  Finally an artist we can believe in AND celebrate and dance with because she sticks to her beliefs does what she says she's going to and makes such darned good enjoyable music as well!  For heaven's sake people buy the album for 99 cents get up and dance and enjoy!!!  This album's lyrics are all about feeling good about yourself so why not do so and stop all the online arguing!??!  GET UP AND DANCE!!!  Enjoy life for once!!!"
"I haven't been able to listen to the whole album yet but I thought Amazon was genius with this deal.  I have been loyal to iTunes for years now but when I read an article about how Amazon was selling Gaga's new albums for $0.99 I was curious.  I was not going to buy the whole album from iTunes because I very rarely like Gaga's full albums but I couldn't not take advantage of this deal.Yes the download is slow but that is because so many people are taking advantage of this deal.  I didn't download it to Amazon's Cloud Player just to my computer.  I had to hit ""Retry"" about four times but after that it worked fine.  I will be taking advantage of Amazon's MP3 store more often now!"
I did not like anything about this album. I didn't like the transition she made none of the songs made me wanna dance
"As a huge fan of Lady Gaga i bought this album very quickly once it was released.  I was hoping that there wouldnt be strictly ""Meaningful"" songs if you will like Born This Way ( Which was a great song).  I was hoping that there would also be fun songs like what made me love Gaga in the first place.  I was pleasantly surprised!  Most artists will sing a few songs that have meaning and a few about going to the club poppin bottles and getting home late.  Lady Gaga spent time and put thought into this album and was able to write songs that were exciting and upbeat but werent based on shallow topics.  GREAT album If your on the fence go for it!"
I have a theory about albums-they are like a dozen eggs.If a typical album were a dozen eggs when you opened the carton you would find 2 stunning Grade AA Jumbo-size perfectly shaped white eggs. Next to them would be a few gleaming Grade A large eggs. The rest of the eggs in the box would be small odd-shapped dirty eggs and one or two of them might even be a little smelly. In other words most albums contain a pair of great songs a couple of OK songs and then the fillers needed to complete the album.Compared to a 'typical' album The Fame Monster contained eight Grade AA Jumbo perfect eggs and four of Grade A Large eggs. The Fame Monster was as good as an album can get period.Born this Way is not quite another Fame Monster. but it is MUCH better than a typical album. The more I have listened to this album the more it grows on me. There are many superb songs on this album (Born this Way Judas Marry the Night Hair Government Hooker Fashion of His Love and You and I) and in particular the Edge of Glory is an amazing and awe-inspiring song-the number of covers that have appeared on YouTube in a week is proof that it touches a lot of people. Unfortunately there are a couple weaker songs on the album.Let me put it in baseball terms: The Fame Monster was a Grand Slam while Born this way is a three-run homer and thus still better than 99% of all albums written these days.Every fan of pop music should own a copy.PS I am not a typical Lady Gaga fan-I am 57 no nothing about music and pay little attention to music in general. But I love her music and have attended two of her concerts.
These fools who are rating it 1 star probably don't like gaga anyway..... It's better than anything Gaga has ever done and is critically acclaimed so extremely negative comments are probably from people who wouldn't appreciate anything she does. It's definitely worth a dollar LOL I'd pay 40 dollars for this album.
Lady Gaga has a new edgier sound but she continues to show the genius and variety that marked The Fame and The Fame Monster. I've read other reveiws that comment on the variety of sounds on this album. They have evidently forgotten the difference in tracks on The Fame and The Fame Monster. Just Dance and Eh Eh (Nothing Else I Can Say) are as different as Judas and The Edge of Glory. Like any album it has its gems but even the tracks that will remain less well known show the polish and genius that would make a charting single for most other artists.This album is the next step on the journey she started with The Fame Monster. Musically she voyages to a new place while lyrically she gets more personal with songs about life and love and parents who don't appreciate her. This album is aimed and her little monsters with tracks ready to play in the clubs and lyrics to inspire others put down by their peers and family.This Deluxe edition is definitely worth it for the additional songs and the remix disc. Truly a deluxe offering musically. I highly recommend this to all Gaga's little montsters.
"Sad I loved her previous work but this just didn't do it for me at all (""To each his own"" though right?)."
Gotta love amazon! I'm not really a Gaga fan but once I saw the deal amazon was running I couldn't pass it up.  The purchase was well worth it.  The music sounds great and love the sound quality of amazon digital downloads.
I only bought because of price and as expected.. she might be the most over rated star in music history (besides Justin Bieber).Listen to Madonna. Listen to the depth she had.I am not even a huge Madonna fan but anybody can hear it. Just because you put some crazy clothes on does not make you a star.can she sing? Yes. is she creative? depends on taste but I will say yes.Does that make her a HUGE star? No
Lady Gaga is so misunderstood. She is very talented and this cd will prove that to you. Great listening for all.
You try so hard to like this CD because there is so much in there to love! But ultimately you accept that you don't want to play it any more. All the elements of greatness are there but not enough to weave them together in a way that feels musically unique and fun.PROS:Message is strong inspiring and brave. She has guts and is on the side of justice. The arrangements are complex layered and bring in musical cultural influences from all over the map. Lyrics are fun clever and artistic. She can play the piano and sing to beat the band.CONS:But while this record might work as the set list for a mega-show in a mega-arena it manages to overwhelm itself within a few minutes on CD and get really boring in a hurry. Suddenly you find yourself listening to all the other sounds you hate from people who came before Lady Gaga but were not nearly as original revolutionary or talented. The rhythms and melodies start to lose their identity and in the process you lose interest because it feels like you're listening to a smash-up of 80s top hits all crunched into one heavy track after another that has got everything in it including the kitchen sink.CONCLUSION: The songs get weighted down not lifted up and that special je ne se quais that makes Lady Gaga phenomenal is lost in the jumble of mega production around melodies that aren't strong enough to keep the core robust. Like there is no air to breathe and the muscle and effort in this one CD could have expressed itself better in five albums not one. Or at least it would have been more fun to listen to. But this CD seems to choke itself out pretty fast and once the air leaves the room the party's dull.
I love Lady Gaga and love almost every song on this CD. My cockatiel especially loves Edge of Glory. She dances her little heart out everytime the song is on! (Seriously!)
"I bought my copy at 3:00am this morning and was able to download all 14 tracks.  The strange thing was I never got the digital booklet! Which seems to be the *opposite* problem that people are experiencing now.  Anyways I don't care much about not having the booklet so onto the album review...This is the first complete Gaga album I've purchased so this is interpreted by a person who has only heard previous singles ""Just Dance"" ""Poker Face"" ""Lovegame"" ""The Fame"" ""Bad Romance"" ""Telephone"" and ""Alejandro"".  I really enjoy Born This Way!  Just about every song is geared for the dance floor and like with her first album I can see many successful singles being launched from this album.  The production/instrumentation seems a bit ""heavier"" than her previous albums but that's certainly not a bad thing.  Lyrically she is sending a message to be yourself and do whatever you wish regardless of criticism from others.  For example ""I'm as free as my hair"" are the chorus lyrics to Hair.  Each song has a tiny message of individuality and freedom attached to it.Now I wish I could be one of those people to look deep into the meanings of each song but I'm not.  But if you enjoy dance music with a positive message there's pretty much no reason not to enjoy this release.  And please stop complaining about your downloads because I've been using AmazonMp3 since their launch in September 2007 and they WILL help to resolve your issue.  But it may take some time to issue a re-download for people considering their servers are currently overloaded from download requests for this album."
This album was far by the best she's had! Has catchy tunes to it and the songs get stuck in your head. It was worth buying it!
I've been a Gaga fan since she put out the Fame. I thought that the Fame was quite pop-ish and the songs were very catchy. When the Fame Monster came out my likeness towards Gaga became true love. The Fame Monster was a pop album and so much more- very unique and she really showed off her musical talent. For the past year I've been very excited for Born this Way to release and I was sure that it would be even better than the Fame Monster.Boy was I wrong. Born this Way has two good songs- 'Born this Way' and 'Judas.' That's it. 'The Edge of Glory' sounds like a song that Journey would have done 30 years ago. I hate that song. The worst song on the album is 'You and I.' It sounds like a song meant for Taylor Swift or some other pop country singer. It's very droning.Also not to offend anyone- but Gaga's constant referencing of Christianity Jesus Christ and God in this album is a little over the top. She sings about these things in almost every song on the album.After I listened to the album for a while all of the songs started to sound the same. There are so many fillers that don't contain any kind of musical genius that I thought for sure Lady Gaga had before I listened to this album. Born this Way just seems to be a rushed compilation of music. I feel as though any other pop star could have put this exact same album out and it would be acceptable. People such as Katy Perry or Britney Spears could put this crap out and I wouldn't think twice about it. But this is unacceptable work for Lady Gaga. I'm really dissapointed.
Lady GaGa's latest and greatest CD is filling my earsAnd lifting my heart while I dance dance dance.The rumor mill is buzzing day and nightOver a girl with a pearl's eye full of talent.Beginning this fantastic CD with Marry The NightGot me hooked and before a moment the CD was over.Born this way is the greatest CD released in years.There are so many artists that I respect and love their musicBut Lady GaGa's got the balls to say what she wantsAnd she wants everyone to be respected for who they are.Born This Way surrounds you with uplifting music and smart lyrics.For those who gave it one star try to really listen.For those who gave it 5 stars I'm thrilled she got you.
I love Lady Gaga's new album Born This Way all of her new songs are awesome! She's the new queen of pop. It's fun to dance to also. Lady Gaga changed pop music forever. I think the recycled manufactured pop junk fad is out of style now. hehe... Most of Lady Gaga's songs are about being meaningful (which is pretty cool).1) Marry The Night 10/102) Born This Way 10/103) Government Hooker 10/104) Judas 10/105) Americano 10/106) Hair 10/107) ScheiBe 10/108) Bloody Mary 10/109) Black Jesus + Amen Fashion 10/1010) Bad Kids 10/1011) Fashion of His Love 10/1012) Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) 10/1013) Heavy Metal Lover 10/1014) Electric Chapel 10/1015) The Queen 10/1016) You & I 10/1017) The Edge of Glory 10/10Disc 2:Born This Way (Country Road Version) 10/10Judas (DJ White Shadow Remix) 10/10Marry the Night (Zedd Remix) 10/10ScheiBe (DJ White Shadow Mugler) 10/10Fashion of His Love (Fernando Garibay Remix) 10/10Born This Way is the best album in 2011. This album changed my life completely. Her music reminds me of Bruce Springsteen Whitney Houstan Madonna and Queen. I did enjoy the new album. :)
"By all accounts ""The Fame"" was the perfect debut album for a superstar. It had all kinds of dance music with crafty beats and tight production. When comparing Gaga's debut against those of Rihanna Katy Perry Pink Britney Spears Ke$ha and all her contemporaries Gaga's album was by far the best of the bunch. There had not been a true debut album by a female pop star that was so excellent probably dating back to Cyndi Lauper's ""She's So Unusual"" in 1983 which became the first female debut to ever spawn 5 singles in the top 10. And not since 1988 (Paula Abdul) has a female pop star had multiple number one singles on both the Hot 100 and the dance charts.So Gaga had much to live up to here and there is no way possible to please everybody. The attempt to do so can be heard in the overproduction which has WAY too much reverb and some of the tracks run too long. But the biggest problem is the quality of the songs. This is a clear example of what happens when an artist is given too much musical freedom too soon and the songwriters who wrote all of your earlier hits (RedOne) can't come up with songs quite as good the second time around. Witness the high-pitched screeches in ""Government Hooker"" in which after repeating the phrase ""I am your hooker"" over and over she yelps through autotune a long extended ""hoooooookaaahhhhhh."" And what happened to Gaga's tendency to be Avant-Garde? That has now been replaced with phrases like ""I'm as free as my hair"" and ""It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M."" As the album closes there is a country ballad (""You and I) which is a total clunker of a song and a horrible electro-pop track called ""Electric Chapel"" which is more reverb and auto-tune on a continuous loop.It will be interesting to watch sales for the album during it's second week. ""Edge of Glory"" dropped from #3 to #19 on the Billboard chart in one week; a week in which Gaga was on American Idol The View and SNL. Not since Michael Jackson's ""HiStory"" has a musical album release been this hyped. But unlike Jacko Gaga got weird too soon and does not have classic albums like ""Thriller"" and ""Bad"" to fall back on. She is starting to look more like a fading fascination each passing day. Serves her right for trying to ""reinvent"" herself before even really establishing herself. Ego will do that I guess."
... I also received only one song at first but it seems that I'm receiving the subsequent tracks as I listen.  Patience Monsters!  Just start listening and you'll get the whole album for the dollar.  What a great deal and hey I probably wouldn't have bought this album otherwise so good on ya Team Gaga.  Thank you!4 Stars for booty-shaking fun even if it's not really anything new.  Gaga's strength seems to be in her image not her music.  Hey whatever works and gets people to have fun.
"The self-proclaimed mother monster is back with her second (and a half) studio album where she takes on 80's power ballads and the retro dance genre. This 80's theme extends to the European techno vibe that took off during the same decade note 'Scheibe'. Even the umlaut in 'You and I' (can't replicate here) is mega 80's a la Motley Crue and Queensryche. The old drum machines and synthesizers are all here notably what sounds like a TR-808 cowbell and hand clap possibly the same electronic percussion for the I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Whitney Houston) sound alike track: 'Fashion of His Love'. The synthesizers in particular act as a conduit at times melding New Wave 80's with modern electronica. Born This Way commingles the sounds of a plethora of artists (Pat Benatar Queen Bruce Springsteen Madonna MJ and Journey) against a religious themed backdrop. In keeping with the themed album formula The Fame espoused shallow virtues like vanity notoriety wealth and power. The Fame's second incarnation The Fame: Monster was an appropriately darker more brooding piece as evidenced by melancholic lyrics and dissonance. Born This Way exhibits the full fledged evolution of an artist a markedly different sound compared to Lady Gaga's debut album which has split her current fan base. Love it or hate it Lady Gaga has attempted to break new ground and made some pretty outrageous claims like promising this would be the best album of the decade and certainly the best of her career. Judging by Amazon alone Born This Way has fueled either hard core loyalty or dissension but an overinflated ego won't earn her any new fans.There's a lot to love here including the title track and if you haven't heard it or seen the video by now you clearly live under a rock. The video leaves much to be desired and I was expecting something very different. Lady G wrote the script and brought some outside influences to aid with art direction and styling so it's a tough call as far as what's her vision and what's studio manufactured. I'm willing to bet it's a bit of both but the message of self-acceptance in the face of adversity is great and the song hits  high notes lyrically and melodically. The 'country road version' is also the only remix I've ever liked let alone tolerated so thanks again Gaga! As for the other remixes on the album they are mostly tailored for the dance/house/trance crowd many of whom are Gaga fans so that makes sense despite the fact that I really didn't like them. Finally I just don't get the Express Yourself comparison. I've heard both songs and they sound nothing alike although Gaga does copy Madge's style (make-up clothing etc) and sings similarly. 'Fashion of His Love' on the other hand while fantastic it really does sound exactly like I Wanna Dance With Somebody and I'm surprised that comparison hasn't been given nearly as much attention. 'Judas' is my favorite record on the album about being torn between two lovers one a backstabbing betrayer aka Judas and the other a quintessential good guy archetype aka Jesus while secretly seeking revenge. The video is as intriguing and evocative as the lyrics and both are replete with religious symbolism; a simply superb track. The late Clarence Clemons (RIP) of E-Street Band fame is featured on two stellar tracks 'Hair' (secretly hoped it would be a remake of the title Broadway musical hit) and 'The Edge of Glory'. Reportedly Clemons spoke very highly of Gaga prior to his death and was honored to be a part of the project.Additional tracks include 'Bad Kids' which lifts lyrics directly from the intro of MJ's They Don't Really Care About Us: ""We don't care what people say we know the truth!"". It should be noted that at the time Michael Jackson wrote that lyric he was dealing with some pretty dire legal troubles so the line itself rings rather hollow in an obnoxious tune about being a degenerate and thumbing your nose at anyone who takes offense. 'You and I' however is highly underrated and has some serious potential as a single. The ballad follows the same vein as Speechless with throaty vocals piano and a stomp-stomp-clap rhythm akin to Def Leppard/Queen. 'Marry the Night' is another solid track about living/loving the night life basically unabashedly enjoying yourself accented by a pulse pounding upbeat tempo with soaring vocals.However no one is perfect not even Lady Gaga (although she is trying to convince us otherwise). 'Americano' is basically Alejandro 2.0 so if you loved The Fame: Monster's incarnation you will love this as well and if you didn't then you and I are in the same boat. I had heard a lot of good things about 'Heavy Metal Lover' including infamous lyrics like ""I want your whiskey mouth all over my blonde south"" and ""Dirty pony I can't wait to hose you down"". Really the song comes across as an amalgamation of sounds culminating in noise under the guise of 'experimental'; 'Scheibe' suffers this same fate I'm afraid. Both songs try way too hard to be 'different' and 'edgy' but just sound confused: vocal distortion auto-tune overwrought bass beats dissonant synths and infantile lyrics...yuck. You could actually add 'Government Hooker' to this pig pile since those criticisms fit this track almost to a T. The intro is nice enough and features a glittery almost operatic Gaga mezzo-soprano but after several seconds the beat starts and woof! the magic dissipates as soon as it began. I was desperately searching for something subversive or at the very least introspective but alas ""Put your hands on me John F Kennedy/I'll make you squeal baby as long as you pay me"" is as close as she gets. It's astonishing that Lady Gaga can produce an album (mostly of her own design) that features such dichotomy. That's probably why I can only give this four out of five stars.This album was not a complete let down but I will expect better in the future. Overall I enjoyed most of it and some of the bonus tracks were worth it (excluding the remixes). I'd recommend the album although so far her best work has been The Fame: Monster in my opinion. Many out there (apparently on Amazon among other places) still regard Lady G as a passable annoyance but her live performances set her apart form any other and I would direct doubters to YouTube which is where I learned to love this wunderkind misfit from NY. Beautiful vocals and a knack for writing great hooks and melodies our mother monster isn't going anywhere anytime soon. In the words of Clarence Clemons ""She's the real deal. All the craziness and stuff there's a purpose to all of it. She has no boundaries...."""
This is not a review of Lady Gaga's music as much as how impressed I am with Amazon's new MP3 Cloud service.  True I was drawn to Lady Gaga's music after seeing and hearing her on a recent American Idol show.  OK I paid my $.99 for the full album and within 1 minute it was loaded to my Amazon Cloud service. I am playing the album righ now on my Droid X plus my storage was upgraded from 5GB to 20GB for this one purchase.  Oh yes I can download the full album to my desktop computer when I get home.  Needless to say this is one heck of a service!  I should also note at the same time I am beta testing Google's new music cloud service and I would say that Google's product is more like pre-Alpha when attempting to play songs loaded to their cloud service on an Android phone or tablet  --- Only available to view from the browser; as soon as the browser screen goes black or you open a new browser tab on the Google service all music stops. They desperately need an Android App similar to Amazon's.  Enough said. Go Amazon!
"I decided to download this album when it was on sale for $0.99.  I really don't purchase this kind of music too much because I am mainly into rock music.  However I listen to the radio a lot and liked a few of her past singles (Just Dance Bad Romance Love Game).  I liked the song ""Judas"" when I first heard it and bought the single.  I decided to give the album a chance because hey it was only $0.99 so why not.  But if it weren't for that sale I wouldn't have purchased this.  I'm just a casual fan of some of her songs.  ""Judas"" and ""Born This Way"" are good tracks.  I also think ""Edge of Glory"" is one of her best and strongest songs.  However I can't get into this album.  I listened to it a few times and there are no other tracks besides the three singles ""Marry The Night"" and ""Schiebe"" that are really that good.  ""Schiebe"" being my favorite with the thumping beats cool vocals and catchy chorus.  For casual listeners to Gaga like myself I suggest you go with those 5 tracks.  Other than that you are going to get an album where a lot of the songs run into one another and don't really stand out.  It is much techno-y than her previous hits I can tell.  Anyways just wanted to write my honest opinion."
I like some of the songs and I can't say anything about the album sucks....just not nearly as good as her debut recording. Sorry babe.
"MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF HERS TO DATE YET!!! I'm a huge fan of her music & was expecting greatness but i honestly wasn't sure how she could find a way to TOP her ""Bad Romance"" Era. I love that she can sing/write WHATEVER her heart desires & the ""britney-clone"" making machine pop industry seems to have not affected her style in any way. I am SO tired of hearing the same generic crap EVERYTIME i turn on the radio by britney kesha other industry sluts that only made it on the airways because of AUTO-TUNE. I love that her music is so distinctive...you can just listen to the first 5 seconds of a song (without hearing her voice) & know that it's one of her songs. I love all of her songs on this album ESPECIALLY ""Black Jesus  Amen Fashion""...it's infectious makes me want to strut around my house like a runway! (Maybe sometimes I do!)..LOL!!!!! my paws are up for my Mother-Monster! '"
The 4 stars are for all of Lady Gaga's singles thus far which I like which I realize may not be helpful straight off but I just wanted to write quickly to let you all know I was having the same problem too with the album download [only actually seeing the booklet and not being able to click on or play any of the tracks in cloudplayer]. I was getting ready to contact customer service but when I went to check for my order number I saw that the album is still being processed so PLEASE before we end up w/200 negative reviews check your orders in your amazon account and make sure your order has actually COMPLETED before you get all fired up! :)
Album is not worth it and Amazon makes the download frustrating and lengthy. I'm sticking to iTunes.This should be seamless but it isn't. I was disappointed in the delivery. I wish she made a deal with Apple instead since they can handle the volume.
I use Amazon MP3 all the time on both my Droid and my laptop and have never experienced an issue until today. Gaga is the biggest act in the world right now and so offering up her album for under a buck is of course going to lead to server overload. But the album is well worth the wait it saved me time waiting on it to deliver in the mail or dragging my butt out to Best Buy to get it. I guess all those complaining have never waited in line for anything and can't deal oh well.p.s. At this point i only have 2 songs downloaded from this purchase(and I already had BTW and Judas as singles) but have heard the whole album. Love it.
"I've been waiting nearly two hours and have not even been able to download one single song.  Every download attempt fails and when I retry it ""waits"" forever and fails again.  I know this album is good because I've heard cuts from it but I sure as hell won't ever buy it from Amazon!  I'll go back to my original method of saving individual mp3s to my desktop...too bad for Lady Gaga that she ends up with lousy ratings because you have rotten tech help...the rating I gave WOULD have been a five but the aggravation lowered it by half"
I had loved every song on every album she has put out this far and I still do!! GaGa just keeps getting better and better and is still able to throw some surprises and shocks in there as well and this is why she is the number one pop star in the world. I've had this album since it came out and I still listen to it all the way through at least once a day. Every song on this album is different not one is the same as the last and that's why it never gets old. It's a more mature sound for GaGa and not as popish as The Fame but this album should make her die hard fans happy as well as get her ALLOT of new ones. Mother Monster!
I'd read about people having numerous problems with the down load I just downloaded mine in under 90 seconds.  Even if it would have taken longer it would have been worth it for 99 cents (Using Mac OSX and the Latest edition of Safari)
I purchased this last night. I was charged for it but it didn't download. I've tried to go back through the steps but it doesn't show at all on cloud 9. Very frustrated!!!
"When releasing an album in today's market (especially in an age where iTunes/Rhapsody/Amazon make up bulk sales & piracy can diminish numbers proper marketing and strategy is EVERYTHING. Even when a singer or an album's material seems like gold if the material isn't properly released it can make a large difference between massive success and underperforming flops. Take the current talk of the town Adele. Sure her album is amazing and she's been winning awards left and right but take into consideration how different her level of success would be had Rolling In The Deep not been released or music videos weren't being put out? Since that's the song that largely propelled her into worldwide acclaim it could have kept her just under the radar. Such is the case with Lady Gaga's ""Born This Way"". Let's point out the right moves that were made.--Born this Way being released as the first single & also being massively promoted on iTunes/youtube months before the album's release [Hype = word of mouth=imminent success]-- Fantastic music videos [Keeps the song fresh in your mind & tends to keep a single's success afloat for weeks]--diverse television performances of album material directed at different audiences [Any live performances are a great opportunity to prove your vocal chops and/or visual appeal]-- amazon's 99c deal [This has been compared to basically saying the album was nearly a giveaway but what better way to grab a new audience than by letting them hear your material for next to nothing?]All the above factors contributed to Gaga's incredible 1.1 million opening week sales & allowed her to go [as of 2/28/12]  8x platinum worldwide in less than a year.  However not every decision an artist makes is for the best and can sometimes set them back instead of allowing them to prosper; for this album here were some of these moments:--releasing Judas as a single when other songs had better radio/video/sales appeal (Americano Hair Schiesse Fashion of His Love)--amazon's 99c deal (both a blessing and a curse)...while effective for reasons above it also diminishes the value of her work in some people's perspective and makes it appear as if she isn't capable of maintaining an audience without giveaways--placing too much material on one album .... while I liked most of the material 17 songs & 5 remixes on one album is serious overkill save some for a later release or a ""unreleased/b-sides"" album. Makes the album appear cluttered & messy. Less is always more.This is just my opinion from a music label perspective of how if the album had been better managed it might have sold much better. I am a large Gaga fan and love the album but I'd figured i'd add some insight. Let me know what you think!"
"Lady Gaga is in a lovefest with Lady Gaga. That was apparent before listeners even got a chance to hear ""Born This Way"" as the singer claimed that the album was going to be superior to Michael Jackson's ""Thriller."" In reality this music is just okay with most of the songs combining retro melodies with futuristic beats mixing in the occasional hook. But the big difference is the focus on this album is on image and self-promotion; Lady Gaga is nothing more than a manufactured moneymaker for the industry and that is apparent by all the professionals who worked on this album. They even trotted out oldfolks Mutt Lange and the guitar player from Queen to enhance the songs.The lyrics are just plain dumb both banal and self-absorbed. Gaga herself seems to think that sheer will power will put her atop the charts when in fact her singles from the album so far have not met sales expectations. Some of the songs are constructed well while others sound like lame 1980's soundtrack material that could have been sung by Vixen Lita Ford or Pat Benatar. And that's not a knock on Pat Benatar by any means. But it does giv one pause when an artist like Gaga who has not released a good single since ""Bad Romance"" professes to be so inventive and original. If the definition of inventive is to channel your inner 1980's Madonna and Pat Benatar then that's a problem because the songs just aren't that good anyways."
OK here's my two cents on this CD.  Please no negative responses to this we are all entitled to our opinions. If it doesn't float your boat I understand.  Music is very subjective it either moves you or it doesn't.  Though my first love is contemporary country music I've always been proud of the fact that I listen/buy music that is pleasing to my ear and venture beyond my comfort zone.  So with that I will see what's out there besides country so that I don't limit myself.  I was interested in this gal the moment I heard her.  I too was skeptical that I would like all her songs but couldn't turn down an outstanding sale this Black Friday.  Well I have been listening to this CD for the last three hours just bopping in my seat and loving every second of this.  I won't go into my analysis of every song but this is great CD to shake your body to clean your house toor exercise to.  She's a music and marketing genius...my hat's off to her.  This is really good folks if you are on the fence it is definitely worth your hard earned money.  Again just my opinion.
Is this some kind of Amazon scam or something???I can only play and download 1 song (even though I bought entire album)!!!I bought it for a second time and only 4 songs are playable!!!I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!
What a great voice! I had blown her off as another singer that needed a gimmick to sell her mediocre music. I was wrong Gaga can sing and on this album she gives as good as any before her.
Thank you very much for the 099 $-deal!!!It was totally worth it! Okay the 'Fame Monster' may be waay better than 'Born This Way' but seriously you coulnd't do anything wrong with this deal!My favorites:Americano Judas Born this Way The Edge of Glory Highway Unicorn and Schei&szlig;e!!
"I don't consider myself a Lady Gaga fan in any way but I do think ""Poker Face"" and ""Telephone"" are pretty catchy and I think she's a self-marketing genius. (And maybe that makes me a little envious.) This 99-cent album release is another smart move. I generally go for heavy rock but I do have a decent-sized collection of dance and house music. Surprisingly (to me; probably not to anyone else) this album fits right in with what I like. It might not (OK it probably won't) turn me into a little monster but at least I'll have something new and tasty to listen to and for 99 cents how could I go wrong?"

pretty disappointed actually. the previous album is way better&#8230; only like one or two songs on this album and it's not even that good&#8230; i'm not sure why i bought it -_-
GaGa has a lot to live up to.  Poker Face and Bad Romance are once in a lifetime songs.  Born This Way the single comes very close.  If you expect every song to be like those you will likely be disappointed. But once you listen to this album several times you realize the new direction she has taken.  Her hallmark dance beats and in-your face lyrics are influenced this time by the 80s.  Hence why people thought Madonna's Express Yourself sounded like Born This Way.  They share an arrangement style--though it's far from the same melody.  GaGa also has more between the lines under her usual in your face.  For example Government Hooker is really about JFK and Marilyn but it takes some a while to figure that out.  As the album progresses her sound becomes increasing influenced by the 80s.  She even throws in some county influenced arrangements (You and I) and if you bought the deluxe edition a country-influenced Born This Way.  I like the whole album but if I'm pressed for time I favor the following: Marry the Night Born This Way Judas Government Hooker Hair SheiseThe Edge of Glory Highway Unicorn and Americano.  If I lhave a little more time well i just play as many as I can. It just grows on you.  For example at first I thought Hair was silly but now it is one of my absolute favorites.  Yes I want to be as free as my hair.  When you have big hair it's easy to understand what she means.  Love her.

While liking Fame...and Fame Monster I didn't really like Born This Way. In a way it is kind of like a movie one of those movies where the best parts are shown on the commercial and after you see it you really don't actually like it. Well that is kinda what Born This Way is like...all of the good songs(Judas Born This Way Edge of Glory) are played on the radio..and the bad songs are left on the album. But...it was only 99 cents. Anyway I say meh.
Well no offense to the album I think its great and the deal on this is awesome but this review is mainly focused on Amazon.After several agonizing hours of waiting I've received nothing. Not even a song or the booklet. Now I've bought several albums and songs off Amazon but this is just ridiculous.Another thing about amazon is the inability to download your music else where unless its on the cloud player crap. I mean what if you wanted to download your purchases on to another device or what happens when your hard drive is wiped clean and there is no stored data of any of the purchases that you've made.Amazon should revamp their system in order to make their faithful customers re-download their songs where and whenever they choose. Not every one can spend the money to purchase the same item again just to obtain what they already have.
This CD has 17 songs and I love 15 of them.  That's a heck of a lot of songs.  This CD is well worth the money.
I'm going through a religious experience with this album. Every song is beautifully written and composed. HAIR takes me back to when I was growing up and fighting my parents against trying to express myself. Currently BLOODY MARY is on repeat in my car it makes me want to sip wine and smoke cigars on the roof top of sky scrapper in NYC waving my arms above my head. I strongly suggest purchasing the deluxe cd so that you can hear BORN THIS WAY the counrty road version... Fanstastic!
I really like what I have heard so far. I am having issues with the Amazon Cloud Player like many others are but that is an issue unrelated to the actual product.Overall really loving the songs. Especially Government Hooker and Bloody Mary.
I love Gaga.  She is amazing unique and really relatable to me and I absolutely love this album.  I wasn't sure about Judas or Born this Way at first but Judas has grown to be one of my all time favorite songs.  Government Hooker is amazing hands down.  She is so creative and crazy that her music just takes me to another world.  I have honestly been listening to this album everyday in my car since the day it has come out.  Bloody Mary is insane I am in love with it.  Heavy Metal Lover amazing.  Americano is so catchy and unlike anything out there today.  Not a huge fan of Hair because it is a little depressing but also relatable to many.  You and I is the only song I can't stand.  I have deleted it off my itunes and change it every time it comes on the radio.  It is really the only Gaga song I can say that I hate.  It just isn't like her and I just can never get into it.  Electric Chapel is amazing.  Marry the Night is the perfect way to start off the album.  It gives her whole life story in the video and I can really feel the emotion and depth in the song when I listen to it.  Absolutely love it.  One of my favorite albums of all time.  Gaga is amazing and one of the best entertainers of all times.  Can't wait to see what she comes up with yet.  I feel that she is the voice of so many people and that she really stands up for those who are misunderstood.  Love her so much!  Gotta love anyone who dares to  be different.
"I'll preface this review by saying that this is the first Lady Gaga album I purchased.  I've followed her singles releases with some interest; this is rare as I don't care much for modern pop/dance music.  But Lady Gaga's songs had a spark of originality a creative passion that was intoxicating.I'd heard both ""Born This Way"" and ""Judas"" before purchasing this album.  Both songs are enjoyable though the title track's up-front message kind of undermines its honesty; there's a lot to be said for subtlety.  Which granted isn't exactly a trait we associate with Lady Gaga.  Still the majority of the songs on this album are forgettable--they blend into the milieu of pop/dance music.  Even when she reaches for something new and original we end up underwhelmed: there's supposed to be deeper meaning in the phrase ""I am my hair"" but for the life of me I don't associate philosophy with highlights.Not to say there aren't a few standouts.  ""Marry the Night"" is almost operatic.  ""ScheiBe"" is interesting if only because I like hearing people rap in languages they can't speak.  ""Bloody Mary"" is a slow-burning gem easily one of the best here; think of all the connotations of the phrase ""Bloody Mary"" (religious historical alcoholic) and combine them together.  ""Bad Kids"" is kind of nice if not mind-blowing.  My personal favorite would have to be ""You and I"" the Gaga self-penned tribute to both Nebraska and power ballads.  It's perhaps the one song on here where she doesn't try to hard and just lets the music take her where it wants.This isn't to say that BORN THIS WAY is without merits.  It's a catchy pop album; note the three stars.  But it's not as creatively brilliant as some of her earlier stuff.  Nor honestly as danceable or memorable.  It's Gaga watered down which is still worth a listen or two."
"Its an amazing album but Amazon beeps out the ""bad words""Besides that fact I freakin love gaga and this album is so different."
Born This Way by far is Lady Gaga's best album to date. This album makes me feel free and confident.
I purchased this album but only downloaded 5 songs! What's going on Amazon? This is probably the biggest album in the last year - and you screw up digital delivery? Come on!That said this album is EPIC. A must have!!
This album is an absolute masterpiece! A nice blend of pop rock electro hair metal dance and a hint of jazz and country. I don't think it will appeal to the majority of fans/casual fans as it will to the 'monsters' heck I think there's a few monsters who wanted another 'Just Dance' or 'Poker Face' but this is a huge step up from 2008's 'The Fame'. I'm glad this album is a bit more dark and heavy and love the 80's/90's throwbacks too. I've always wanted Gaga's pop-rock side to come out since 'Blueberry Kisses' 'Electric Kiss 'Fever' and 'Red & Blue' (pre Gaga days) so this makes me even more than happy! Love this album it's more than I could have wanted from Gaga. I think she outdid herself and glad it's nothing like the sounds of her contemporaries ;) Job well done Lady Gaga.Album highlights: Government Hooker Hair Schei&szlig;e Bloody Mary Fashion of His Love Heavy Metal Lover Electric Chapel Yo&uuml; and I and The Edge of Glory.
Luckily it only cost me $0.99 to realize Amazon MP3 offers subpar quality compared to the iTunes Store. Only 2 items from this album downloaded and the sound quality is terrible! Back to iTunes for me.
I downloaded this album about 20 minutes or so ago and only 8 songs are available for download. These songs should be available instantly and its frustrating that i have payed for these songs and i'm not getting them. however i've seen im not the only person with this problem so im hoping it will be fixed.
Yep I said it..My dad loves this CD. He and I both enjoy Lady Gaga I wasn't sure what to expect with it being a new CD..But her music is simply wonderful..It's fun and gets you moving. BUY IT
This is a good album.  She is a very creative artist and I just love jamming to her music anytime
"Amazon should've known better and anticipated the download volume when they decided to offer up a mainstream popstar's new album for a buck.  I know the company is trying to get a leg up in the so-called ""Cloud Wars"" but this experience has turned me off entirely to Amazon mp3s.  I'd rather just pay full price on iTunes and avoid the hassle."
I really only like 3 of the songs on this album.  Her first album still remains the best one.
"Lady GaGa continues her torrid domination of the music industry with her new album Born This Way. Her trademark style and uniqueness shines through with hits like ""Born This Way"" ""The Edge of Glory"" and ""Government Hooker."" Although the album songs are solid and catchy there seems to be a dropoff not having that oomph and risk-taking that was present in her previous albums.Still a wonderful album great for the car working out and just listening any time."
"It's curious that although Lady GaGa's music appeals to a demographically eclectic fanbase the artist's little monsters are almost singularly relegated to the queer and the outcast.  When the titular single debuted it seemed an inevitability that the album would become a love letter to these little monsters.  Yet in pandering to this small but rabid subset of her fans GaGa ultimately alienates a majority of her listeners gay and straight.  The lyric is disingenuous as GaGa hijacks and simplifies the gay identity into what is intended as the quintessential LGBT anthem.  The musical production comes off just as half-baked as the single amounts to a dizzying melange of sounds that throw in everything from brash gospel claps to busy techno beats.  This seemed to be an album that would shift the locus of GaGa's music from casual listeners who simply wanted to hear creative pop music to little monsters who yearned for an artist that understood their social plights.  Thankfully any worry that Lady GaGa would forgo musical ambition for a larger social purpose is largely unrealized.Lady GaGa has developed a sound that expertly combines genres ranging from disco to opera techno to heavy metal jazz to gospel.  On the album GaGa's greatest triumph lies in her ability to twist this musical pastiche into a sound that is purely pop.  In ""Scheisse"" she smartly balances a lyric about the unaccomplished goals of the feminism movement with the futuristic sounds of techno.  ""Heavy Metal Lover"" provides a head banging dance number by stripping down GaGa's voice and focusing on Garibay's lavish production.  And she modernizes the stomping rock of Queen with a contemporary electronic synth in ""You and I.""  It is in these moments that the album is a success that Lady GaGa recontextualizes music from the past to rejuvenate the been-there-done-that sound of today's pop.Yes there are moments where the music is hurried and ultimately unsure of itself.  RedOne's production of ""Judas"" sounds disjointed from the religious imagery that the lyrics evoke and ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)"" is unable to decide whether it wants to be a towering rock opera or an indulgent club song.  But these moments are thankfully never as brazen or duplicitous as the leading single.  Amidst all the critical noise that she is simply copycatting better pop artists Lady GaGa has crafted a genre-bending album that is more consistently rewarding than ""The Fame.""  And her ability to combine music of the past with that of today should quell any fears that Lady GaGa's sound will cease to be as inclusive as the actual audience that listens to her music."
This entire album moves. I have trouble picking a favorite song because they are all so amazing. The music has power and meaning. Give it a few listens and it'll grab onto your heart and will never let go.
"I have heard Lady GaGa sing & as voices go her's is not bad-my problem is thisshe calls her album ""Born Like This"" wanting us to believe this is who she is yetshe has flt out admitted her persona is a gimmick.she does outlandish thingswrites songs about controversial issues she herself probably does not believe.i enjoy singers that just singif it's political or emotional fineall the better but don't lie to medon't try to sell me a persona or a gimmick and surewe don't get every piece of the artist that's too much but we get enough that we know they're real.Lady GaGa came accross as a cardboard cutout on David Letterman the other night-she's not real folksshe's a gimmicka one trick pony i'd be surprised if anyone even remembers her name ten years from now & if we do it'll be another gimmicklike flying out of her gal-pal Madonnas butt dressed as the Cookie Monster! nobody wants to see thatnobody."
This girl is hotter than a fire cracker Might be the next big thing. Might rate it for older kids.
Is there an explicit version or only a clean version (a beep replace an f word in the song Government hooker)..... ?I kinda liked the CD everything sounds the same but I kinda enjoyed it!Not as great as The Fame Monster....
I was very unfamiliar with lady Gaga's music until this album arrived.  But hearing samples of the tracts on facebook while playing Farmville made me a fan.  I was blown away with the range and quality of her voice the total polished professional sound of her music.  While I can't claim to be a big fan of some of the lyrics I would listen to her sing anything.  This recording shows such dynamic range.  While she presents herself as a visual performer. her musical abilities and talents are quite remarkable.
Amazon has worked this out because the whole album downloaded in about 15 minutes. Just with the ease of the download and the price this gets 5 stars.I've given the album a quick listen. Gaga's stuff isn't the type of music I generally listen to. I mostly stick to hard rock and metal. But I love Gaga and a few of her other songs so I figured I would give this a try. And I think the album has some promise. Electric Chapel for example is a rock song with a bit of techno vibe. It's got a good guitar riff and a nice little solo.That song stuck out to me because its more my bread and butter. Bad Kids has a more rock feel too. The other stuff is more along the lines of her other music though still different from her other albums.I didn't expect to love this album on first listen. It takes me a while to warm up to music from bands that I absolutely love. But considering the price the fact that I love Gaga and the promise I think it has from the first listen I think this is a great deal.
I could do without two of the songs but this CD rocks!  If you love the 80s you will love this CD.  My 9 year old daughter loves it but again read the lyrics before you let them have the whole thing.
Not sure if I just got lucky or if Amazon has fixed its issues but I purchased the full CD for 99 cents about 20 minutes ago and they are all working perfectly on my Cloud drive right now. Might have been quicker than that; this was the first time I checked for a status update and found all songs working great. Don't hesitate to grab this great deal!
I'm only able to access 5 songs for 99 cents still a good deal. bad on Amazon.com for this issue.
What is wrong with some of you? This is an incredible deal a fun album and a great experiment. Rating this poorly ONLY reflects on you. Here we have Amazon trying to give you something cool and because you can't wait a few moments you get pissy? Yet some of you same people are willing to stand in an iPhone line for a few days (you know who you are).
this is a great album lady gaga does it again. she has really came up into the world. her music is entertaing and has good beats. the best songs on this cd aretrack list2. born this way3. government hooker5. americano7. scheibe8. bloody mary12. eletric chapleif you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
This album is the best of 2011 and very well could be the best of all time the different styles of each song sets this album apart from all the others. This album is for sure worth buying.
excellent album. i love the song. it is  very creative. gaga is reaaly an artist. gaga you are the best. keep doing what you re doing.
It may not be the music for me even after seeing her on the season closing episode of SNL but my wife loves it.
I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS CD.THERE ARE SEVERAL AMAZING  SONGS ON THE DISC - BORN THIS WAY YOU AND I EDGE OF GLORY HAIR MARRY THE NIGHT AND JUDAS.  IF THOSE SONGS WERE RELEASED AS AN EP IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A FITTING FOLLOWUP TO THE FAME CDS.  HOWEVER THE DISC IS PACKED WITH FILLER SONGS THAT DRAG EVERYTHING DOWN TO A MEDIOCRE AND REDUNDANT BORE.  I EXPECTED MORE FROM MISS GAGA.I'M BEGINNING TO FEAR GAGA WILL NOT GO THE DISTANCE.  IS CELEBRITY APPRENTICE IN HER FUTURE?
I love love love love this album.  This is one of those rare albums you can actually play it from start to finish and never need to skip a track.
Disappointment that the version I got was censored and there was no indication that it would be censored and I can't seem to find a non censored version.
Okay it's not fair to rate an album 1 star because of Amazon.  However since I can't download my purchase...again I'll have to assume the album is a stinker.  Amazon MP3 service is totally useless on a Mac.  The downloader rarely works.  I'll chalk this purchase up to another reminder to not buy from Amazon MP3.  The rest of Amazon is great but the music service is a huge FAIL.
To all the haters: Whether or not you like it. You taking the time to write something negative that you didn't have to buy NOR listen too. Is very sad get a life. Also this album is going Diamond so I'm not worried.
I absolutley love Gaga and this album! But there is one small problem. A few of the songs are edited to bleep out curse words. Nowhere does it say that the album is edited so I was extremly dissapointed to turn it on and hear beeps!!! So buyer beware!!!!
Lady Gaga used to be okay with Poker Face Just Dance Telephone etc. back in the day.  This album is just horrible.  She's trying too hard and it shows.
Was expecting something different. Whats with all the preachy Jesus stuff? Some of the songs are annoying and don't really go anywhere. Saying random words because they rhymed over disjointed beats isn't much fun in my books.
my purchase won't download and because there is so much trouble with it  I am afraid I am being charged twice since I clicked on it to try to rectify the situation. The album sounds good but that is only from the preview and I don't know how to contact amazon  digital to fix this and I understand this isn't the right place for this but I didn't know how else to  deal with this situation
This song needs to be sung in every school in the country. Each student will be identify with the song in his/her own way.
I just brought this album and I can't seem to access any of the the music except Highway Lover. I will be hightly disappointed if I can't get the rest of my music. This seems like a good deal but I would hate for anyone else to have to go through a hassle to get their music!!
I saw another reviewer stated that Government Hooker was edited on this version. I have the deluxe and it's edited as well. I would think it was intentional to avoid a parental advisory sticker. It does annoy me a bit but what can you do. Overall it's a great album and definitely a no brainer for 99 cents!
It was of great sound and easy to download and use it has brought 100s of hours of great listening and when I do buy more music it will be from Amazon.com
Great test of Amazon's new cloud service... unfortunately at Lady Gaga's expense.  The music is great.  Go ahead and download and be patient while Amazon fixes the downloads.  99 cents for an album of any quality is amazing... for Born this Way it's the deal of the century so I can forgive Amazon for not being able to enjoy it all right away.  Worth waiting for!
"Marry The Night - Great way to start things off. This should've easily been a single released as I could totally imagine it being played at nightclub venues. Why Judas was released and not this is mind boggling.Bloody Mary - I really enjoyed the melody of this.Bad Kids - Really catchy song.Highway Unicorn - My favorite song on the CD because it has everything you need to know about Lady Gaga.Heavy Mental Lover - I know some people don't like this song but it has a calming effect to me for some reason whenever I get pissed off so I like to drive around while playing it because I won't be angry anymore.Electric Chapel - I love the pace of this.You & I - feels like a throwback to her previous songs of Again Again Brown Eyes and Speechless where she let her vocals and the lyrics speak for themselves rather relying on a catchy beat like most artists tend to do. I could really feel her soul in this. To me this song was Vintage Gaga.The Edge of Glory - Its the final song on the album and fittingly so and as it truly feels like her curtain call track. She could give up right now on making music and it would be a great way to end her career on much like how ""Let It Be"" was for the Beatles but what really sold me on the song was the use of the saxophone. I'm a huge fan of jazz and I went absolutely nuts the first time I heard it play. Its a seriously underrated music genre and I hope there will more jazz fans now thanks to Gaga's influence.The other half of the songs I omitted I couldn't get into either felt like filler had awful beats or lyrics or I feel like Lady Gaga phoned some of them in. I was hoping Born This Way would be as good as her last two albums. Unfortunately I can't help but feel disappointed by the third act of the Gaga trilogy."
I can honestly say that this is some of Gaga's finest work.  It takes a lot of courage to explore your creativity and she does it with flying colors.  From club thumping dance tracks to rock sessions thbit is album has something for everyone.  If you are a little stuck in your music ways it may take some time to enjoy these tracks but trust me you'll be hooked I'm certain.
Thanks for stealing my $1 amazon. I downloaded this and didn't get any songs. I wish I would have read the reviews first because it seems everyone is having the same problem.
"I must say I had extremely high expectations for this album with GaGa saying things like ""this is the best music I've written""  the anticipation nearly killed me. When I first heard the album she  blew my expectations out of the water! This is the single most amazing album I've heard in my life. It has everything great influential and/or positive messages along with enormous metaphoric inspiration. Not to mention the amazing musical aspect. The album is like an electronic journey through which you can learn so much about GaGa and yourself! I'd highly recommend this to anyone."
I couldn't sit through one entire song - I'd get bored and skip to the next song.  Thankfully I didn't waste more than 99 cents on this.
While Lady Gaga is OK this album is just overproduced disco/dance.  Nothing wrong with that but it seems like a waste of talent.  That is all.
after hearing born this way 10000 times I thought it was pretty catchy and this cd might be worth checking out. I had a $1 credit to my amazon account and the cd was on sale for .99 and I figured it was a no-brainer. I was disappointed in the cd. I thought the only really good song was born this way and the rest were not ipod worthy. I guess I cant complain though since I actually didnt even pay for it.
Talented and always entertaining music.  She is a huge success.  Music makes you feel good and want to dance.  Born this way is very good album
I love this CD and the album cover art is very cool on the Special Edition. Personally I don't listen to the second CD which has remixes. I think for the average fan the regular CD would be fine to listen to all the best music from this album.
I only received two songs and a booklet.  Not my fav songs either.  I want my money back! Definitely has download problems.
"I have been waiting a long SEVEN months for this album since the 2010 VMA's......And let me tell you that ""IT WAS WORTH THE WAIT!""...Lady GaGa has impressed and inspired me with each and every song on this album......My favorite album (non-stp replaying)......Thumbs Up GaGa!!!!!"
"Very few of these songs are ""catchy"" compared to past albums. I feel this album should be playing in the background at the Salvador Dali Museum.So many of these tracks are wandering without a clear melody. It's like she had 10000 ideas and wrote them into one song. Other songs are so repetitive I want to hit the stop button with a sledge hammer.$0.99 = fair price."
Who doesn't love this song?! It's an anthem and everyone could learn from it. I don't download a lot of music but I had to have this.
I have not stopped listening to this album since I bought it yesterday. I wouldn't say its the best album of the decade but I would say its the best Pop Album on the Decade right there with The E.N.D. by the Black Eyed Peas! Lady Gaga deserves much praise because she really goes all out on this album and puts all of herself into it. I pretty much love all the songs and love the bonus tracks as well. My faves on the album are Government Hooker The Edge Of Glory Hair and Scheide. There really is something for everyone on this album and I'm sure the hits from this album will be coming all year long. I loved The Fame but I believe this album exceeds it. Great Dance album!
If you thought you were gonna listen to a follow up to The Fame then just go away. This album is SO much better. It shows Gaga's true feelings and artistic views on the world and her little monster like me. :) She gets really deep and has catchy lines and this album really expresses who she is as a person. If your looking for some cheesy bubble gum pop record this is not for you. Its dark and fantastic just like gaga is. This album also takes you back to the 80's and is really amazing. If this album doesn't get 'album of the year' at the grammy's i would truly be disappointed. BUY THIS ALBUM
I bought this album today.  Amazon took my 99 cents but gave me nothing.  It said I'd already downloaded but I hadn't downloaded anything.  I called customer service who reset my downloads.  But nothing will download.  DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM or you will get ripped-off by Amazon too.
I really want to listen to the album HOWEVER Amazon Clous is not allowing it to download. Hopefully they fix this soon. Don't download it via Amazon if you want to listen to it now because it doesn't work... go to itunes or use another method of purchasing it until they fix it... ugh......!!!
This album is amazing.  Getting this is much worth it over getting the standard as Black Jesus  Amen Fashion is the most amazing song in space.  Little Monser or not  you were born to buy and love this album!
"Lady Gaga if you're reading this I'm sorry. I really wanted to give this a good review. I'm not a ""Little Monster"" but I was looking forward to your new album after some of your past hits the fantastic tracks from the Fame and Fame Monster. Meat dress aside I think you have a lot of creativity and interesting ideas to offer the world of pop music. So what happened? We went from most anticipated album of 2011 to lukewarm B-side offerings. Where did you go wrong? Without going into too much detail here are my thoughts including a rating for each song:1) Marry the Night - 1 of 5. A wholly forgettable generic and repetitive dance number. There's not much going on here. Not sure why it's the opening track it doesn't set a good tone for the rest of the album.2) Born this Way - 3 of 5. Like most every other reviewer it's hard not to hear Madonna's ""Express Yourself"" every time I listen to this song. I wanted to give this 2 stars but I give Gaga props for trying to reach out to the LGBT community. I think the sentiment is nice but the execution is lacking. Maybe with a different non-Madonna beat this would have worked better.3) Government Hooker - 4 of 5. One of the best songs on the album but with only a few meager offerings that doesn't say much. I could easily see this being played in a strip club. Starting with an operatic opening and moving into a dark techno underworld it has an interesting theme but the bouncy synthesizer sample might be annoying to some listeners.4) Judas - 4 of 5. I'm sort of on the fence between 3 and 4 stars but I'll cut Gaga some slack here. The message is interesting the melody and rhythm work well but there's still something off here. Judas is much more powerful both melodically and lyrically and a standout track on the album.5) Americano - 4 of 5. I actually really like this song. This would have made an excellent opening track. It starts off with a ""Hey Mambo"" introduction and moves into a trancey dance kind of beat. It has an interesting sound and at least seems like she's trying to make something good.6) Hair - 1 of 5. Ugh I don't even know where to begin with this one. Bland and tired blah pop Lady Gaga sings about her hair and the obvious ""free as my hair"" metaphor is repeated ad nauseum. Make it stop.7) Schei&szlig;e - 3 of 5. I want to like this song more. Lady Gaga goes German it sounds promising but never goes over the top like I was hoping it would. Heavy on the European dance beats it has a good rhythm but overall there's something missing. The lyrics start to get tiring and it seems like this could have been done better.8) Bloody Mary - 4 of 5. I'm being generous with the extra star it only gets 4 because it's the best of the slower songs. It's decent for a downtempo track I like the use of sampling and minor chords. The quiet melody and soft singing reminds me of Shirley Manson during her years with Garbage.9) Bad Kids - 2 of 5. I'm sorry but it feels like she's ripping off the Gossip with this song so points off for that. It's a seriously 80's track that would probably fit right in at retro dance nights but doesn't do much else.10) Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) - 1 of 5. Ugh! What the hell?? Based on the title I was really expecting more! If you're going to bring unicorns into your song then you really need to step it up - unicorns are awesome this song definitely is not. A boring power-pop ballad that fails to ever deliver. It reeks heavily of ""Poker Face"" but without the cleverness.11) Heavy Metal Lover - 2 of 5. Meh. Dull lifeless boring track that seems to drag on and on without ever getting anywhere. It just seems like a filler song with no real substance. The melody isn't bad but it just falls flat without anything to back it up.12) Electric Chapel - 2 of 5. Another downtempo song with a hypnotic sound but a lack of any real substance. This song has potential but once again it fails to ever deliver the true Gaga punch. Once again I'm strongly reminded of Garbage. Did Shirley Manson work on this album or what?13) Yo&uuml; And I - 0 of 5!!! HORRIBLE HORRIBLE H&Ouml;RRIBLE easily the worst song of the album and I dare say of Gaga's entire career. I wanted to stick a creature in my ear just to avoid listening to this. A terrible pop country abortion which drags on for 5 painful minutes. Barf. The stupid umlaut needlessly jammed into the title is representative of the song itself - extr&auml;neous and p&ouml;intless. I tried valiantly to listen to the entire thing but barely made it past the one minute mark. I skipped ahead to see if it got any better - it didn't. It was quickly deleted so I never have to hear it again. After that mess I had to listen to Paparazzi to remember what good Lady Gaga sounds like.14) Edge of Glory - 1 of 5. What a terrible way to close out yet another lackluster offering. It sounds suspiciously similar to track 6 Hair. This time she just repeats over and over and over that she's ""on the edge"" which will really start to grate on your nerves. I found myself thinking ""If she says 'I'm on the edge' one more time I'm going to push her off."" The cheesy 90's saxophones don't help either.By taking the average rating of the songs I gave the album an overall rating of 2 out of 5 stars (and yes I was giving a generous sprinkle of stars). Yikes! I don't know what happened here. I got this for 99 on release day and it was almost too much to spend. Lady Gaga I hope you learn from this. Go back to the studio and don't come back until you have something that tops your previous hits like Bad Romance Paparazzi Alejandro Telephone and the like. And please PLEASE for the love of Judas NO COUNTRY MUSIC!!!"
Took over 2 hours to download the songs due to the technical error from Amazon but for only 99 cents for the whole album it was worth it! Great deal!
I purchased the download during the 99 cent promotion period.  I figured the one song that I wanted would have cost more than that so I had nothing to lose.  I guess I wan in the minority since I had absolutely no problems downloading it.  I have to say it is the best 99 cents I have ever spent.  I love the entire CD - which is something I can't say about most of the CD's/Albums (yes I grew up with albums)& I can't stop listening to it. have even placed the entire CD into a playlist on my i-pod so I can listen to it at work.  Great Job Gaga! - looking forward to your next CD!
This album is a mess I got it during the $1 promotion. I couldn't find one song that I like. I think I'm starting to feel sorry for my dollar...:)
Love Lady Gaga! Record is true Gaga and great for working out!  I listen on the elliptical and it keeps me going!
It's a great album. I love Born this way. If you like Gaga then this is for you. Buy it today!
When it comes to Lady Gaga : everyone exagerates. Firstly her with her outrageous outfits and attitudes secondly her fans who worship her so much it becomes almost impossible to critize her and of course her haters who seem to have no limits at trying to trash her and ruin her reputation ignoring constantly that she is no matter what they might say an innovative artist and a pretty good singer.Because no matter what people think about her they can't deny that she has a voice and what a voice. Sadly it's often obstructed behind all the electronica and hype but on songs like Marry the night The edge of glory or You and I it's pretty obvious.And when this album was released a few months ago everyone's reactions to it were over the top as well to say the least so I think it's time to set the record straight.No this album is certainly not the album of the decade as she claimed months before its release but it's a good album nevertheless.She doesn't innovates a lot in here but in some songs she did (Americano : daring to mix mexican mariachi with modern techno : who would have ever thought of doing that ?! Government Hooker : a great modern rhythm like you don't often hear them in pop music Sheisse : well this track is strange I know but it's so much fun !).What bothers me the most about this album is that a lot of tracks are reminders of ancient Madonna songs she even tries (and succeed quite well as a matter of fact) to emulate her voice on songs like Bloody Mary or Electric Chapel.And like in all her previous albums her influences are quite obvious as well (a little bit of Madonna here some Cyndi Lauper there Spagna Whitney Houston etc...) but this results in a melting pot album where everyone (and I mean everyone) will always find a track to love even though it doesn't help making this album as cohesive as The Fame Monster was but it makes it a very entertaining and joyful experience that's for sure.But this album is very different from her previous album The Fame Monster. Monster was a very short album (only 8 tracks) but almost all of them were great. Here there are (in the Deluxe edition which I bought at least) 16 tracks and the problem is that inside you can find very good tracks and some awful ones as well let's be honest.On the plus side you have songs that could have been great singles (Marry the night Hair Sheisse...) what have already been singles (Born this way Judas) but on the downside there are a lot of fillers as well which I can't seem to warm up to no matter how hard I try (Highway unicorn Americano Heavy metal lover...).And finally you have also tracks like Electric Chapel who could have been even greater if they had a proper chorus for instance because the guitar in there is great but it doesn't remplace a good chorus in what could have been another smash hit that had the potential of rocking the charts madly otherwise (too bad this experiment failed but not by much really).But in the end it's still one of the greatest (if not the greatest) album(s) released this year. And even though it's not the album of the decade I'm sure about one thing : it certainly paves the way for an even greater album to come. I have faith in Lady Gaga for the future and I'm certain that we're not still done with her yet.
By fizzling I mean I've listened to this album too many times and the newness is wearing off so it's not as exciting anymore...but still amazing!I agree that this album is polarizing based on the love it/hate it reviews here (excluding Amazon complaints). I can basically split Lagy Gaga's (LG) fans into the Fame era and BTW era: one desires bubble-gum and flamboyant pop (Fame) and one craving the energetic and hard variety (BTW). Then there's the fans who like everything by Gaga though they are few apparently. I put myself into the BTW era because I love the dark and club-inspired vibe that LG exudes. In fact I don't really like The Fame and only became a LG fan with the Fame Monster.I love most of the songs on the album because they are dance-heavy especially Scheisse. They do not need remixes to dance to which was what I found lacking with previous albums because of the lack of speed and require remixes. The songs I do not really like are Highway Unicorn Bad Kids and You and I.Highway Unicorn: Sorry but I just can't take a song seriously when it references unicorns and the beats and lyrics aren't that great. With more listens I like it less.Bad Kids: reminds me too much of The Fame style which is the reason for my lack of interest but it's growing on me!You and I: Nothing wrong with this song just not my type of music genre (country).Another observation: low-star reviews claiming that all the songs sound the same are probably from people who download the album based on LG's fame and .99 cent deal and/or not fans of techno. I used to hate techno because I also thought it all sounded the same but now I know better. So best to disregard these reviews.I guess this review is more on social observation than actual album review. But if you love club music with heavy beats you got to get this! Seriously I dance/feel like dancing everywhere whenever I listen to the album (in my chair bed eating etc.). Thanks for reading!
Just great beats!  People will see a 62 year old white male head banging in the car to the great beats.
Born this way to dance club love and be free. With her third record out in just three years Born This Way is released under a cloud of controversies - ripping Madonna off on the title track a seemingly blasphemous second single titled Judas overexposure of her flamboyant self and a 99 Amazon offer. Has Lady GaGa gone mad gone loveless and done herself in? Is the album BAD? Listen to it BTW is no The Fame or The Fame Monster. Rather it is a darn good pop dance album. It is everything - electro rock/pop club anthems stomping tracks and 80s synth pop. At this juncture it could easily be construed as stylistically themeless or haphazard but the incredulous thing is that everything nearly always works. There are tracks like Schei&szlig;e Fashion of His Love Judas Born This Way and Edge of Glory that you just need to sing and dance to. There are moments where there's a little more introspective moments on You and I and  Bloody Mary. There is the electro rock glamour of Black Jesus/Amen Fashion and Heavy Metal Lover. At some points GaGa has indeed drawn many inspirations from Madonna and even Depeche Mode but there's never a doubt she leaves her imprint on every track. The only semblance of her past is probably Judas which perhaps is her least well-received single to date. With BTW GaGa is yet to be done and while this may still not be her best. Put your paws up...and I am sorry if this didn't turn you on onto the dancefloor... (A-)
I too purchased the cd yesterday when it was on sale and after 24 hours it still did not download. All I did was give the MP3  downloads customer service dept. a call and the guy gave me a link on my invoice to re-download the CD again. Once I clicked the link the songs started downloading in the Amazon MP3 downloader and it finished within 5 minutes. Now that I have heard the cd it was worth the wait.
Born This Way is a great! Lady Gaga is a great song writer and love to hear her sing! This is a must have!
This is a very different album. If you are a fan of Lady Gaga this is a must have. I am enjoying it.
First of all BE PATIENT! at first you'll only get like 6 songs but in the next hour or so  you'll have the whole album. This is truly an amazing deal! I can't believe that amazon is offering Born This Way for 1 dollar!...About the album: Well the album is amazing. Just listen to songs like You & I Bloody Mary Sheisse or Marry the Night. She's pushing boundries and setting new standars. GREAT ALBUM GAGA!
Really good stuff on first listen.  Lots of variety Gaga isn't to be put in a box stylistically.  She really does seem to have a magic touch and at this point in her career there hasn't been a single misstep.  Above and beyond the fashion the outrage and the expert use of the media Gaga will be around for a long time because she knows how to write a very catchy song.  There are plenty of them here.
I downloaded this album very fast without any delays. I love the album I can't stop listening to it. I was afraid that this album would not be as good as her previous work but I love the rich blend of sounds and for 99 cents I am not complaining. Where will you get such a great deal? Apple? I am going to download more music from Amazon I believe this is a far better alternative to the Itunes Store. Prices are cheaper and its the same music.
"With ""Born This Way"" Lady Gaga officially puts to rest the idea that she is simply Madonna version 2.0 with a dash of Grace Jones Cher Marilyn Manson etc thrown in.""Born This Way"" offers a unique almost bizarre pastiche of genres. Gaga manages to meld eurodisco arena rock and showtunes all together. Love it or hate it ""Born This Way"" is an original piece of work; there isn't anyone else out there that I know of making music like this and if they are they certainly aren't a pop superstar.For the most part I like it. And even the tracks I don't care much for I can still appreciate the creativity and earnestness. Thematically the album title reveals it all ... it's about being yourself. And Gaga is trying maybe even a little too hard to be everything that she is on this record. The album is the opposite of minimalist or streamlined ... it's a loud bombastic garish often joyful and occasionally brilliant affair.Highlights: ""Government Hooker"" ""Bloody Mary"" ""Bad Kids"" ""Electric Chapel"" ""You and I"""
Personally I found this album to be a work of art. Lady Gaga has expressed a new Gaga essentially. If you're looking for a sequel to Bad Romance or Pokerface you won't find it on here. On Born This Way Gaga goes above and beyond typical artists and provides fans or in her case Little Monsters with 14-17 exceptional songs that show how Gaga has matured as an artist. Each song sounds unique and provides a fresh taste to the pop world. Each song sounds nothing like you hear now on mainstream top-40 radio. It is a fresh taste of what is yet to come in the World of Gaga.Buy: Government Hooker Judas The Edge of Glory
Like many others out there I woke up to an e-mail from Amazon with this $.99 Lady Gaga offer and took advantage of it. I am still trying to get all the downloads and figure I will eventually. She is popular the price is right and I think the system is loaded down trying to fill all the requests.Others have said the same don't rate the service here talk about the content. This is my first lady Gaga purchase and I like it not all of it but enough to say I'm glad I bought it.Stay on topic be patient breath in and out come back and review this when you have had a chance to listen to the music.
"I'm really glad I bought this cd for .99 because that is all it is worth.I bought The Fame and The Fame Monster both great cds you can dance you can listen again and again to great tracks like Bad Romance... This disc??? As she frequently repeats in one track ""sh-t"" in German....  If the cover wasn't a clue in enough (I should have suspected something went awry)........Song Breakdown1) marry the night- the most tolerable song on the cd.  The intro is nice but the lyrics are rather pathetic ""I'm a soldier to my own emptiness"" really?  As the song picks up it begins sounding like something out of a quasi Madonna 1992 era cher fusion song.  I like Madonna and Cher but this is OLD.  What happened to Gaga being creative?  This is no ""Bad Romance""2) Born this way- yawn...its ok.  but its not ""amazing.""  It does sound like Madonna's Vogue....the electric carousel track in the background really kills it for me.  Its like ""what is that horrid synth?""3) government hooker... seriously what is she talking about?  The beginning sounds like a horrible version of Phantom of the Opera with a fake accent totally out of place and doesn't flow with the music at all.  Is it a German version of her with aphasia?  Its not sexy (if that is what it was supposed to be?).  The lyrics?  Mindless drone music.  There is no passion here or creativity ""as long as I'm your hooker just touch me I can be good or bad.""  Blah blah blah.  (yawns incessantly).  It sounds like she is saying as long as I'm your hookah in several lines.  And what is a government hooker?  This makes no sense logically.4) Judas- best song the beginning sounds like Bad Romance.5) Americano- highly offensive song.  I am not sure if others think so as well.  She starts off with stereotypes about Latin@s wearing ""floral shorts"" and ""singing in 8ths and barrio chords.""  Um excuse me not everyone does that who is Latin@.  If this doesn't bother anyone the track will..it sounds like bad Mariachi music on acid in the background.  She has some weird lines in a bad version of Spanish.  Then she starts going ""lalalalala"" (oh wait couldn't she think of a line to put there?) then if this wasn't bad enough she starts saying ""I don't speak your Jesus Christ"" in Spanish.  Um...I think Lady Gaga needs ESL classes not the people she is apparently signing about to bring their plight to the forefront..Jesus Christ is a proper noun... Now she just went out and offended the Latin@ community by also bashing their faith.  I'll pass on this horrid song and her stupidity.....The song is ear rape musically and in its insensitivity to Latin@s.6) Hair- this song is weird.  It gets a lot of airplay but don't be fooled..its lame.  It sounds like Kenny G got stuck in a washing machine and then gets abducted by Madonna and Cher.  The lyrics sound like something Rebecca Black would write.  ""I am my hair...I've had enough this is my prayer I'll die living just as free as my hair.""  Oh please...7)ScheiBe- this song is also strange and not interesting.  The lyrics (if you know anything about German) are also offensive.  Gaga attempts to speak in German and the beginning sounds pretty cool until she starts saying ""sh-t"" repeatedly in German. She keeps saying ""sh-t be mine"" then later she states ""I wish I could have fun without sh-t there.""  ???  So its ok if she uses a German word to personify men in a negative way?  How is this song good?  Even the music is all starting to sound the same on the cd by this point..8) Bloody Mary- I dont think Jesus said ""i'm going to dance with my hands above my head."" First weird lyric.  Second one is ""I wont crucify the things you do.""  Ok Lady Gaga ESL lesson 2- crucify is a VERB you can't crucify actions you can only crucify a noun.  I guess her 10 year old fans though won't know the difference.  The lyrics really do not make a lot of sense.  It has a lot of religious imagery that makes no sense even if you understand religion or do not.  Say I ignore that the music itself is weird..The background noise sounds like a frog and the autotune and the end of the verses sounds as if the frog is being stepped on by a construction worker.  And what is with that ""dumdumdum da da da"" line...ok again Lady Gaga runs out of lines and just says random nonsense.9) Bad Kids- this is like Michael Jackson on acid ""I'm a loser baby baby"" uh yeah..this song is not catchy....10)Highway Unicorn- it starts good like a Cher song being recontrived..you can dance to it. ""run run run with her.""  ok are you saying ""t-ts""?  I swear she is.  This is a listenable track but not as good as her weakest number on The Fame.11) Heavy Metal Lover- ""I want your whisky mouth all over my down south.""  Um no.. I'll pass on that.  Again this cd is not for her 12 year old fans.  Beyond that though really?  Is that all Lady Gaga can come up with is a trashy line.  The lyrics should be in a Rhianna song.  This song is overly autotuned.12) Electric Chapel- the beginning riff is ripped off from another older song.  Its tolerable but not that catchy.13) You and I- kind sad of a tune it reminds me of her other work but its not very good should be tuned down to just her and the piano.14) The Edge of Glory- ugh..she thinks mighty high of herself.  I don't think I like this song very much.  I'd rather listen to a remix of Celine Dion.  This song sounds like something Cher would do on a B side cd that was not released to the general public."
Love it! What an epic follow-up to Lady Gaga's last album. And who can complain about the .99 cents cost? For those in need of patience try saving it to your cloud drive and check back in a couple hours. It will probably have published (it takes time due to the current server overload)- and then you can stream it anywhere and download to whichever computer you choose. Lovely music Mother Gaga.
I really like Lady Gaga and this is a very good CD.  Since I have to use at least 20 words I will say it skipped when I played it on my Bose system --- turned out it was the system and not the CD.
Little monsters rejoice.  Gaga for life!!!  You will not be disappointed.  This is album is fun honest introspective dancey candid and true.  I love it!
First I want to apologize for my one star review yesterday as I was so frustrated with the download my first one ever.  Today it all worked perfectly.. so thank you Amazon for the great deal and thank you Lady Gaga.  Still getting to know her music but I think I am slowly becoming a monster.  Gaga you expose yourself in every way.
There are a few standout tracks such as Bloody Mary andGovernment Hooker. The rest is filler and 80s beat rehashed with self help lyrics.
"This album really does contain snippets of every kind of style.  It takes a steady ear but it pays off.  Try two listenings.  When told that Gertrude Stein did not like his portrait of her Picasso replied ""She will.""  One of my favorites is Bloody Mary in which she reveals perhaps the true message of the album: ""And when you're gone I'll tell them my religion's you."""
5/26:Holy crap I'm so annoyed.  Amazon sent an e-mail about how to download the album since it didn't work on 5/23 - - and the instructions don't work.  Simple things shouldn't be so difficult. ;p5/23:Uhhh... can't rate the album if I can't get it to download can I?It's only available to download for a limited time after you buy it so after I did the troubleshooting it was already too late.Good job Amazon!
"The 'Born This Way' LP 'Born This Way: The Remix' & 'Lady GaGa Presents The Monster Ball: Live From Madison Square Garden all packaged together is most definitely a ""Little Monster"" must-have.Pro: 2 different albums and the Madison Square Garden live performance on DVDCon: the packaging/casing should have been made of plastic/steel; my album sleeves have a lot of wear & tear.Overall I'm a happy monster having the recent albums and the live concert performance on DVD. Paws Up!"
I love this album and I bought it when it was offered for a dollar for some promotion.  It is a great album.  I love Lady Gaga and really enjoy listening to this album.  I also like to watch her Monster's Ball concert.  She's great!
Regardless of previous posts about rating this is indeed NOT COMPLETELY TRUE! I only received one song from the album and the digital booklet. Amazon should take care to fix this.
Great tunes Gaga!  Very catchy!(Also loving Amazon Mp3 and CloudPlayer but that's not what the 5 star rating is all about)
There's an unnerving moment that occurs when hearing Lady Gaga's second album Born This Way for the first time. It comes as soon as the plodding keyboard chords ring out on opening track Marry the Night and you wonder if the stage is set for this to be the first of several self-indulgent ballads. It will be a fear familiar to anyone who tuned into Radio 1's Big Weekend expecting a rapid-fire run through her storming pop hits and was met inexplicably with several minutes of jazz trumpet. Among the madness the Madonna-comparisons and the meat dresses has Lady Gaga lost track of what made her little monsters fall in love with her in the first place? The answer is NO.The album is a roaring success in my eyes and in the eyes of many critics today. It may not be the best album out their but it really is a great follow-up album to the fame that was filled with pop tunes that were fresh and original. BORN THIS WAY doe's exactly the same it's original and it breathes new life into the pop genre!Her third studio album (counting The Fame Monster as an album here) really is worthy of the hype its been given and I think GaGa deserves all the credit and praise she is going to get in the coming months for this album and she really is an inspiration for us all.
"I am not really crazy about mainstream pop music but I have to admit I am rather fond of Lady Gaga. I have been fan since Lady G burst out on the music scene in 2008. Her songs are ridiculously catchy. As a fan of synthpop/new wave music Lady G's music definitely have a synthpop/new wave flavor.I recently bought her new album Born This Way today. I have yet to stop listening to it today. The music is addictive to say the very least with its infectious pop hooks and club friendly beats. I have to admit I wasn't really wild about the title track (the first single) when it first came out but after many listens the song has really grown on me. The second single ""Judas"" is okay but lacks the punch and energy of its predecessor. The melodies just didn't do much for me. It's not a bad song especially compared to duds like ""Government Hooker"" (my least favorite track on the album) and ""You and I"". The tracks that really stood out with me is ""Marry the Night"" ""Americano"" and ""Hair"". Those songs have a ton of energy and just drowning in catchy pop hooks. I really love ""Hair"" which has a glam rock flavor.I think this album could have been flawless had it been under an hour. I wasn't too crazy about 2-3 tracks. Overall Born This Way is an immensely fun pop album."
"Heard of Lady Gaga? She's this loopy pop singer with weird hair and clothes and most people either love her or hate her. Well my personal opinion of Lady Gaga's persona won't come into this -- it's all about her new album ""Born This Way."" Well brace yourself: It's a bloated mess that rambles on far too long with too many songs too much noise and no unifying style.""Born This Way"" presents itself as a gay anthem and it does this by thumping you over the head with obvious shout-outs like ""Don't be a drag/just be a queen"" and ""No matter gay straight or bi/Lesbian transgendered life."" But all Madonna comparisons aside this song is a mess -- the producers heaped so many layers of sound that it sometimes sounds like Gaga is being smothered.Then there's ""Judas"" the second single of this album. This suffers from the same choking overproduction as ""Born This Way"" with Gaga's voice being smushed down under a thick fog of synthpop. Then again she spends half the song squawking ""Juda-JUDA-AW!"" like an epileptic goose so that might be a good thing.But what of the other songs? Well the album actually starts quite strong with the dark glittering ""Marry the Night"" and the bleakly desperate sex-with-presidents thumper ""Government Hooker."" But things start going off the rails with the goopy romanticism of the Spanish-flavored ""Americano"" the vaguely Germanic club melody ""Scheibe"" and the cheesy ""Hair.""After that Gaga just... seems to stop trying and lets the following songs decay into a soggy mess of mediocre club pop. Some of the songs barely have melodies (""Black Jesus - Amen Fashion"" ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)"") and some are just so bland that it's hard to remember them (""The Queen""). I like ""Electric Chapel"" but most of these songs could have been cut without anyone noticing.She does rouse herself enough to give distinctive sounds to the last couple songs... but they're AWFUL sounds: ""You And I"" sounds like a country singer wandered into a dance club and just started singing and ""The Edge of Glory"" is a horrendously cheesy power ballad complete with SAXOPHONES.In a nutshell ""Born This Way"" is a huge bloated mess bogged down with excess and collapsing under its own weight. It feels like Lady Gaga is trying to do EVERYTHING in this album. More sound! More musical genres! More random references to fashion nightclubs sex and gay people! More dance songs that nobody can remember when they're over!As for Gaga's lyrics they have some interesting elements like the strong undercurrent of Catholic/religious symbolism and the idea that ""bad kids"" are just fine because they were ""born that way."" But her writing also tends to be insanely clumsy (""You're black white beige chola descent/You're Lebanese you're Orient"") and her symbolism is so obvious that it leaves bruises between your eyes.And her voice? It's the strongest part of any song where she tries but too often it falls by the wayside in this album. In some songs it's swamped by all those electronic layers and in some songs she just sort of croons without putting any effort into it.If they had trimmed off the B-sides and the extra production ""Born This Way"" could have been a pretty decent pop album. But instead it feels like a collapsing monument to pop excess."
"I just finished speaking with an Amazon MP3 Customer Service Agent and she explained it to me clearly that their server is having technical difficulties due to the overwhelming amounts of downloads of Lady Gaga's new album. She reassured me that their technical teams are working diligently to solve the problem.Also she mentioned not downloading any other songs or albums until they fix the backlog since any more songs added to your cloud player might be placed on queue.

after announcing last summer that her next album would be born this way it is finally here! and it was WELL WORTH the wait!this is pop at it's absolute best! get ready for born this way to dominate the charts for a while!
"My favorite artists are The Smiths Radiohead Pet Shop Boys Manic Street Preachers etc...I'm 32 years old and have a collection of 3.000+ cds. I never thought I would feel like this again... but after 7 years (since The Killers' debut) I'm truly in love with an artist.I used to think that Lady Gaga was in the same league as Britney Spears and Cristina Aguilera so I never really gave her much attention.After hearing ""The Fame Monster"" and especially now with ""Born This Way"" I think she should not be compared to Madonna she's already better than her.She should be compared to Michael Jackson from now on.I think ""Born This Way"" will be seen as a landmark in pop music like ""Thriller"" or ""Bad"".Track-by track (Special Edition):1- ""Marry the Night"" - Touching beautiful heartbreaking perfect. Deserves to be a HUGE hit and a pop classic! 10/102- ""Born this way"" - The worst song on the cd but still good. I don't need to describe it to you. 7/103- ""Governement Hooker"" - The introduction sends shivers down my spine. Very seductive and original in its own way. 9/104- ""Judas"" - You probabbly know this one too. It restored my faith in her work after the release of the ""Born this way"" single. Its structure is similar to ""Bad Romance"" but with a harder edge. It's great live. I love it! 10/105- ""Americano"" - One of the most original songs of the album. As a brazilian I'm really fond of its latin flavour. It reminds me of ""La Gloria"" by Erasure. 95/106 - ""Hair"" - A more conventional song but a very good one. As a songwriter I feel the urge to edit it to avoid the repetition of the first verse of the chorus. In my opinion it would make the song even better. 85/107- ""Scheibe"" - This is fantastic. Takes me inside a Berlin club. Again I would edit this track by letting the spetacular background music shine a little bit more. The german verses are repeated too much. Besides that it has an excellent chorus. 9/108- ""Blood Mary"" - If Gaga releases this as a single I'm sure a lot of people who thinks she's just an ordinary pop singer would change their opinions like I changed mine. It's an absolute success. The gregorian chants and the bridge are awesome. It deserves a video. One of the best here (with ""The Queen""). 10/109 - ""Black Jesus Amen Fashion"" - It grew on me. ""Jesus is the new black!"". Sounds like it was written in the early 90's. 9/1010- ""Bad Kids"" - Guitars on the verses. Synths on the chorus. I think it will be great when played live. Lovely hooks. 95/1011- ""Fashion of his love"" - Dedicated to Alexander Mcqueen. There's a clear nod to Madonna in this. It's a lovely pop song. 9/1012- ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) - Pure Pop Art. Great chorus. 95/1013- ""Heavy Metal Lover"" - Experimental Art Pop. It has ""New York club scene"" written all over it. Very important in the album context. 9/1014- ""Eletric Chapel"" - Guitar Intro. Ends the ""Art Pop Trilogy"" of the album. By this track I started asking myself: ""Is there any bad song on this album""? 9/1015- ""The Queen"" - It's a mystery why this song is a bonus track. It's my favorite. Two songs in one. I can't decide if I prefer the PERFECT POP of the first part or the beautiful and emotional vocals and guitar solo in the second part. In a perfect world it should be a number one single. 10/1016- ""You and I"" - It got soul. Not my cup of tea but still very good. 75/1017- ""Edge of Glory"" - A perfect way to end a classic album. 10/10Thank you Gaga for making me feel excited about music again!"
Beautiful music! shes evolved so much as a misical artist i love itthose of you who want the the lady gaga from The Fameplease stop

I think i listen to this CD every day! And I am 46 years old.  She is amazing! I love her
Within 5 minutes I'm already playing it on my iTunes.Looked at my Cloud Player in the browser only one song available so I downloaded and installed Amazon Cloud Player all the songs were available downloaded all and now in my iTunes.Good or bad album if it's $0.99 why not get it. At least support the musicians in these times.Thank you for the deal
"(I have not listened to the Special Edition album with the bonus songs and the version I have is unfortunately censored. But I know that isn't Lady Gaga's doing so I'm not even going to dignify it with a complaint.)BOOM.That's sort of what happened in my brain when I realized that Lady Gaga had a massive amount of talent. I refused to see or believe it for the first two years of her career but this year it hit me. Now I'm not a fan of pop music in general. I actually spent several hours last night listening to some of the top female pop stars trying to come up with a soundtrack for the play I am directing...and somewhere around Ke$ha I decided that shooting myself would be a better way to end the night. I'm sorry I don't mean to hate on Ke$ha but that stuff just isn't for me.I have been a closet Madonna fan for many years. She's a smart woman who knows how to work the business and she sings live despite all the dancing. She has grown so much over the years and reinvents herself quicker and more frequently than anyone else.But THEN... Then... There is Lady Gaga. At first I thought she was sort of like Madonna on crack reinventing herself every day. But no she doesn't ""reinvent"" herself. That would imply that she tries to be more appealing and kitschy. If anything Lady Gaga started out kitschy doing a style of music and lyrics that would gain pop music listeners. Once she was in the door she was freer to let her freak flag fly and I think she started to become more Herself. That's what happened on The Fame Monster. We started to see the real Lady Gaga.I have been listening to Born This Way for the last several days and it is so surprisingly different from everything she's done previously. She still speaks her mind and says things people will probably take issue with (just listen to Government Hooker Judas or Heavy Metal Lover). But...it is an excellent album. No one song is outstanding that is to say literally Stands Out from the rest but I don't think that's a bad thing. That means that no song is a real dud. They've all got something interesting and likeable. She has a very good ear for catchy chord progressions and I just discovered why her songs don't sound like normal pop to me: they're almost always in a minor key. Crazy! This album especially feels like techno/electronica married to metal rock country and pop. Depending on the song. No other music sounds like this though people have said that all of the songs ""sound alike"". I do and don't understand that. When a song starts I know which one it is. And yet the entire album has a very heavy very strong beat. It's employed on almost every song which gives the album a darker more industrial sound. And because she does have such a fine ear for music it's like she has an inner compass for what people want to hear what makes a ""hit"" single.I think the reason none of the songs have done exceptionally well on the charts is because in making all of them really good none of them are truly spectacular. At least not at first or even second listen. I would argue that all of the songs have something spectacular about them. People have accused her of selling out and trying too hard...and I think the former is completely false and that the latter is only sort of true. You can tell she put a lot into this album. It isn't a flawless album but compared to where she is coming from and the fact that this is basically her sophomore album...it's great. She shows maturity in so many ways and it is simply a joy. I go back and forth on which song is my pick-of-the-day. Yesterday it was Americano. What will it be today?With Born This Way Lady Gaga has shown us that she is not just trying to get attention. She already has it. Now she wants to show us who she really is. She has grown a lot and this new album is obviously deeply personal. I don't remember the last time a pop star has bared so much soul within an entire album. Every song has some meaning to her and it's a little hard to tell with all the poppiness but you hear her sing live and you'll understand what I mean. Listen to her in interviews talk about this album. It is pure Gaga and for the first time we are truly seeing HER.Lady Gaga loves her fans and she loves pushing boundaries. She is theatricality incarnate.I think Lady Gaga fans don't like this album for the same reason Metallica fans don't like what happened in the '90s. ""This isn't the music I fell in love with!"" ...No duh. If these artists kept churning out the same $%^& they wouldn't be Artists. They would stagnate burn out and/or fade away. They might make a come-back or they might just fade from memory. In THREE YEARS Lady Gaga has insured a place in people's memories for at least the next decade. It doesn't really matter what happens to her after this album what direction she goes in...there's no going back."
I purchased this album almost 10 hours ago and i knew it was going to take some time to download because of the high demand. But my card was charged and under the amazon orders is says that my order was processed which means it should be downloading now. Well its not and its not downloading into the cloud player. What a waste of time and a dollar. I was going to have my sisters get the album also because they really wanted it but there is no way i'm going to put them through all this crap.
In all objectivity while 'The Fame' was a certainly a good album 'Born This Way' makes it looks like commercialized trash. However Gaga cannot be faulted for this. Those familar with how the recording industry operates should be fully aware of the treatment of a new artist. Here after proving herself an international superstar Mama Monster takes the wheel and really displays her vocal power range and versatility; non-fans will have to admit that the girl can definitely sing circles around her contemporaries. The songwriting on this album is remarkably substantialintrospective and is simply an exaggerated version of her nights at the Bitter End in New York City. This album is a sincere and honest work. Maintaining consistency the production is of tasteful clean quality never skimping on emotion and fun. No need to skip around on this one and the song order flows quite nicely. The Special Edition includes a few extra treats specifically some very Euro-sounding avant-garde pop. Enjoy!
"this album is very good. it's a different direction for lady gaga but definitely a quality album. each song shares a similar sound yet they're completely different. they're all such catchy songs and the meanings behind all of them are perfect. i highly recommend purchasing ""born this way""! (:"
"Lady Gaga as an entity in culture has turned into - to put it charitably - something unique.  Some love that some hate it but I do think her personality is distinct from her music and it's helpful to remind yourself of that perhaps over and over and over again.  The truth is I appreciate that the one thing Lady Gaga has never done is be boring but even if that weren't how I felt I would have trouble denying how much my mind goes back to these songs.  Some people heard ""Born This Way"" as a single and loved it most of my friends - on Capitol Hill (Hipster Central) in Seattle - hated it.  I thought it a bit of a bridge too far on first listen but the melody kept drawing me back in and eventually its sense of celebration was so invigorating I just gave in and admitted I loved the thing.  Same with ""Edge Of Glory"" whose melody overtook me to such an extent I had to admit it was sort of brilliant and probably the best single of the year.  But those are just the beginning.  Almost every song did it to me - sucked me in just by making me smile at its own tonic addictiveness and wackadoo personality.  The opera-vocal-climb opening of ""Government Hooker"" led into the strangest verses I'd heard in years (""Put your hands on me John F. Kennedy"").  The German spouting ""Scheisse"" turned out to be a weird dance anthem to female empowerment.  ""Heavy Metal Lover"" sounded like nothing until its dark bass kept rattling around in my brain even with barely anything but a couple of kinky lines running along with it.  So my suggestion for this album?  If you like music that expands in personality is fun and - yes - you don't entirely mind this current era of pulsating unapologetic club music you really will find a lot to dig into with Born This Way."
Lady Gaga was brilliant when it came to making Born This Way. I love this song so much because it has a meaning for the world not to just one person. Instead of the Star Spangled Banner being the national anthem it is now Born This Way. Maybe we should start singing it at important events. The special edition totally rocks!
"**Originally posted on ""#1 Hits From Another Planet"" - 5/31/11**Not much more can be said about this album really. In the pop world it's easily the most anticipated of the year. In fact I can't remember an artist able to elicit such anticipation since the days of the Jacksons Madonna Prince etc. That may sound like overkill but there really hasn't been an event record like this in years. The closest thing would have been some of the releases of the late 90's early 00's teen pop boom but I think this is even bigger. So does the album hold up to the hype? Let's see.1. Marry The Night - Opens with a theatrical slow-burning vocal before blasting into an insanely unstoppable dance beat. As far as the album's concerned it's one of the more traditional sounding tracks. It only descends into madness at the very end (which coincidentally is the best part) 10/102. Born This Way - The first single which has experienced a resurgence in my eyes since it was released. The lyrics are simplistic yet somewhat controversial because of it. This will end up as one of 2011's biggest singles and represents a shift in Gaga's music to something more universal and stadium ready. 10/103. Government Hooker - A departure from the first two tracks this brittle number uses a simple casio beat as its base upon which Gaga vamps and yells. It's rather experimental to be placed so early in the running order but rewards with repeated listens. 10/104. Judas - The second single which should have been a much bigger hit than it was. Essentially Bad Romance Pt. II this improved the more I listened to it. Deceptively simple yet with enough staying power to match that thunderous beat. 10/105. Americano - A complete shift in town this Mexican-inspired track is probably the most theatrical on here. It's great (and slightly mental) in its own right but I find myself skipping it in the context of the album. 8/106. Hair - The first of several rock/pop/dance hybrids this is an enormous stadium belter with a similar message to the title track. As a song it's even more successful. One of the best melodies on the album with jackhammer production and a message that busts through the silliness of the lyrics. 10/107. Schei&szlig;e - One of the definite standouts this pulsing club track segues between spoken German and English. It has one of the simplest melodies but a wicked chorus and a general sense of craziness that pulls you back for more. 10/108. Bloody Mary - A demented semi-ballad with some truly unique production. This is that ""avante garde"" piece on the album and comes just in time to slow things down a bit. 10/109. Black Jesus + Amen Fashion - The first of the deluxe version's three bonus tracks and also my favorite. Moves between autobiographical lyrics and dance music nonsense but benefits by fantastic understated production and a great melody. 10/1010. Bad Kids - Another standout. This was one of my initial favorites and remains so. I love the use of guitar and the surging verses. Very 80's but in the best way possible. 10/1011. Fashion Of His Love - Even more 80's. The production's too cluttered and this sounds far more like Madonna than the title track but it's still pleasant filler. 8/1012. Highway Unicorn (Road To Love) - A psychedelic bombastic arena rocker that's more than a little silly. It's the kind of sound that I'd hoped she'd attempt yet falls just a little short of what I think is possible. It's almost too brash and chaotic and could do with some finessing. Still it's by no means a song to skip. 9/1013. Heavy Metal Lover - Back to straight-up dance pop though with a softer more European flavor this time around. It doesn't stand out much amongst everything else on here but it's a great track nonetheless. 9/1014. Electric Chapel - This sounds a lot like Billy Idol's White Wedding which is a huge complement. The synth/guitar combo is exactly the sound she's pushing throughout the album and this is one of the best examples of that. An instant hit. 10/1015. The Queen - The last ""bonus track"" and probably the weakest. I like the melody but the lyrics are pretty weak. I'm not sure why ""b*tch"" is censored in the bridge as it sounds quite strange to me. The song does provide a fantastic segue into the next one though. 8/1016. Yo&uuml; And I - The only non-electronic track on the album though it's given full stadium-stomper power ballad production thanks to Mutt Lange. It would be a great song no matter how it was produced even though it feels a little out of place here. 9/1017. The Edge Of Glory - Quite possibly Gaga's best song to date. This encompasses everything that works about this album in one track. The production is stellar but it's the anthemic melody that really sets this apart. It's hard to imagine a better US single this year. 10/10Album Grade: 9.5/10"
"I purchased this the first day of release but wanted to listen to it for a couple of weeks before I reviewed it.  My immediate reaction was that I was disappointed.  These songs weren't as catchy as her previous hits.  After continuing to listen they really grew on me and while I still don't care for them quite as much as her earlier work she does make some really interesting vocal and musical choices so for that I think it deserves 3.5 stars.  My husband who is a classic rock fan loves it and thinks it deserves 4 stars.My favorite song by far is ""You and I."""
Best CD Ever!!! But only have 14 songs.. Have another versi&oacute;n with the 17 songs.. I Love Gaga. . .
I thought that it was going to be awesome; but dont really like it ... too much of the same disturbing sounds.....and I like Lady Gaga!!!! sorry not this one monsters.....I am OUT!!!!!!
Gaga really has grown up with 80's music you can tell on this album how much she loves 80's music. Gaga is bringing back 80's music which is good because I've missed it. She has amazing influences. Lady Gaga has talent you just have to see it. I recommend the Special Edition of Born This way it's worth the extra. The Fame was a great debut album she did fall down a little bit on Born This Way because it sounds a lot like Madonna even though I like it because I've missed Madonna's 80's music but I will say no one will ever replace Madonna. Maybe Gaga will go in a different direction musically with her next album because I think her fans need that. I give this album 4/5 stars because there is a few songs I don't like but I do like most of the album. I would say at least check this album out. My favorite songs on this album are:1. Marry The Night2. Fashion of His Love3. Bad Kids4. Electric Chapel5. Bloody Mary6. Born This Way
A good album for an artist that is unique in her style her costume and in her personality. Lady GAGA is a force to be reckoned with in the music world.
I'm shocked that the woman who could come up with so much amazing music fell totally flat on her face with this album.  It's nothing but dissonance and I can't really say I enjoy listening to screeching noises something akin to the sound Jim Carrey made in the car next to the Hitchhiker in Dumb 'n' Dumber.  My god Lady Gaga......this album totally blows.  I was so excited for it because Born this Way was amazing.  and then every other song is just GOD AWFUL.  I can't even pretend to write an eloquent or reasoned review of this.  wow.  Thank God it only cost me ninety nine cents.  FAIL.
i'm so glad i got this so cheap even if her words are worth a thousand pictures &lt;3so glad i didn't listen to the leaked tracks.
"I only recently discovered Lady Ga Ga while watching the William Clinton Foundation Decade of Difference concert on Yahoo!  The entire program was wonderful but in my opinion [and I think the audience agreed] Ms. Ga Ga stole the show.  I purchased the ""Born This Way"" CD based on the diversity talent and originality she exhibited during the concert and am very pleased with the recordings.  Take it from me...I've been around through a number of music genres...this is the first real talent and intelligence I have seen in one artist in a very long time."
I'm not a Lady Gaga fan but keep hearing so much about her that I decided to take a chance on this album when it came out since I had heard a couple of the remixes and thought they were ok. Unfortunately the album doesn't have the versions of the songs I've heard and what is on the album I just don't get.The big surprise for me was a couple of songs later in the album which sounded pretty polished and (don't kill me for this) almost like something you're hear on pop/country radio. Sort of slick production and pretty well written. More like radio hits than something you'd hear at a club. Unfortunately not something I'm likely to listen to again. If I want that kind of stuff I'll listen to somebody who specializes in it.This album isn't 100% terrible but as much as I've heard about her I expected more.
Not my favorite album by Gaga but it's still pretty good nevertheless.  If I had known I would have bought individual tracks instead.
I was going to buy this because I am a Lady GaGa fan. So imagine my surprise when I see it for 99 cents. :-)Very happy with my purchase and suffered no problem downloading. (I bought early this morning)Fantastic album!
I am in love with this album!!! It has a little bit of everything and gives what her fans want. Gaga is the one artist to stand on top of them all for originality and true lyrics that pump out the best album I have heard from any pop artist. She is just more than an amazing voice with pulse pounding beats. Gaga is a true inspiration to us all and her music from this album and her other albums prove she is not scared of all those haters! No one can tear her down! This album is another reason that proves her longevity and  heart that goes into her music. Long Live Lady Gaga!!! WE love you so much!!! Keep it up!!! My Favorite Tracks include Marry the Night Born This Way Government Hooker Judas Hair Bad Kids Heavy Metal Lover You and I The Edge of Glory.
The Album was okay for the price ($0.99) but the experience with Amazon wasn't. This is not the first time I've bought music from Amazon but due to the crush of people about half of my songs didn't download and specific to that list was one of the few on the album that I actually wanted. I've emailed Customer Service who sent me a form letter saying that I could redownload but the option isn't available like they claim.There's another promo going on today so just beware. You'll be paying in frustration what you save in dollars.Edit: After another round of emails to Customer Service I got access to download it again. It was nice and quick to download.  Sadly now that I've had a chance to listen to it most of the songs are unimpressive.  Her last album (which I bought at full price) was a far better deal.
The album downloaded VERY quickly and I had no problems. The only thing I had to figure out was how to get it from Amazon Cloud to my iTunes but even that went smoothly after some researching. 99 cents is definitely a bargain for a brand new complete album whether you think this is good album or not.
I bought this album w/the Amazon MP3 app for blackberry 4 hours ago and the songs still haven't downloaded + I keep getting error messages then I logged on to the actual Amazon site and I see that mostly everyone's having problems here as well. I'll be happy if the problem gets fixed and I get the WHOLE CD for 99 cents and if it never get's fixed I'll just have to go to a real store and buy a real CD full price. I guess this is what I get for being a cheapskate :(::UPDATE::After 10 hours of downloading time I finally got all songs. It was well worth the wait the album is lovely!
Gaga has done it again! This album is so passionate and different from her last album! But I love it soooo much!!! Such a great buy and you can play it over and over again :D
I love this album. I agree it's different than her previous albums but I still absolutely love it! I can't wait for her next album to come out!!
This album makes you feel free. GaGa truely let herself be shown within every song now that she could create her own sound without any nagging music editors or producers. Every song is upbeat catchy and worth listening to. Highly recommend it. xD
All the songs are very pop-y and I was expecting more from Lady Gaga to prove me that she is really THE SH*T. Kind of disappointed with this. I will wait for her next album and will continue to support her.
You taste like whiskey when kiss me ooh give anything again to be ur baby doll ;DDDD For real where is the love???!!! Its Gaga! Totally different then her last but i love that she switched it up! You & I plus Schei&szlig;e are my top favs. I can't wait for what she has planned for this following tour!!!
Lady Gaga if you really care about your fans like you said you did when I saw you at MSG this past august DEMAND that amazon get their glitches fixed. I bought the album yesterday for 99c helping to propel you to number 1. However Amazon is unable to complete the download the 4 songs I have sound great but amazon is not answering my or your many other fan's emails and I am not able to download the other songs I paid for. I'm pissed off! I'm gonna have to take a Bikram class at LES Bikram 2 blocks away. Hey maybe we used to be neighbors?
Lady Gaga continues to impress with her latest album. I can't get enough of Born This Way The Edge of Glory and You and I. She is one of my favorite artists and I am continually surprised and amazed by what she comes up with!
"It isn't as awful as some people claim it to be but neither is it the epic masterpiece others claim it to be. This isn't ""The Fame"" Gaga. This album is nothing like its predecessors. It's heavier darker... edgier. That being said Lady Gaga tries a bit too hard to push the envelope. It isn't done effortlessly like those before her. Vocally it's a pretty sound album (as in she sings a lot more than just morphing her voice. The eponymous track The Edge of Glory and Hair are examples). Lyrically it leaves something to be desired. A lot of the lyrics are repetitive. How one overuses their OWN NAME in songs is beyond me but she managed to get it done. I didn't know about the .99 two-day sell from Amazon. But to me that explains the inflated 1.11 million first week sales. Otherwise only her hardcore fans will like this. I am a fan but I'm not so blinded by an artist to know when music sounds bad overproduced and all-around cheesy. I also know that drawing inspiration is a thing artists do to pay homage to their idols. But pretty much copy and pasting is not cool. I challenge you to find one song on here that doesn't sound like something that's been done. Fashion of His Love sounds like I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me) yes the Whitney Houston song right down to the noisy chorus. I never thought I'd think ""Whitney"" while listening to a Lady Gaga song. smhThe best tracks are Born This Way Bloody Mary The Queen (where she does her best Freddie Mercury impression ironically) and The Edge of Glory.The worst tracks are Americano Government Hooker and Bad Kids.Most annoying tracks are Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) Scheibe and Judas.The only thing we can hope for is that she learns from this debacle and next time makes ""... music for the ears not for the eyes."""
Album for $1 can't be be beat.  Lady gaga and amazon are awesome for offering this.  If you're complaining because the servers are a little slow or backed up...then you suck and get over it.  Oh yeah apple you suck too.
and for the price it was such a steal. shes gone form pop to electro to rock and i love it. these songs have meanings compared to the fame monster. a must to get the whole album!
This artist can do no wrong. Each song is great and she pushes the bounds of current pop music. She said this album would revolutionize pop music and she was dead on. Other artists will strive to emulate but none will compare.
This album is absolutely amazing. I've been listening to it every single day since May 23rd 2011! I HIGHLY recommend this for anyone who is a lover of music.
I just purchased this item and I'm only being given 5 songs from a 14 song album. I didn't read anywhere that the daily deal was exclusively for only PART of the album...Needless to say for the first time I'm disappointed with my Amazon purchase.
In my opinion this is the best album Lady Gaga has released so far in just the 3 and half years that she's been present in the music industry she's managed to accomplish so much and change the pop genre.
This is a great Cd. I have been waiting months for its release. I've bought six copies so far. Every song is meaningful and great.
This album is okay but frankly I was expecting better considering how good her older stuff is.  I'm glad I got a super deal on this because if I paid full price I would really be disappointed.
"There is a ""thing"" known in the recording industry as the ""sophomore curse."" This usually occurs when an artist has such a phenomenally successful first recording that all hype and expectations on the second are held at such a standard that it is almost never achieved.  Sad to say such is the case with GaGa's sophomore recording ""Born This Way."" While ""The Fame Monster"" was a breath of fresh air to a pop/rock field which had become stagnant ""Born This Way"" is stagnant.  It is over-produced each track actually sounds identical to the next and the imaginative edge which Ms. GaGa experienced and defined in her first recording is seriously lacking in this attempt. It seems that her message while being blunt as always (which is fine) is so in your face that it touches no one. The album is dull unimaginative and boring. GaGa is a talent there is no doubt about that.  What she needed to do is pour more of her talent into this album and less into her social causes and her meat dress.  A sad second release."
My wife is into this music.  She said she likes the cd.  So a happy wife is a happy life to all you wise men out there.
"Apperently Lady Gaga is only allowed to sing songs like Poker Face and Just Dance. Because with the negative reviews on this album ""it's not like her other albums"" Well damn thank gawd it's not.  Lady Gaga can actually break through musical boundries and bring back the fabulous music from the 80s and 90s which I grew up on and listen to quite often!  Yes the album is all over the place but it is fabulous!!!  Not a waste of money at all :) :)  ScheiBe Hair Mary the Night and The Edge of Glory are probably best songs on the album amazing!!"
Though a departure from her first album this album is loaded with all sorts of dance tracks with electronic beats. The 99 cent sale was also enticing not that I wouldn't have purchased this album anyway.
This is a really super CD. More words required for the review. This is Gaga. what more can be said.
"I've never really listened to GaGa extensively and I really am not familiar with alot of her tracks. I don't own her first CD and I've only heard the radio singles Teeth and Speechless before this album.However I kinda liked what I heard but never got the album. However I noticed Amazon was selling this album for 99 cents and I told myself to just buy it. I did. I was shocked.The album was really quite good. It wasn't *amazing* but I'm now alot more interested in Gaga's music then I was beforehand. The songs were strong catchy and dark. Being a fan of rock this album quite pleased me.Anyway I'm gonna do a short track-by-track of the normal version of the album.Marry the Night - 6/10I found it a rather odd song and I liked the beginning but about midway through it just seemed like the title was being repeated over and over and over again... Her voice is good but the song got a little dull.Born This Way - 7.5/10Being the lead single I wasn't terribly impressed however I found that the song stuck in my head for *forever*... Then Glee did a cover and I liked it even more. The song grew on me and it got better in my head. I'd not be shocked if this is sitting at a 9/10 in a few weeks in my mind.Government Hooker - 8/10The beginning was just damn weird. And somehow I found it fascinating. I loved the voice mix and once it got into the song I loved it even more. It was dark creepy and so interesting to listen to. The lyrics were dark but extremely clever. (i.e. ""Come on touch me John F. Kennedy"" made me grin)Judas - 9/10A brilliant song. The lyrics was smart the song isn't terribly overwhelming in terms of sound and Gaga's voice shines. The music is fun and the blending of the voice and music was great. I really liked this one :)Americano - 9/10Such a strange song and seems inspired by the ""I Speak No Americano"" song by... erm... whoever sang that song >.> But it was a cool song and I liked hearing Gaga sing in spanish. It was also a really dark song for some odd reason. The music just keep it so dark and mysterious that I was drawn in.Hair - 8.5/10I liked it but at the same time I didn't. It was a really strange song and the lyrics were also pretty weird. However it just got better as it went on and grew into a really nice ballad in the middle of the album.Schei&szlig;e - 10/10I love this song. I have no real reason why. I just do. The start is just so creepy and music is dark and sleek and pulls the song into a very strange dark and romantic feel.Bloody Mary - 8.5/10I liked the start alot loved the opening verse but the chorus killed it for me. I didn't like it very much and I felt like the feelings invoked in the chorus stray from the song. It goes from a dark song about refusal and love to a sort of solemn song about acceptance once it hits the chorus and then strays back again. I love the screams from Gaga though. Amazing.Bad Kids - 7/10A loud one that I kinda like but honestly it can get a little annoying and dull after a few plays in a row. However it's not a bad song overall and I like it enough.Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) - 9/10It gets an extra point for being called ""Highway Unicorn"". That just made me laugh out loud. Hard. Anyway the song... It's quite a good song. I love the lyrics and the music is really fun. It sounds like something I'd listen to when in a bad mood to channel my fury or so. I can't really explain that but I just like the emotions I get from it.Heavy Metal Lover - 8/10I actually really liked this one though I was kinda annoyed it was called ""Heavy Metal Lover"" and then didn't actually go very heavy. It just uses Bass. Alot of it. Which was pretty awesome anyway. A bit sexual but I care not.Electric Chapel - 8/10Cool song right off the bat. I love the riff from the guitar and the swelling orchestral accompaniment at the start and enjoyed the song alot. It's a mid-tempo beat which makes it pretty fun to hear and it's per usual for this album nicely dark.Yo&uuml; And I - 6/10I really didn't like this one much. It's a ballad but the music didn't fit it well. I honestly think it would have sounded a bit better without the bass twangs in the background. An acoustic guitar would have been nice as that would have fit the drums better. I love the lyrics and Gaga's voice however.The Edge of Glory - 9/10Good song - no! great song. Edgy dark fun and exciting. Gaga's voice is strong the lyrics are clever and the chorus is just begging to be screamed along with. Really great song.Overall - 8/10A strong album with a good beat good singing and good lyrics. It's not *amazing* per-say but it's definently worth buying. I greatly enjoyed it."
"Yes ""Born This Way"" is a blockbuster! Gaga does not disappoint as she shines through with yet another well-deserved stride to her place into superstardom. Her body of work on this CD exemplifies her God-given talents as a true maestro of music.Love her or hate her Gaga proves that she is one intelligently strong woman who can be rebelliously powerful with her genius lyrics and cleverly arranged music. Gaga steps beyond the boundaries of tradition and breaks the rules once again. Gaga was Born This Way to entertain the masses ... and she does it with excellence.Bravo!"
It's ok I got it for 99 cents so I can't complian.  I would'nt have paid over 2 bucks for it though.  I really only enjoy about three songs off the album.
"For an album that I couldn't help but purchase when I got the news that's it was out on the store for 99 cents this is well worth it. Better yet I should have got this for free. The title speaks for itself; every track is so good that it was hard for me to choose a favorite but if there is one track that tops them all it has to be Scheibe. However that's no knock to the other tracks like Highway Unicorn Americano Marry The Night. Now as good as this is I just wished that the Mother Monster would have convinced Amazon to sell the special edition for the same price because those of us who bought this album are (sort of) missing out on the extra goodies like Fashion of His Love. Then there are the remixes which take the ""awesomeness"" to a new level. I can see myself in the club dancing to the Scheibe remix. Either way with or without the bonuses the album is good. It's hard to believe Gaga is this powerful because I could relate to some of these songs too. For me this is the start of life as a little monster...By the way for some fans who compare Gaga to Britney Spears I must say that both artists are very good. They have totally different music backgrounds lifestyles and it's two artists who dominated two separates halves of the 2000s so there's no battle out here. BOTH are good!! You'll love every track ofFemme Fatale Deluxetoo!!"
"I loved Fame Monster. It had many great songs with hooks that sank deep on first listen. I listened to the cds for weeks on the way to/from work.Born This Way well its totally the opposite. The songs are just seriously weak compared to Gagas first album and if I never hear them again that is perfectly fine.I am not a Gaga fanboy/girl or what she calls a little monster. So I feel I can give you an ""unbiased"" opinion of ""Born This Way"". Just an average joe who really enjoyed her first album and really was disappointed in the second.That's my opionion. You may like it but again I state use the ""preview all samples"" button before you make a purchase."
it had to grow on me like most of her music but boy it has grown i love the whole album.
"I'm a very open minded man when it comes to music yes I even tried Lady damn Gaga due to all the hype surrounding it and well she delivers yet again another boring generic disc full of monstrosities (no pun intended). It's becoming quite apparent that her novelty is wearing off as even some of her most devoted fans are one starring this cd. One can't help but laugh at the cover. It's quite frankly the stupidest thing I've ever seen. She's just trying too hard now to be ""unique"" and ""different"". Sorry Lady Gaga but it's downhill from now on. Your crappy generic I'm so different pop nonsense novelty is wearing off.UPDATEHere's an article from yahoonews.Lady Gaga's Born This Way set another record this week but not one that Gaga's team will be happy about. Sales of the album dropped off by 84% from its sizzling (but discount-inflated) opening week. That's the the steepest drop-off in sales expressed in a percentage basis of any of the 17 albums that sold 1 million units in a week in Nielsen SoundScan history.Gaga's album sold 174000 copies this week down from 1108000 last week when sales were goosed by a two-day 99-cent sale at Amazon.The old record for the steepest drop-off following a million-unit week was held by *NSYNC's 2001 album Celebrity. Sales dropped by 76% in the week following its 1880000 debut. Two recent albums were tied for second place in the steepest drop-off column. Sales of Lil Wayne's 2008 hit Tha Carter III and Taylor Swift's 2010 smash Speak Now both dropped off by 69% in the week following their debuts of 1006000 and 1047000 respectively.A big drop-off was to be expected. But the fact that Gaga's drop-off was steeper than any of the other follow-ups to albums that had a million-unit week is troublesome. It seems obvious that the opening week tally for Born This Way was generated not only by hard-core fans but also by casual fans who just didn't want to pass up such a deal. Last week's near giveaway worked in the short term (by giving Gaga the biggest one-week sales total since 2005) but it may have also served to devalue albums in general and Gaga's brand in particular."

The Born this Way CD is incredible.  I purchased this set because I didn't have the remix or the DVD so it made sense.  I was hoping since the CD was stamped with a Parental Advisory Sticker that the Born This Way album would be unedited.  This album is still edited and it is the same CD that came with the Deluxe Edition upon its' first release.  Still an incredible album in the little cardboard sleeve that is now comes in (but does include the original booklet).  The mixes are ok and the DVD is ok.  Played them one time with all the new music and entertainment coming out this month.  Just wanted to write a quick review in case anyone was wondering if this is indeed an unedited Born this Way.  If I could do it all over since I already had the Deluxe edition I would have bought the Remix and DVD separately.  Way Sturdier packaging and if I got bored of the DVD I could have sold it on Amazon.
Just AWESOME! Really really very good. Great product great package design content... Unbelievable :) Everyone must buy it. I'm really happy.
"Well since I can't hear the entire album due to the fiasco with ""Cloud"" over this release I will review the 3 I was able to download but if these are similar to the rest I'll still hit my target. These so far sound like copies of other stuff music I have already heard from her.....seriously....NOTHING NEW HERE. I think her creative peak has been met and she has no more creative blood running through her veins. What I have heard so far is EXACTLY like her other stuff I mean I can almost sing her other stuff word for word with this supposed new stuff. Very disappointed but I'm glad it was only 99 cents as it is indeed Dollar Store material. This seems to happen with all artists who rocket to stardom too fast. They leave what creativeness they had behind as they shoot to stardom. If these few tracks are what gaga is putting out it is a sure sign that her creativeness is no longer with her. If there's any consolation.....most of her older stuff is still good."
I not even a Lady Gaga fan (I kinda hate her music honestly) but for 99 cents who can resist?  1 problem.  Where's the digital booklet most of this woman's success is attributed to her crazy imagery.  It's still worth it but a little disappointed.
Still can't figure out what the hype's all about. O wait marketing is the key to any artists success - she's a master at self promotion & marketing her work.
Love me some Gaga-this is one of my favotiate albums.  Had some trouble downloading it to my phone  but that's me.
I was only able to listen to half of the previews before I had to turn it off.  I had already listened to 4 of her songs including Born This Way and Judas and they all sucked.  The Fame was so much better than this.  She's changed her sound and is no longer as great as she used to be.  This is why so many singles have been released and why Amazon has this for 99 cents and why GaGa herself has said it is the album of the decade.  They are doing everything they can to make you buy this piece of crap.  If it was really that good they wouldn't have said or did any of these things.  99 cents in a good deal if you like one or two of the songs but quite frankly her and her label should be embarrassed.  What a letdown!
For those of you who do not like Lady GaGa then you want to skip buying this. For the little monsters that love her music and have a taste for something different then buy it. There's a mix of anger lust happiness and the tracks all range from something you want to dance to belting out in your car and not caring who hears you. There's something on this album for everyone.
WOW!  See there are some benefits to being in college for 10 years! lol best deal ever & took less then 3minutes minutes to save it to the cloud and download it to my itunes. DANCE PARTY STARTS NOW!
most amazing album ever. this is the first album i bought from gaga. this will be a classic for the next 1000 years.
I bought his when it was 99 cents...I like a few of her songs and thought I'd buy this... I like almost the whole album :)I've read other comments where people think she ripped off other songs... so? A good portion of everything today is ripped from someone / something. If you don't like it don't buy it :(
This Album is Amazing. The Beats are very intense and very loud. I Love The Meaning of this album. Being Free and Loving Who You Are.
Well I love the album its so different. SO far Im in love with:Born This Way: 1st Single it may be a copy t Madonna's express yourself but its fun to listen to it.Judas: Since i heard it I like the beat.Scheibe: Its so Euroelectro.. I dont speak German.. but i can if you want...cheow!Americano: The beat that starts wit it and the overall song.. good song.The Edge of Glory.. OMG that is my song! Love it!
For those of us who purchased this for .99 cents and got delayed downloading - sign in > go to My Account > scroll down PAST the Orders Payment and Settings to DIGITAL CONTENT > click MP3 Downloads > this takes you to another page called Your Media Library (may have to sign in again) > Click on the album picture > this should bring up the list of songs- click download > when prompted to Open or Save choose Open for .amz files - this should open that album downloader thingy and automatically start the download. > Paws Up!!Hope this helps you Lil Monsters!!!
This is the best album she has out by far and you dont have to skip a track like other albums out there!!
I love this album. I agree it's different than her previous albums but I still absolutely love it! Except one thing the album is censored!!!!! It never said it anywhere on the amazon description or even on the outside of the album package. I was really upset because I like to hear the unedited versions. This really is a complaint for amazon because it should be mentioned in the description very clearly. But I still love the songs!
"This is simply her best album yet it is much different than her other albums but it is still ""Gaga."" The beats are amazing and the vocals are so strong and beautiful. The lyrics make it even better its a very political album and focuses on many issues such as gay marriage immigration and freedom. All in all i think it is definitely one of the best albums this year and may very well be as Gaga said the album of the decade."
I like Born This Way quite a bit.  There's really very few artists in history who have been able to come up with 3 consecutive albums all of which contain multiple huge hits in them but Lady Gaga has already achieved that.  Strangely it's some of the songs that haven't hit the airwaves (yet) that I like best.  To me there are fewer songs that I like than the previous albums however so 4 stars instead of 5 for me.  Still a great effort.  And if she tours this album I'm sure I'll find myself going to that too.
"So after over six months of teasing Born This Way and no less than four singles released before the album itself Lady Gaga's second full-length album is finally upon us.  And what an album it is!  The woman formerly known as Stefani Germanotta has delivered a record so meticulously-crafted and so sonically energetic it's really difficult to know where to begin describing it.  Right off the bat it's important to note that this is NOT The Fame nor The Fame Monster.  Not by a long shot.  If you're expecting more ""Poker Face"" or ""Telephone"" you will be sorely disappointed...and I would feel sorry for you for not opening yourself up to this fantastic album.  Born This Way is a magnum opus a true pop masterpiece the likes of which is rarely seen nowadays.  With this album Lady Gaga has attempted to become more than what she was and it shows.  Born This Way is big it's bold it's a behemoth of a record that from start to finish pounds the listener with sonic overload.  But rather than being grating it's strangely alluring.  It's an album in the truest sense of the word and it's absolutely incredible.At its core Born This Way is a pop album.  But as it plays on it begins to morph into more.  From its strong opener the pounding ""Marry the Night"" the album doesn't slow down.  The first half of this 17-track special edition is an eclectic barrage of dark pop.  The raunchy ""Government Hooker"" gyrates and pulses with a sexy and sleazy beat and it's infectious.  ""Americano"" for as out-of-place as it seems with its Flamenco and Mariachi-inspired sound fits in extremely well with the rest of its collection.  ""ScheiBe"" is absolutely flawless sounding somewhat reminiscent of something from Fame Monster but so much darker.  Its pulsing beat just screams for a single release.  ""Bloody Mary"" slows things down but is still incredibly haunting and mesmerizing and features some excellent low vocals from Gaga.  And the bright ""Fashion of his Love"" stands out as one of my favorite songs on the album.  Yes it sounds like a modern-day interpretation of Whitney Houston's ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody"" but I honestly don't care.  This song gives me goose bumps and makes me seriously want to get up and dance around the room!From there the album shifts into and different direction...one dominated by glam rock 80's arena rock with hints of metal thrown in for good measure.  ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)"" resonates with a couple of Journey songs mashed together.  While the song has a very irregular pattern after a while you realize it's working really well.  ""Electric Chapel"" begins with raging electric guitars and the fury never lets up.  ""The Queen"" is an odd one melding two completely different rhythms into one song ending with an 80's electric guitar solo.  ""You and I"" which Gaga has performed live for the past few months sounds more evolved here.  Brian May of Queen joins Gaga in a song that's obviously inspired by that legendary band.  ""You and I"" is definitely a highlight of this album.  Finally the album culminates in the fantastic ""The Edge of Glory"" which is one of the finest endings an album could ever hope to get with its Pat Benatar-ish vocals saxophone solo and its haunting message.Obviously it goes without saying that Born This Way will be an extremely divisive album.  Lady Gaga began her career (and found enormous success) with your typical pop/dance sound.  The Fame was a great dance record.  It gave listeners something familiar but at the same time showed an exemplary level of sophistication and charisma.  The Fame Monster took that formula and made it even more unique.  Born This Way is a totally different animal altogether.  Because of this it's prone to being misunderstood.  Gaga has said that the album is more in line of what she's really capable of which implies that this is the album she's wanted to make and upon listening to it it's plainly obvious.  The album sounds as though Gaga has overseen every tiny aspect of its creation.  The result is one of the best pop albums to come around in a long time.  Born This Way is just as legendary as it was touted to be.  It is a pop masterpiece a true listening experience and completely worthy of belonging to the biggest new pop star of the decade!"
Honestly none of the songs are very memorable but it sounds slick and well-produced and ready for summertime playing. It's not going to sustain me through the whole summer though.
No idea if this album is any good or not 99 cents seems like a great price but thus far only 7 of the songs are available to play or download. Amazon really dropped the ball here. I'm sure they were hoping to poach all of Apple's cloud service potential customers before they rolled out their own cloud service but failures of this magnitude on such a huge release will end up costing them more customers than they would have gained. A for effort but I gotta give you a failing grade here. GaGa should sue.Update. 8 hours after writing this review I STILL have only 7 songs. For all the devout Gagites whining about people reviewing the service rather than the artist sorry but there is no place to register complaints about Amazon's failure to deliver the goods that were paid for and to warn others away from using said service other than reviews. Deal with it. I'm sure your idol will get plenty of money and I'm pretty sure defending her honor on Amazon is not going to get you a personal visit or anything so get a life.
"I'm not a hater. Lady Gaga can play all she wants. But this album is not edgy nor groundbreaking nor pushing boundries much nor taking chances nor hardcore nor great dance music. Beyond the singles Gaga pretty much just follows the same formula. Imitate some 90s techno synths water them down add some generic beats (for being a dance artist her beats are mostly oddly bland) and finish the song in an overproduced dense style with 80s pop style structure. Repeat over and over.Where is her evidence that she is a real singer songwriter like she claims not just a pop tart? Where is the groundbreaking or changing the pop lexicon? Lady Gaga doesn't take this opportunity to push herself or pop music. I suppose occasional gay culture references are supposed to be the edgy part. The ""Bad Romance""-ish ""Judas"" is probably the hardest thing here. Lady Gaga's beats are just boring. The cover of the Gaga motorcycle transformer is great thou."
This is an amazing example of how an artist can do 30 different genres in a single album. Some songs are just pure dance-pop records and others are revolutionary anthems that are ment to make a statement. People might hate this album because they cant handle the agressive truth it contains. It is really amazing how Gaga keeps pushing it and pushing it. Can't choose a favorite song because they are all so different they are all perfect in their way just like Lady Gaga!
It seems pointless to write extensive comments about a soul dominating eternal masterpiece.Although the previous albums hadn't impressed me much as a whole apart from the hit singles all the signs showed that a beyond belief monument of pop music was about  to arrive.Well it did!Lady Gaga didn't gain with this album the throne of the pop stardom; she had done so by the second album already.This time establishes herself as the undisputedly greatest pop icon of all time (I 'm in an age where I can remember all the previous ones...!)It took 30 years to find someone definitely capable to dethrone the previous queen (you can imagine who exactly I am refering to) but finally it's done!The queen is dead. Long live the queen !
"I ordered this CD as a Christmas present for a dear friend.  It arrived well before the ""needed by"" date and it was in excellent condition.  I would not hesitate to order from this site again in the future."
Any bad reviews for this album need to be ignored. The only way to really discover and appreciate this record's wonder is to listen to it! No matter what you thought of Lady Gaga before this time round it is SURE to be nothing but good things. Excellent album start to finish!
I wish I could review this album but amazon only made 2 songs available to me even though I paid for the whole album.This makes GaGa look like she's part of the rip off.  The two songs I got I don't care for.  If you plan on cheating people at least pick two good songs to cheat us with.  I am giving a poor rating based on the two garbage songs I did get to listen to.  They were awful could have been anyone singing these frumpy songs.  American idols reject songs I've heard better singing in karaoke bars.  GaGa goes country and loses her edge.  Yawn.
I'm kinda in the older generation and when I bought my first Lady Gaga cd my grand daughter was stunned.  So when I bought another &#34;Born this way&#34; I think I blew her mind.  Good music.
I LOVE this CD! It's perfect driving music. Perfect songs with great lyrics that take you on a wonderful journey! Way to Go Gaga!

I purchased the album today. The download was a bit slow but the entire album was downloaded in just under an hour. Not a bad wait for $0.99 and some good songs. No quality issues and I'm able to play them on all my media.There's a few misses on the album but overall I think it's a great listen. Not much out of the way of the usual Gaga-style but I guess that's why we have to wait for the music videos ;-)
for those who dont have a gaga collection this cd is perfect. good material and leaves nothing out. good music
"For little monsters around the globe the agonizing wait for Lady Gaga's new album which lasted for over eight months has finally come to an end with today's release of Born This Way her third album. (Don't gimme any of that ""it's her second album"" crap Wikipedia.The Fame Monsterwas promoted as her second and ever since you decided that that didn't count and started referring to BTW as her second all of the media outlets are doing so because they look to you for information which in turn makes it impossible to get a majority of reliable sources to say it's her third creating anInception-like self-fulfilling prophecy. Congratulations you're more powerful than the mainstream media. But I'm getting off topic.) Gaga promised that the wait would be well worth it that she had created the album of the decade that would move forward music and pop culture lightyears into the future. The hype train was so big and so strong starting with the release of Born This Way the single back in February and culminating in Gaga's SNL performance two days ago that you could have driven it through any international monument of your choosing and it would be crushed. As a gamer as well as an avid music lover it's easy to learn that when something is hyped up SO MUCH it's impossible to live up to that standard... and yet Gaga somehow managed to come damn close.In the interests of full disclosure I will say upfront that I am a devoted little monster who has been a fan of Gaga since Winter 2008. However despite this I will try to remain at least semi-objective for the purposes of this review. As you surely know Born This Way was released in bothstandardand expanded editions (Gaga dislikes the words ""deluxe"" and ""special"" hence the use of ""expanded"") however it seems almost redundant since everyone will spring for the expanded edition anyway. It contains three extra tracks of Gaga goodness as well as five remixes of varying quality (but more on that later). Whether standard or expanded though Gaga has completely shifted her mindset since The Fame Monster; while she opted for a ""less is more"" approach there she has since come to the realization that in fact ""more is more"" as Born This Way has twice as many tracks and is over twice as long as TFM. This is to say nothing of the content stylistically; The Fame Monster was about facing your demons but Born This Way is ultimately about loving yourself and everyone around you as well as getting a little dirty and dancing the whole night through.The album opens on a strong note with ""Marry the Night"" a power ballad which I think speaks of transforming yourself but still accepting qualities you don't like about yourself. This is followed by the instantly-recognizable title track which at this point you either really love or really hate whether or not you're a Gaga fan. It isn't any less inspirational or moving though and it somehow seems all new again listening to it with all the other songs on the album. Third track ""Government Hooker"" which is just begging to become a single is inspired by the affair between Marilyn Monroe and JFK. It's insanely catchy and danceable naughty but not totally raunchy (that comes later!). Next is the highly underrated (in my opinion) Judas which harkens back to the Bad Romance days of yore but still stands completely on its own. It still frustrates me that this will likely peak no higher than its debut position of #10 on the Billboard Hot 100 especially since Born This Way is now moving on to a third single closing track ""The Edge of Glory"" which I'll discuss in a moment.Following ""Judas"" is Gaga's political statement song ""Americano"" which is a criticism of America's immigration policy and since she sings of falling in love with an illegal girl probably gay marriage as well. Don't be surprised if this ends up getting released as a single either; not only does it have a great message but it's one of the highlights of the album. Of course a highlight in an album of highlights may sound like I'm being redundant but you get what I mean. ""Hair"" Born This Way's other pre-release promo single is a song of freedom and independence which has been likened to Katy Perry's ""Firework"" and Pink's ""Fu**ing Perfect."" ""Hair"" however drops all pretense of a cheesy empowerment message masquerading as seriousness by driving things into even more outrageous territory proudly declaring ""I am my hair!"" And as some may have seen at her Monster Ball tour she totally means that (those who saw will know what I'm talking about). The next song is one that was first premiered at the Mugler menswear fashion show several months ago in a remixed version and those concerned about its quality then (myself included) can rest easy now that the album version of ""ScheiBe"" has been released. (I don't know how to do that fancy symbol so a capital B will have to do.) Gaga basically sings that she's going to be as brash bad and unapologetic as she wants all the time and encourages all other women to do the same not just on the dance floor. She also manages to beat Madonna at her own ""spoken word verses in a song"" game which you'll have to listen to to understand. I'm a big Madonna fan as well as Gaga and I don't like making comparisons between the two but still Madge got owned. ""Justify My Lovesounds weak in comparison and that was spoken the entire song and not just the hook! ""Bloody Mary"" is arguably the most haunting and utterly creepy song Gaga has ever done easily beating the macabre subliminal message of ""Paparazzi"" or the voodoo-inspired ""Teeth"" from her last two albums. She starts out wailing like a ghost first somewhat tempered and then just all out screaming while singing in an almost monotone of things such as death and unrequited love while also managing to reference the Bloody Mary ghost of legend the Virgin Mary Mary Magdalene and possibly all murder victims named Mary in history. In case you hadn't noticed by now or will notice in songs to come religion is a recurring theme on the album; Gaga is a devout Catholic but also openly condemns organized religion for creating intolerance bigotry and hate.Speaking of religion next up is ""Black Jesus + Amen Fashion"" one of the bonus tracks on the expanded edition. Interestingly instead of putting the albums bonus tracks all at the beginning of the album (as with Taylor Swift's ""Fearless: Platinum Edition"") or all at the end (as with well everyone else) the three studio tracks are inserted at various points in the standard track listing which is actually quite cool. It's at this point that the albums starts to fall into something of a short semi-lull. ""Black Jesus"" lyrically is all over the place and while according to her ""it's about how putting on a new spirit is as easy as putting on fashion"" I can't say I would've gotten that from listening to it. Actually come to think of it I have no idea what she's talking about. Despite my ignorance the song is still quite catchy and is growing on my somewhat but I have to wonder if something more worthy was left on the cutting room floor. Its immediate successor is the other contributor to the semi-lull ""Bad Kids."" The lyrics are good but they're totally incongruous to the melody. Something harsher or more industrial sounding would have worked much better; instrumentally it seemed like it belonged closer to Gaga's now-famous unicorn than it did a soundtrack for society's rebels. Of course rebel unicorns might disagree with me. To digress slightly for a moment it seems as though Gaga was polishing and retooling this album right up to the eleventh hour (maybe even the eleventh second of the eleventh minute of the eleventh hour etc) as some of the lyrics in the booklet don't match the songs themselves. I'm not just talking about the usual spelling error or omission of a word some verses will be differently worded completely and in some cases outright missing. I bring this up now because this is especially true for ""Bad Kids""... it's missing an entire chunk of lyrical content in which Gaga gets into a fight with a cop basically tells him to screw off insults him demeans him and best of all makes a reference to her famous meat dress. Based on the missed potential alone I have to mark down points on this song even if it wasn't so oddly misplaced to begin with. I know it sounds like I totally tore these songs new ones (if they even had ones to begin with) but they're still ultimately 3.5-4 star songs while all the other songs on this album are closer to 4.5-5 stars (all out of 5).The second of the three bonus tracks comes next ""Fashion of His Love"" which was inspired by and is a tribute to Gaga's dear friend the late Alexander McQueen. It's actually quite touching despite being an upbeat dance song. I would imagine McQueen is dancing to it in Heaven. ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)"" which ultimately gave us the awesome standard edition cover art of the Gagacycle is a somewhat slower song while still having some energy to it which paints a picture of a biker gang chasing an ideal love on their other love their bikes. I really like this song it's one of my favorites for some reason and that's saying something since I'm so totally in love with almost every song on this album. ""Heavy Metal Lover"" is the aforementioned raunchy track on the album which by comparison makes ""LoveGame"" and its disco stick look fairly tame. It's one of the more humorous songs on Born This Way because without the slightest hint of irony it speaks of a gang bang with a bunch of biker dudes. Really. In some ways you could consider it something of a counterbalance to ""Highway Unicorn"" actually. Interestingly the song following this is ""Electric Chapel"" an ethereal electronic track in which Gaga plays coy with her lover and teases him with promises of possible sex before finally becoming a bit more brazen. The third and final bonus track is ""The Queen"" which is surprising simply because such a great song wasn't chosen for the standard edition (however useless I think that version might be). She takes her mantra of ""don't be a drag just be a queen"" to heart here building herself up when others try to tear her down asserting that she is powerful (and dare I say the future Queen of pop?). The penultimate track is the already familiar ""Yo&uuml; and I"" which Gaga added to the setlist of her tour in its last eight months or so. Though not quite as acoustic-sounding as in her live performances it's still a relatively stripped track that's just as powerful and amazing as a studio version with just a hint of country amidst her otherwise old-school rock-and-roll sound. Finally everything culminates with ""The Edge of Glory"" the already classic track and third single which... oh words can't really describe it. If you've heard this song you know what pure and utter pop magic it is. Almost certainly destined to become one of those timeless pieces that will be sung for generations to come by people who didn't even really know or appreciate who Lady Gaga was in the years prior.So Born This Way proper is nothing sort of a masterpiece; a veritable pop opus that rises above her last two albums. However with all masterpieces there are still flaws; minor but still hard to overlook given the quality of the piece. The first of these is the five remixes included with the expanded edition. First up is ""Born This Way (The Country Road Version)"" which firmly establishes the fact that Gaga is hellbent on pioneering the ""electrocountry"" genre. While nothing can compare to the original in my mind the quality of it is still just as good and to hear a different take on it is quite refreshing. Unfortunately things go downhill from here. The next track is ""Judas (DJ White Shadow Remix)"" DJ White Shadow of course being one of the primary producers of the album. Since Judas is such an amazing pop song to begin with any attempt to change it seems destined to end in at least mediocrity and at most disaster. This falls somewhere between the two extremes fine for what it is but still utterly unremarkable. ""Marry the Night (Zedd Remix)"" starts out sounding as though it's just a dancified version of the album version but you soon find it strips away all of the brilliant lyrics in favor of some rather grating beats which sound like an auto-tuned Kayako Saeki the ghost from theGrudgemovies. This is followed by ""ScheiBe (DJ White Shadow Mugler)"" which is the version of ""ScheiBe"" that first debuted. Unfortunately it's not the version you saw on Lady Gaga's YouTube channel that you became accustomed to in the months leading up to the album release; instead it's what was presumably the uncut version played at the fashion show itself clocking in at a whopping nine-and-a-half minutes. That's a good length for a music video provided it's something like ""Telephone"" but not for a remix and a rather boring one at that which doesn't compare to just playing the album version three times in a row. The remixes end on a better note with ""Fashion of His Love (Fernando Garibay Remix)"" who was also one of the primary producers on the album taking the already dancy and memorable song and making it even more of an invitation to get on the dance floor. I still prefer the album version to this but it's still a quality remix that warrants repeat listening.So only two out of the five bonus remixes are worth it. That's it? Not like that really matters that's not why you got the expanded edition to begin with! Well that's not the only problem. The one truly bad part of Born This Way is the censorship. Yes even after the huge uproar that little monsters caused worldwide over The Fame Monster having its curse words censored Interscope has gone and done it AGAIN. The first song affected by this is ""Government Hooker"" however instead of the usual silencing of the word distorting it or playing it backwards there was a loud bleeping sound like what you might expect on TV (or 2/3 of an episode ofJersey Shore). At first I thought that this was intentional Gaga perhaps referencing Watergate or the government's general tightlippedness but this kept happening in later songs albeit without the bleeps. All in all five of the seventeen songs are affected including the aforementioned ""Government Hooker"" as well as ""ScheiBe"" ""Bad Kids"" ""Heavy Metal Lover"" and ""The Queen"" in most instances the censored word being sh** or b**ch (both of which might I add were uncensored when uttered on Gaga's debutThe Fame). While I find this inexcusable and I would hope that Interscope makes amends immediately I would urge you not to deprive yourselves of such an incredible album due to this. Yes it's annoying and yes it never should have happened but this album is too great to miss.Ultimately Gaga has done what no one thought she could do: top herself and live up to the hype she and her little monsters created. This is an album I intend to keep on repeat 24/7 for at least the next month with frequent listens afterwards. Gaga can do no wrong simply because she doesn't know how (the subpar ""Eh Eh"" video notwithstanding). I would overall rate this a 9.5/10 simply because A) I don't give out 10/10s (since nothing's completely perfect) and B) because there are a few minor flaws (and one major one). What are you waiting for?"
Sadly the record is censored. I don't think many small children will be purchasing and playing vinyl like this at least not without the help of their parents.The cover and sleeves were nicely designed and aside from the censorship the records are fine.
This is a lifetime keeper It went right onto my ipod... always being playing.*I am not under 67 yrs old.
Some powerful catchy tunes with impeccable studio effects.Definitely a top entertainer who continues to creativelyexperiment. Tracks 10 and 14 rock.
"This album perfectly mixes techno industrial rock and electronic dance pop music with heavy 80's and 90's influences. Their are great guest artists on this record including Clarence Clemons who plays sax perfectly in ""Edge of Glory"" and ""Hair."" Guitarist from queen sets in on Gaga's song ""You and I."" The songs are a different step for Gaga with (at times cheesy) but more meaningful lyrics. Some songs are comedic and theatrical like Bloody Mary which is a spooky pop record and ""Americano"" which is a Mexican inspired dance track about gay marriage and involves her in a lesbian relationship with a girl in east LA. Some songs are inspirational like ""Born This Way"" which gives a shot out to the gay community who she loves and respects. ""Schie&szlig;e"" is a German inspired acid house dance track with European flair this is my favorite track on the album. Some filler songs for me are ""Bad Kids"" and ""The Queen."" ""Fashion of His Love"" is a callout to the great music of the late 80's and gives a mention to the late McQueen who designed Gaga outfits in some of her videos and performances overall a very fun song. The album closes with an emotional but upbeat song with great lyrics and a great inspirational melody with ""Edge of Glory"" which is a great album closer. I highly recommend buying this album it is great to dance too :) and Gaga continues to grow as an artist and she really cares about her fans."
I was really excited about this deal -- and I was thinking about purchasing a copy for my girlfriend in addition to purchasing my own.  However I can only access six of the songs on my cloud drive so I don't think I'll be purchasing another copy.  The other songs appear in my cloud but I'm unable to download or even play them.  I have never before had a problem with Amazon's MP3 sales until now.
I LOVE LADY GAGA! LITTLE MONSTERS FOREVER!!!!!!!!!! Lol anyways about the CD I loved loved loved it! I had it pre-orderd form the day you could and i had that day deleviery. I have no regrets about that. The album is FANTASTIC i love every song on it. I've listend to it like a hundred times ont he fist day i got it. The cover art is beautiful like the songs. Everyone deserves this. BEST BUY EVER for this product. :D
I just purchased this item for $0.99 and got what I paid for... only 2 songs from the album are available to listen/downloadHair and Highway Unicorn are the only playable songs at this time.Updated:  They fixed it the massive demand overloaded servers... changed my rating from 1 to 5 stars as I can sympathize with this issue.
"On Amazon and the cloud player: I appreciate the great price for the entire album. I am still working with customer support to complete my download but all the songs are in my cloud player now. I love Amazon's website and the idea of the cloud music storage system. Every time I use a horrible storefront website like Dell or bad software like itunes I appreciate Amazon more. However I bet in a year from now Amazon is going to have a mess with this ""free"" year of 20GB turning into a $20/year bill.On Lady Gaga and Born this Way: I really like the song ""You and I"".  This is not Madonna like. There is a Queen hook in there but it's not Queen like either.  I understand the comparisons to Madonna but I believe that Lady Gaga is a better musician. I love to hear Lady Gaga sit and play piano and sing. There is a lot of talent beyond her being a student of pop culture.I do not think this idea of Lady Gaga encouraging acceptance of one's genuine self is a little thing.  I think there are obviously lots of young people who long to be accepted as they work to be different. It's a paradox. Ultimately Lady Gaga is a genius. You don't get this popular without a mad plan and a good brain. If part of her evil master plan is to be the champion of a generation of GLBT and otherwise odd ball youth then I say good on her."
EVERYBODY!!! Please calm the FRACK down! This is Lady Gaga were talking about! Yes there are technical issues and glitches with the cloud player & downloading app! Remember though you paid just .99 for an ENTIRE ALBUM! The most important thing IS you've locked in this amazing price! Amazon will make it right and you WILL get your music! If you want it in your hot little hands so bad then may I suggest you go to your nearest brick & mortar shop and pay the FULL retail price like a TRUE FAN would otherwise just take a breath and go listen to the full songs on youtube! Giving this album a 1 star review because of a technical bottleneck is unfair to the artist!PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE!!!
The cd is really cool!Bought as a gift to a friend!The product is very good quality!Highly recommend to all!Thank you!
Amazon your site is available world-wide. The promotions for this deal are being seen world-wide. Why aren't you providing this offer world-wide? I would very much like to buy this album but refuse to pay over ten times more just because of where I happen to live.  So I came to the site to get an album but came away with nothing. One star.
"What began as a failed military project Weyland-Yutani Corporation's LGG (or ""Lady GaGa"" as it is called) ""Scorched Earth"" weapons platform became one of the company's big sellers at the 2011 International Cybernetics Convention (ICC) this past month.How did Andrew Weyland turn this multi-billion dollar debacle into a hot seller? I had an opportunity to ask Mr. Weyland during the convention: ""After the infamous 'meat-suit' disaster (The Mark 9 LGG malfunctioned during a routine systems test - deafening 10 technicians killing three and covering itself with their remains) we thought that it was a total wash. But we had some very brilliant people work on a new more powerful sound generating platform a better targeting system and a more radical bio-covering. We then re-packaged the Mark 10 aiming at a younger less sophisticated market and priced it to move.""And ""move"" it did. Sales for the Mark 10 Ga-Ga have soared. Recent tests continue to be very promising. Ga-Ga's Nagouchi MX34 sound generation system combined with the standard auto-tune hardware can cut through a three inch block of steel in less than 3 seconds! Surprisingly playback of the sound is almost as effective; causing small animals to literally explode. Also the bio-covering alone is enough to break the morale of an attacking force truly frightening.Although some critics have called the Mark 10 LGG a ""cheap tawdry pointless and lacking any real value"" and ""the ugliest sounding thing around"" sales continue to be very good for this item. But Weyland-Yutani is not content to rest on their laurels. Their new press release indicates that the LGG Mark 11 will be debuting sometime next year. There seems to be no stopping this sales juggernaut."
I have always been a fan of Lady GaGa and I pre-ordered this album as soon as I heard the release date (forgot to write a review until now). Gaga outdid herself again! Yes it is much different than her old music and some do not like it but that is what is great about GaGa she as an artist transforms herself and her music. I listened to this album non-stop for a good month it is just so addicting! If you are debating on buying the album or not just do it you will NOT regret it!
I liked this CD when I first got it-not loved until I played it several times and some of the songs I did not like then I love now and are my favorites! Including Scheibe and You and I(this is a classic tribute to Shania Twain/Mutt Lange of years past).Excellent hooks great beat and just plain fun!Enjoy!
I love this album!  I especially love the song Born This Way because it encourages me to have pride face and overcome my fears and remember that I was born this way baby!
What a great rare deal - a full top 40 album for $.99?! Be still my beating heart.  I would take another deal like this any day (read: do this AGAIN Amazon!) And I wouldn't have bought this album otherwise.  Thanks!
This album is like a little bit more rock than her previous one The Fame Monster. Includes darker songs but still have that GaGa music we all know. As a GaGa fan I like it but I really expected more personally.
I purchased this digital album solely because it was on sale for .99 cents. I'm a pop music collector of hits and the single for Born This Way was hitting #1 on the charts so I made the purchase. The entire album just didn't do it at all for me even tho I loved her debut with Just Dance being one of my favorite songs of the 2000s decade. And many others songs on that first album being extremely catchy. I don't think there is one single that I like off this Born This Way album. Definitely a disappointing followup.
The album truly is almost a holy anthem of a new generation of humans beings and people. amazing. I have bought it and recieved it as a gift from friends they know I love it so much.
This album is much more than just fun music it's music with a message. Feeling down? Listen. Feeling left out? Listen. Feeling like you're a loser? Listen. There are so many uses for this music rather than just a good time. It's worth a listen and a buy.
Took me almost an hour of retrying to get the whole album downloaded.  I got so fed up I didn't even have time to listen because it took so long to get it completed. Not a very good showing for my 1st try at the Amazon service.
Simply a great album. Unlike many 'pop' artist Lady Gaga has a powerful and beautiful voice. Born this Way does not disappointed. Her growth as an artist from The Fame to Born this Way is remarkable.
Purchased this digital music during an Amazon promotion and can't beat the price for this Lady Gaga collection of music.
Lady Gaga has outdone herself again! I absolutely love this new album and how she made it for her fans! Born This Way is my favorite!
A couple of years ago I wasn't a fan of Lady Gaga at all. I didn't understand the hype and all. Then one of my friends convinced me to watch a couple of videos. One was Bad Romance and the other was Paparazzi at the VMA's where she's covered in blood and hangs herself in the end. After watching that I became an instant fan. I realized her voice is absolutely fantastic and that she pretty much always sings live unlike some other artists plus her voice is to die for! After that I got the Fame Monster album and fell in love with it. And now....she's made the best album I've heard in about 12 years releasing Born This Way. The BTW album is a huge step up from The Fame Monster. It shows a woman who's really grown music wise and this is what she's made to do - sing rock!! I am totally in love with this whole album. This one really comes from her heart. The awards are going to pour all over her for this album I know it. You can clearly hear some Bowie influences in this album. Several months ago I heard snippets of Sheibe and Government Hooker and knew they would be totally amazing and finally after listening to them I can say that they absolutely blow my mind. No bubblegum pop for this woman anymore - this is what her voice is made for. I give this album 10/10. I haven't heard anything this mind blowing in 12 years. She's shown that she's here to stay.
Not as good as Fame/ Fame Monster it almost sounds like she's trying too hard to keep her fan's attention. I originally only wished to purchase one song from this album but at 99 cents how could I resist? At least the price makes up for the disappointment in the rest of the album AND the 8-hour download time.
Thank you Amazon for the amazing deal!!  Wow I can't believe Lady Gaga's entire new album was $.99.  Yes it took one day to get everthing to download  but it was well worth the wait.  Thanks everyone for the reviews yesterday so I knew why this wasn't downloading.
"Remember Lauryn Hill's ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill""? remember Alanis Morissette's ""Jagged little Pill""? remember Madonna's ""Ray of Light""? remember Miles Davis's ""Kind of Blue"" remember the Beatles's ""Rubber Soul"" what happened to the ""Artists"" those great people who had a vision and went with it those who had a voice and could just SING the ones who were ground-breaking and inspiring and most importantly ""ARTISTIC"" and ""CREATIVE"" is this what people like to listen to now? Lady gaga is the EXACT OPPOSITE of good music she sings about government hookers and stupid sexual metaphors and she doesn't really SING the same goes for so many FAKE artists of today(Like Kesha Katy perry Justin Bieber etc.) and really we all now she can't sing if it weren't for her stupid (and Sometimes retarded) outfits and her constantly mentioning that she supports gay rights (No DisrespectI know tons of gay people ;p) she would be much less famous yes it's a fact we live in a world were people love gaga for what she wears and who she supports (lots of people did admit it) her voice is not that good and is taken and processed through lots of synthesizers and computers she is PURELY Generic dance-pop plus let's face it she's doing blasphemy and when someone does something so stupid like that it officially makes them an uncreative singer she thinks she can do whatever she wants regardless of wether she's doing it for her fans or to gain more money you can't defend her or support her for that it makes me mad that there are less famous artists these days who are SO much more talented and inspiring than her and deserve her popularity her fame and her money YOU WANT GOOD MUSIC? listen to Michael Jackson (of course) The Beatles Aretha Franklin Etta James Aaliyah Jazmine Sullivan Elvis Presly Lauryn Hill Norah Jones Alanis Morissette Frank Sinatra P!nk Stevie Wonder Alicia Keys AC/DC Ani DiFranco Sia Michael Buble Janelle Monae Pink Floyd salt-n-pepa Bob Marley Don't say I've only included oldies singers I mentioned lots of ""new"" artists also there are tons of other great dance artists out there Like Kaskade Robyn Etc. -Liza.h"
As a HUGE gaga fan you might think e bias but this album doesn't disappoint. It has a bit of 90's 80's pop rock dance industrial all cooked into an awesome album by our sweet mother monster. if you are even a casual pop or Gaga fan you will find something interesting. Lyrically and musically this album shows a growth in Gaga and even a very experimental side which I good!
"It seems lady gaga has now thought it was time to release a new record but what a shock this album ""Born This Way"" is an abomination on music as well as her other previous albums she has brought nothing new to her fans or to the others who could potentially in time become fans. This album has brought the same old formula dance electro pop beats and a weak production on set without any thought put behind the music or lyrics how people think she's creative and diverse is beyond me in short if your looking for real pop singers or singer song writers i'd recommend artist's like linda ronstadt lisa loeb amy jo johnson and tracy chapman to name a few and stay away from gaga she's trash at it's finest giving birth musically to such abomination as these jessie j rihanna katy perry nicki minaj and ke$ha = trash"
"Like many other Little Monsters I downloaded this today with much glee and anticipation. However that glee ceased when I got to the song ""Government Hooker"" and realized that this content is censored. Nowhere in the product description is this noted. Had I known this I would have paid full price for it on iTunes. If you believe in free speech and freedom of expression DO NOT buy this CENSORED version and let Amazon know your feelings."
"While I was at first skeptical of the album's premise I was immediately sold once I listened to it. Most of the songs are beautiful and quite catchy. Don't stray away from the songs that aren't singles either I think that two of the best tracks are ""Electric Chapel"" and ""Bloody Mary"" both of which haven't been released as singles. Altogether a good cohesive album!"
Lady gaga's music is redundant and not very good. I bought this to listen to a few of her singles but they have no staying power and im sick of hearing them alrsady. I only bought this for the amazon discount price of 99. Shouldve got britney spears album instead.
"I am in love with this album and Lady Gaga. I have loved all her albums. As for those who say its too ""different"" why would you want just more of the same? You could hear her evolving just from The Fame to The Fame Monster. She is refining her music and her art without losing what shot her to fame to begin with. The songs on this album are just great. At first I wasn't sure what I thought of Judas. The more I listened to it the more I loved it. The Edge of Glory is awesome. I have yet to listen to the album version of You and I but I saw her perform it live and it was the most incredible song. Just Gaga and her piano (it was on fire of course). This woman is incredibly talented.As for the 99 cent download it is working just slowly. Just be patient! Totally worth it!"
This morning I was very bummed because i knew I would not be able to get Born this Way thanks to my broke college student status. However amazon kindly emailed me to let me know they were selling it FOR ONLY 99 CENTS!! I jumped on that offer asap! After reading to make sure that it was the entire album and that it would be playable in itunes I went ahead and bought it.Apparently the download is not working for people now or is very slow. I downloaded my album today at 4pm EST and it seriously only took about 3 minutes... I think it might have been before the major traffic came but still I think the bad dl times are just a fluke thanks to Lady Gaga's popularity. I wouldn't recommend writing off amazon just because of this especially since the price can't be beat!  Anyway the album is great and it was super super easy to put it in my itunes folder and onto my iphone. I'm definitely going to check out amazon's prices before dl-ing from itunes for music in the future! Thank you amazon!!
The server issues on amazon shouldn't affect the quality of the review for this album. We love Lady Gaga and are enjoying this album. It did take hours to download but it was worth it for the $.99 price!
CD was received by recipient in perfect condition.  It was a Christmas present and product was shipped quickly.  Great CD!
Who buys cds anymore anyway?! My songs finished downloading in no time and for .99c even if they didnt I could have waited. Put your paws up for Amazon for the dirt cheap price for such an amazing album and for Mother Monster thanks for another amazing album!
There is a note saying they are experiencing problems and all songs will be downloaded they all show in my Latest Purchases but give them time for it to show in your playlist.
Lady Gaga has done it again. She released a great new set of songs and this will not disappoint if you are a Lady Gaga fan. Great to workout to at the gym.
I would have given this 5 stars if the download was reliable. I tried to purchase this yesterday for 99 cents and thought I didn't get any songs since it said it failed. I find today that I have 11 songs but where are the last 3 including Electric Chapel. Maybe they should have thought it through before teasing everyone with this download and then failing to meet expectations.
"Only one song and the digital booklet downloaded.  The rest show in the cloud player but are not accessible to play there or download.  The order is not showing as completed so I have no way to contact Amazon about this error.  This ""bargain"" is going to turn out to be a lot of aggravation!"
"Dear Sirs AmazonJust to inform you that I purchased with Lady Gaga's CD ""Born This Way"" and I arrived at my home in padded envelope with the box but totally crashed this due to the lack of a rigid packaging to protect the CD.The reference order is 103 - 8013469 - 1048252"
"This album is such a triumph. Lady Gaga has reinvented her own sound and it's better than ever. Although she hasn't strayed too far it's still extremely fresh and interesting. A much ""fuller"" sound with deep rock influences but still holding on to that dance-y electro Gaga that we all know and love. Lyrically and sonically this album is genius and I don't have a single complaint. I would recommend this album to ANYONE. There is AT LEAST one or two tracks that everyone is sure to love. (ALSO - let me add - the album itself is so gorgeous. From the booklet to the case it's such a nice design and quality with photographs that I often look at.)"
I have respect for any artist who can be true to themselves and works hard to create an album of originality in both sound and lyrics.  And although conceptually and lyrically some originality exists in Lady GaGa's latest album the entire sound composition and overbearing repetitive techno vibe make the entire album fall flat overall.  Sigh....was expecting so much more and I can see why they launched this album with a special promo price of 99 cents.  It's barely worth that :(
This album is the best thing that has came out in my lifetime.The length is perfect and each song is a masterpiece!Also the album artwork is to die for!
This almbum is so amazing what it feels when you listen to it is fantastic you get to feel good about yourself with those strong lyrics you feel free and most importat the message it left is just a art and I love it! I love Lady GaGa!
The album definitely exceeded my expectations and the fact that it was only $0.99 made it even cooler! I think everyone should buy this album even if you're not a Lady Gaga fan! Chances are you'll like at least one song on this album and the price for one song on iTunes is as much as $1.29!At first I was a bit cautious about purchasing this because I knew that it was going to be in the Cloud. In other words the music would be available on the internet and it wouldn't be on your computer taking up space (like your iTune's Library). After pressing the purchase button I realized that I could have just added all of the songs to my YouTube playlist and saved a dollar. However Amazon's Downloader allows for us to download the songs onto our computers and into our iTunes library which can later be placed on portable devices!This is not a gimmick! Buy it while the offer lasts!
"Confession: I am not the world's biggest Lady Gaga fan. I enjoy some of her songs particularly The Fame Beautiful Dirty Rich and Just Dance. But I don't like the style of Telephone Alejandro Poker Face or LoveGame. They all start to sound like the same song in my mind after awhile.My main complaints with Lady Gaga are that she seems to have quite the ego in interviews; the larger-than-life hype surrounding her is not justified by the just-ok talent; and she borrows extensively from other artists without bringing more of her own originality into the game. Also while I appreciate her aligning herself with the LGBT community her claim that she is bisexual while never having been in love with another woman rings suspicious. Of course we all know Madonna pulled this same schtick with Sandra Bernhard many years ago.All that being said this was 99 cents and I really liked Judas so I was going to go for it.The album is divided into a few different kinds of songs.There's ""The Fame Monster""-era danceable Lady Gaga represented by Judas Sheibe Bloody Mary Bad Kids Heavy Metal Lover Electric Chapel (although that does have a heavy metal opening). It is no coincidence that these are some of the best songs on the album (minus Bad Kids). Dance is what Gaga does best and what she should stick with. The problem on this album is she is straddling too many genres genres she shouldn't be messing with in an effort to prove herself. You can do a lot sticking to just dance music. Ask the Pet Shop Boys sometime.Beyond the dance music there's Pat Benatar-style BIG 80s rocking with Marry the Night Hair Highway Unicorn and The Edge of Glory. Marry the Night is very catchy as is Edge of Glory but Gaga sounds wrong singing them. Again she's meant for dance music. Also these songs sound DATED. It's one thing to borrow from the past but update it a little bit bring something new to it. Don't just copy in a paint-by-numbers way of a genre that wasn't that great to begin with.You and I is a country song and it is well-done but again this is something Taylor Swift should be singing. Gaga should never do country. NEVER.You know Born this Way already. I really dislike that song. The message is positive but the song is just so play-it-safe boring.Americano rips off Rosemary Clooney of all people as one reviewer noted. It's Greek/Israeli-style music that is just nonsense and should have been cut. No one could have made this work.Overall the best songs are Judas SheiBe Bloody Mary Heavy Metal Lover and Electric Chapel. If she had released just these five songs she would have had a hit on her hands.Lyrically speaking the album also suffers. Born this Way has strong songwriting as does Judas ScheiBe Americano and You and I. But Hair and Bad Kids are so unintelligent it's just ridiculous.Full disclosure: I am still awaiting the download of Goverment Hooker so I cannot review it yet. But even if that song is wonderful it doesn't make up for the uneveness of this CD. As another reviewer said Gaga needs to spend more time on the next album and don't load an album down with 14 tracks that vary in quality when eight strong tracks would be just fine."
For all the one-star folks jumping ship just to get it a bit faster...hello McFly!?! Right go ahead support other locations when it is simply download overload...you tried didn't ya? Be patient you'll get the sorry album soon enough but I spent 99 cents just to get a chance at calling the whiners out. Worth more than the album itself as I can't stand this lunatic and her screechy voice. Just wanted to add the 5-star to the cause of bringing album prices down and support a company that's tryng its best to take care of YOU the customer.
I recived it quickly and it was in great condition! Have listened to it a few times already!  Was a great price and prompt transaction!
Changing my review from 1 star to 4. more than 3 hours later the album's more than 90% downloaded. what has downloaded so far is amazing and i'm really happy :)
I've been following @AmazonMP3 on Twitter for a while. A day or two before the Gaga release they were sending hinting Tweets about it. Shortly after midnight on Monday they Tweeted that the entire album was available for $0.99. I bought it. It went to my cloud. Less than a minute later I was listening to it. I like the album and the service was fast and easy.
Just give me Lady Gaga and Leonard Cohen music and I am a happy person. So talented and she is always changing it up so you don't get bored with the same oldsame old sound.
Although there was a little bit delay in getting the alblum because of Amazon's cloud issue it was worth the wait. It was a pretty good album and definitely showed a new side of Lady Gaga. pretty sure a few will hit the chart!
I was concerned about getting this because of all the technical issues that people described but although it may be a little on the slow side (and I can appreciate that given the millions of people that must be downloading at this price) it is definitely worth the wait.  I have about 7 songs in 45 minutes and it is still going at a resonable pace. The songs I have played so far are amazing the audio is superb.  This is a great deal!
Paid $7 for the album because Amazon servers went down from the huge demand when it was on sale for $1. The album is okay.
I saw this while looking around for products to buy.$1.00 and I had to buy it. Normally an album can range from $10-15 dollars depends on the store.Lady Gaga has some good songs in this album. I wish her other albums were cheap so I can buy it.5/5 Stars
"Lady Gaga has pulled out all the stops for Born This Way - she leaves nothing on the table or nothing behind and gives her everything. The album is not typical in many respects of her previous work and I think it is somewhat more polarizing than anything else she has previously done; e.g. either you'll love it or hate it but I don't think you'll be stuck somewhere in between. The good news is that this is a change a different direction - were any of us really ready for Bad Romance part 2? I don't think so and on that note Lady Gaga surely delivers. She's giving us multiple messages in this release messages that not all of us will understand or are ready for which is not to say it's over anyone's head but it really is new territory for her. She has changed gears and we really are lucky that she has. She delivers again a tour de force that should demand respect from even the most critical ear. As a musician artist and person she has evolved; luckily we get to hear that.So far even my own family (some of us are a bit old to be called ""monsters"" but we get the drift) is polarized over this release - my 70+ year old and very coherent mother loves it especially her voice and the range and she was clear about some of the messages being sent out; me a 50 year old father of two teen girls loves it - one of my teens the 15 year old can't get enough yet the 13 year old doesn't like any part of it not at all and prior to this album had been a huge Lady Gaga fan. Like I said this music is polarizing - and even among friends I've checked with there is no in between.Well that's my take on it and quite frankly I hope you do actually preview the songs before buying it to see if it is in your taste range or not; even better yet - watch her Monster Ball Concert at Madison Square Garden before opting to buy it. Me? I can't get enough of it and for that reason have made the purchase for it.One last note - to those reviewers who bash the musician (1 star? please!) because they had problems downloading the album - 1. Really? You gave the album 1 star because you couldn't download it fast enough? Is it me or is that a bit oxymoronic?; 2. Really? You gave the album 1 star because you have internet or network problems and don't take it up with Amazon or your cable provider but take it out on the musician? - that's just childish it really is. For me it took a little over 5 minutes but this album is worth the wait. Giving this 1 star because you had problems downloading it is like shooting your mail carrier because you don't like the mail they deliver and is really really dumb."
I'm not much of a mainstream fan but there's some *mainstream* artists that I like listening to once and a while. Well if you're going to turn the radio stations *ON* it's very difficult *NOT* to listen to Lady Gaga. Not just on radio stations in fact even on TV shows in bars clubs parties and regular restaurants even. Lady Gaga songs are just everywhere and as with her previous albums The Fame & The Fame Monster I was expecting this to be a smash hit.Well was it ? I would say it is in a degree it doesn't live up to the hype or to the success of the first album however it is *different* than your usual Lady Gaga style.While The Fame & The Fame Monster were mostly very *preppy* and full of pop beat songs this album actually has some songs that take a different direction. It also has some saxophone and piano play with less electronic pop and auto tone involved which is not so much of Lady Gaga's style.I'm not going to review this album song by song as other reviewers did so well So I'm going to divide it to the two categories (Songs that I liked and Songs that I didn't like) based on my opinion.SONGS THAT I LIKED :-Marry The Night (It's the #1 song in the album and it's quite decent actually. A Catchy song O.K Lyrics I guess and an alright use of electronic beats. This Song like what other reviews has stated should have been a single)-You & I (It does in fact remind of Speechless and Brown Eyes. If you're not familiar with Lady Gaga's other songs that don't get any radio play then you'll notice it is quite different than for example Poker Face Telephone and all the other popular Lady Gaga's songs. It only has instruments and singing with hardly any autotoning and I think Gaga should make more songs like that)-The Edge of Glory (Well if you listen to the radio or if you already purchased this album chances are you're quite familiar with this song. I think it's better than most songs on the album and it also has a saxophone part. It's quite decent)SONGS THAT I DISLIKED :-Born This Way ( It does sound like Express Yourself. I just couldn't feel related to this song in anyway and I just don't feel it is catchy. Sorry)-Judas (This is pretty much you're average Lady Gaga song that you'll find on the radio. It's catchy for a while but it gets pretty boring after a short period of time and it sounds like Bad Romance but I like it less)-Government Hooker (Hmm I don't understand this song or the concept behind it Oh well. I still think the Hoooooooooooker Part is pretty annoying though and it's tiring for the ear after a while)So Yeah that's my review. If you're a Lady Gaga fan then you'll no doubt buy this album or already has. But if you're a casual fan like me then it really depends on your musical taste whether you would enjoy this album or not. A Lot of The Fame and The Fame Monster fans liked this album less and some didn't like it at all. Another problem I had with this album is that most songs are more like album fillers to me than actual tracks.Give it a try preview the tracks before listening to it and see which once you like best. If you liked most of them enough songs to buy the CD than go for it. If you only liked certain songs then it would be a lot cheaper to just buy those songs as singles from Amazon or iTunes :)
"I was expecting something really amazing. All the hype about this album didn't help. I am disappointed with the lyrics most of all. They're boring and generic. Every song on this album seems to have been made for shock value. ""You and I"" and ""Bloody Mary"" are the only songs that I think stand out as creative and well made. I don't want to listen to this album over and over again like I did with Lady Gaga's The Fame Monster."
"This album in my opinion is Lady Gaga's best and most consistently-listenable album to date. I've heard someone say that this album may be her ""Thriller"" and that person may be on to something.  If Michael Jackson's ""Off the Wall"" preceded that classic album then Lady Gaga's ""The Fame"" may very well precede a classic in its own right as well - ""Born This Way"".What I love most about this collection of songs is that apparently they all encompass everything that Ms. Germanotta loves about music over the last 20 - 30 years and I doubt that she even cares what people think about how everything ended up. The album covers a wide array of sounds and includes elements of rock electro and the usual Gaga-fied dance-pop.  ""Born this Way"" ""Judas"" ""Government Hooker"" and ""Shei&szlig;e"" are the dance tracks not to mention a very campy and theatrical number thrown in -- ""Americano"".  What interested me the most are the throwback tunes.  For example the opening track ""Marry the Night""; it sounds like something Donna Summer would've recorded in 1980 because it has the classic melody and hook that was so personified in late 70's or early 80's disco.  ""The Edge of Glory"" ""Hair"" and ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)"" are the kind of rock anthems that are a breath of fresh air in the year 2011 with the former two songs destined to be hit singles.  Anyway if you are a connoisseur of good pop music with a promiscuous ear then I would strongly recommend this album."
"There was a group that I immensely enjoyed back in the early 2000s.  The group was Nickel Creek. Phenomenal writing musicianship and virtually every song they wrote was a good one.  Their albums sounded genuine.  They unfortunately broke up a few years ago.  I think some artists can only burn so brightly for so long before they either burn out or decide to move on to other things.Lady Gaga is a artist in her own right. Her past 2 records sounded a bit more diverse than ""Born This Way"". She has a good voice writes a lot of her own stuff and seems like she's found her passion and message.But this album just sounds too manufactured formulaic.  It was like her and her producers and all the Corporate sponsors  who capitlized on the previous notoriety and high sales of ""Fame Monster"" are expecting an even bigger return with ""Born this Way"".  Look for Virgin Mobile tour bus headphones (or whatever Gaga Inc. feels like selling out to) in your city or town soon.That doesn't mean I can't enjoy the record. Born this way is a catchy song. ""Hair"" while initially made no sense to me the first listen was whimsical positive message of being wild and free. I liked the rock ballad ""You and I"".So take the album for what it is and enjoy for what it is: Cotton candy for the ears. I'll be listening to this at the gym on my headphones running or when I need  a shot of high energy dance music. In that sense this music serves the purpose.  It's not a slowly cooked album that has had a chance to simmer the way Paul Simon Nickel Creek or other great singer/songwriter artists have. With 14 tracks I also felt it could have been just 1 album which is why I gave it only 3 stars.Maybe next album Gaga will pull back. There are times when ""less is more"" and the producers/writers should keep this in mind on the next CD rather than trying to outdo the previous album. Still there's lots to like about BTW. Gaga's vocals are strong as ever.  All the little Monsters will be happy with her efforts and call this her greatest work to date  but the breadth of it is just a bit much."
I am OBSESSED with Gaga's Born This Way album. I've owned it since it was released and I can't stop listening to it. I even bought two copies (haha). It's almost a pop rock album with some really dark sounds on some songs. You definitely have to listen to it for yourself!
Saw this album on sale and thought I'd buy it. The songs on here are great and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes any Lady Gaga songs.
"Took over an hour to download @99 cents for the album but got it all by hitting ""retry"" a lot.Some toe-tapping tunes here....don't know that I'd pay full price for it but it was worth a buck."
I love gaga! The remixes are great and I love having the monster ball on DVD!!! The packaging is really cool as well! Really like the cover!
Well this is not the album of the decade but is one of the best so far. Rare with beautiful lyrics from the true heart of Gaga. The best songs to me are: Judas and You and I.
From Marry The Night to The Edge of Glory this album is non stop hit after hit! GaGa has out done herself once again! every single track is worthy of a good GaGa video and single release!The booklet itself is a piece of collectible art!This entire album is a getaway drug for the loyal Little Monster! Album of The Year! This album has GRAMMY written all over it! truly The Greatest Thing by far GaGa is NOT done!
Ive been a fan for at least a year before Gaga broke and have import versions of her CDs and remixes.  There was so much hype about this CD and I was worried about the sophomore slump affecting it  meaning how hard it is for artists to follow up a major success with something equally successful.  I am a fan of 80s music so I was excited to see the original album cover which showed Gaga in a jean jacket with a unicorn on it.  I really love Born This Way the references are spot on and the production is amazing.  Only a few songs seemed to slow things down a bit...such as 'Bad Kids.'  I would definately recommend the deluxe edition.
I absolutely loved this. It was perfect just like everything else Gaga does. I think it's one of her bests.
After going to see one of her Monster Ball concerts I thought about the odds of her coming up with even more great music.  I'm pleased to say that her Born this Way album definitely delivers!  It makes me feel like dancing and singing along to the songs.  She may not be liked by everyone but that's OK since her music is just... hers.  She has this unique sound it's sort of difficult to describe.Aside from her music sounding great another of the things I really like about her as a person is the message that she delivers.  She may be eccentric and viewed as odd by some but her message of love of all people (like in Born this Way) is something that not every artist out there encourages.  I'd like to say she empowers people through her music especially once they start listening to what she really has to say.All in all this album is great.  I recommend it for anyone.
It has been 10 days since I made my purchase.  AMAZON has still not allowed me to download the music.  There have now been 2 unsuccessful attempts to resolve the issue with out success.  I have wasted far too much of my time for a 99 cent album.  Had I just gone to iTunes I would have it now not be wasting my time writing this review or wasted 30-45 minutes of my life trying to solve AMAZON TECHNICAL ISSUES.
"I wasn't a Lady GaGa fan at first. But when I heard Bad Romance I was hooked. In my opinion this release is even better than her first cd. I can't get enough of Bloody Mary.To all those that keep posting ""1 star"" reviews because of a donwload issue - I purchased and downloaded all songs to completion without any issue at all. Try to separate computer/download issues from what is intended for review here: the song & music content. Additionally even if you only got 5 of 14 songs isn't that still a great deal for only $0.99? A single download on iTunes is $1.29."
I purchased this when it was a buck.  Yeah it took a bit to download but it really wasn't as bad as some would make you believe.  Heck I would have paid the full price for it anyways so I really got a steel.BUT!...I'm not impressed by the music.  Some of the songs were okay but nothing that blew me out of the water like earlier Lady GaGa songs.  Even Born This Way is kind of dull and it is easily the best song on the album.  I've listened to the album about three times through and I'm sure I'll listen to the songs again in the future but I thought I'd have this listened to about thirty times by now and only be sick of the songs because I overplayed them.I hope her next album is better.  I fear this one won't do much for her career which is a shame because I think she is one of the artists to come around in a long time.  I just think she is better than this album.  Hopefully she isn't getting washed up already.
"I already sampled all the songs and think it's brilliant. GaGa is so out there that I avoided her for a long time. Finally saw her on SNL's season finale and yes... she's wayyy strange but the girl's got talent and the songs are quite catchy. I know I'll love the whole thing when I can listen to every song in their entirety. I see that many are having problems downloading the songs today trying to buy today for the 99! Why? Just ""gift"" the song to your email address and download it later on in the next few days when things quieten down."
I have listened to it. It is alright. For a dollar I can only complain so much. The only thing that irks me is amazon selling the edited versions of things and not letting us all know they are edited. It may be a ploy for more money. It may just be ignorance. The one thing it is not is fair and right to the consumer.
Just bought this for my girlfriend and she feel in love with it. I got it for .99 cent on amazon thank you!
Hi. I just wanted to say that I purchased the full .99 cent album tonight (9pm MST) and it worked beautifully. Don't let the earlier reviews scare you.By the way folks...I understand your disappointment but things happen. Systems crash. I'm sure the demand was OVERWHELMING...even more than expected. The best tested systems fail big time.The CD itself is worth any dilemma. I have no worry that even if my download did not work that amazon.com would've made it right. Why the desire to jump ship after only one error?All I know is that I am jamming to my new Lady Gaga cd that I only paid LESS THAN ONE DOLLAR for and it is all because of Amazon!
I would like to give this CD a proper review but I bought it when it was first released as a special .99 cent download.  Because Amazon was overwhelmed with people downloading the CD at the special price it did not download correctly and I only received 4 songs.  They later sent out an email to everyone who purchased stating how to re-download the album if you didn't receive it all the first time and the second attempt failed as well even though I followed the instructions precisely.  The four songs I received were basic catchy pop songs a la early Madonna.  I think Lady GaGa is talented and would have liked to hear the entire CD but will have to purchase the physical CD to do so.
Why advertise that you get the entire album for 99 cents when Amazon can't deliver. Only six songs showed up in my cloud player the other 9 are..... who knows where?
"Hi I'm Jimmi and I am a Little Monster.  I was blown away when I had heard a promo version of this album.  How many albums have songs that stay with you and that you find yourself listening to over and over again? I find myself going back again and again to ""Marry the Night"" ""Born This Way"" ""Judas"" ""Government Hooker"" ""Schei&szlig;e"" well you get the idea.  The album is filled with songs that are all worthy of single status.  Lady Gaga does go overboard pulling out all stops with operatic vocals songs worthy of meatloaf in his hey-dey Clarence Clemens sax and Brian May's Guitar.  The album is distinctly American with its love of the open road wild nights fueled by whiskey and cigarettes from the open world to Nebraska to the steamy streets of NYC.  The album is grand yet accessible.  It grabs your ears and never lets go.  There are some people who are too cool for school and dis the Lady and her music--time will show them up.  Get your paws on this one!"
I am sorry to say I am not pleased as the CD case arrived with a broken hinge and a scratch on the recorded side.
I am loving the album even though not all of the songs have downloaded. However the review section is usually meant to be used as a forum for your thoughts on the product. Given this its funny that all of these people have taken the time to give the ALBUM few stars when in fact they are upset with Amazon for taking longer than normal to download the album and might actually like the music.Are people just dumb? This is a highly anticipated album and few artists are debuting albums today and even fewer have the presence of Lady Gaga. This along with the fact that Amazon has done something quite amazing in offering this album for only 99 cents would cause many to be concerned over just how popular this might be. Considering that Itunes is selling this for $15 the amazon deal is a HUGE deal! And with the promotion on twitter and facebook i would be surprised if there wasn't a slowdown to the amazon servers.Give it time people have you never been on a site that slows due to high traffic? at least the album is worth the wait especially at the price.Every song on the album is worth it. especially since you are paying the equivalent of one song. I highly recommend buying this asap
One of the most original and beautiful albums I have ever heard. I have never had an album that I can listen to all the way through absolutely loving EVERY single song. Wonderful!
this album is amazing. i can't say i'm suprised because i knew it would be great. she's so unique and creative and that is what these reviews should be about not technical glitches. you're getting her music for a dollar much less than she deserves to get. so my review is 5 stars because of the product itself. it is worth every 99 pennies even if you have to suck it up and wait a while. i want to give props to amazon for having to deal with this and thank you lady gaga for ANOTHER wonderful album. you truly are a huge inspiration to a lot of people. keep it up :)
Classify this disc as the disc of the century one of the best this year. Perfect music dancing. The cover the inserts back everything was beautiful loved
I was looking forward to this album for months and with it being billed (by her) as her best album yet I was expecting something amazing.  I was a bit disappointed.Don't get me wrong the album is good but it is lacking in so many ways.  First of all it felt like it was either extremely rushed or just not well written and produced.  Many of the songs sounded not only similar to past songs by other artists but similar to one another.  There were few songs that stood out on their own which was really disappointing.  After her debut of The Fame and its extended play edition of The Fame Monster I was expecting something really amazing.  Both of those albums had something special in them but Born This Way didn't.Aside from the already released singles the quality of the songs on the album was really and truly lacking.  Sure there were some that were enjoyable i.e. Fashion of His Love but there weren't enough to help this album live up to its hype.  Part of what made this album miss the mark was the recycled sounds of '80s songs.  Another failing of this album was the continued use of religious imagery.  It's okay to use such imagery in one song maybe two but it seemed like every other song on the album was about something religious.  Honestly it got tiring.I know that the album is a success and that isn't surprising.  Gaga fans are extremely loyal but I think that if Gaga really wants to stick around as a major artist she is going to have to up her game.  If she keeps putting out albums that are (in essence) flops artistically I don't see how she'll be taken seriously in years to come.
"Before hearing this album I was sceptical about ""Mother Monster"" being able to deliver material equaling or even bettering the content of ""Fame Monster"". I discovered that ""Born this Way"" made for addictive listening...so much that I cannot think of any album at this time that delivers so flawlessly. In addition to this artist's stunning vocals the musical arrangement is impressive especially on her more up-beat tracks. If she continues in this vein she would be a worthy successor to Madonna should Madonna retire from recording. Only time will tell if she will be able to match Madonna's longaevity or whether she will be able to successfully re-invent herself as Madonna has done so frequently to sustain the interest of her listening market.Even at the age of 46 I couldn't resist becoming a ""Little Monster""!JANSEN (NYC)"
"Haters will hate and fans will love it but if you're just a casual fan you should definitely give this album a listen.Besides the obvious Madonna/80s sound that Born This Way (single) was you can't help but love a song she wrote for her fans. Very rarely will you see artists thank for more than 5 seconds at some award show their fan let alone dedicate a whole song/album to them.Don't let Judas or BTW turn you off from the whole album though each song has a different feel and no track feels like some ""filler.""  You have a wide range of music; from house music-inspired tracks (Heavy Metal Lovers Schei&szlig;e) disco (Bad Kids Americano) some mariachi-inspired songs (Americano) and even 80s power ballads (The Edge Of Glory Yo&uuml; and I); GaGa wrote an album that could be enjoyed by many."
Lady Gaga may have been born the way he/she is; however this music album is just plain bad.  I got it due to the $0.99 price from Amazon but pretty confident it is not worth it.
worked perfectly for me! i just downloaded it then put it on my amazon cloud and from there downloaded them all to my iTunes with my amazon mp3 downloader! very happy :D can't believe it was only 99 cents!
Marry the Night - 10/10Born This Way - 9/10Government Hooker - 8/10Judas - 10/10Americano - 8/10Hair - 8/10Scheibe - 10/10Bloody Mary - 9/10Bad Kids - 6/10Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) - 8/10Heavy Metal Lover - 8/10Electric Chapel - 7/10You and I - 9/10The Edge of Glory - 10/10
Fun songs. Not all of them are to my taste but more than your average album.Can't wait for the next one.
Coming off of The Fame Monster you would expect more from the woman who promised the album of the decade. The album consists of very generic (and repetitive) music and terrible terrible lyrics. The vocals are the only thing that can be admired on the album.
Great deal. Glad that they fixed the problem with downloads. Lady Gaga is so fun. Get it if you love her.
I purchased this album but NOT A SINGLE SONG HAS DOWNLOADED.  If Amazon intended on giving Gaga fans a deal like this they should have fraking been ready to GIVE HER FANS WHAT THEY PURCHASED.  This is one of the most disappointing experiences I have ever had on Amazon.com
Purchased the album for 99 and got what I paid for two songs and the digital booklet. Don't know what happened but Amazon needs to fix this glitch fast and soon.
I like the song. I'm required to type 12 more words for this review so now I'm just killing space.
"The first rule of following up a successful debut is you don't over-stuff the turkey. At 17 tracks I understand Gaga wants to give her fans more bang for the buck and at .99 cents for the whole album sans three tracks found here it might seem that she is being uber-generous to her fans. However if you read the press it appears the .99 cents is just one more marketing ploy to get another jewel in the crown--a million copies sold in the first week and a number one album. How cheap and sleazy. Talk about not trying. I remember the days when you had to make a great album with great songs in order to earn that million copies sold. Now you can just sell it for .99 cents like a cheeseburger at McDonalds. This is definitely the sophomore slump curse barring ""The Fame Monster"" which for some strange reason was categorized as an EP rather than a true album. Again I remember the days when an eight song album clocking in at 34 minutes was considered a legitimate album not some four or six song EP. Even the I know Yes made three song albums that were 40 minutes in length but I digress.As so many others have intuitively pointed out here ""Born This Way"" is over-produced bland repetitive and worst of all forgettable. Is this the same artist who just gave us ""Telephone"" and ""Bad Romance""? Heck is this the same pop star who gave us ""Poker Face"" ""Just Dance"" and ""Paparazzi""? None of that is evident here. There are fragments of songs bits and pieces of good ideas scattered all throughout ""Born This Way"" but it never really coalesces. Even at 14 tracks there are still four tracks too many. This could have been a half way decent ten song album with seven tracks left out for b-sides for those die hard Gaga fans and sparing the rest of her fans like myself who just want something neat and tidy. Get in and get out. Less is more.The lyrics are all over the place. Who is Stefani Germanotta? I can't tell from her first three recordings. Comparisons to Madonna abound but guess what I am old enough to remember specifically what Madonna did that made her the success she is today. She grew musically from album to album. She did not re-tread and recycle. By her fourth and arguably her best album ""Like A Prayer"" she had fully matured into a compelling superstar. Germanotta is floundering here due to her absolute love of her fans. You can't do that. Fans are extremely fickle and you can't cater your music and beliefs to them. Look at Alanis Morissette--mega success then boom! All her fans disappeared and she did change drastically from album to album. But she followed her mega success with the over-stuffed and disjointed ""Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie"" at 17 tracks and nearly 80 minutes in length. That just might have been responsible for killing her career. It certainly scared off the majority of her fans.Germanotta is 25 and based on her lyrics here seems to be pandering to 13 year olds. Why? She could be using her stance on acceptance equality and being herself/yourself to much greater use. But she just wants to have fun (and that killed Cyndi Lauper's career in the end). In order to last you have to demonstrate growth as an artist and on a personal level neither of which Germanotta seems willing to do (yet). Songs about ""Goverment Hooker"" ""Hair"" ""Highway Unicorn"" ""Heavy Metal Lover"" and ""Judas"" just don't add up to much here. Even ""Born This Way"" a celebration of individuality comes off as a stolen riff from Madonna's ""Express Yourself"". She can't offer something more original than that?With no less than eight producers ""Born This Way"" is too much. The production is so inflated and generic it strips the life right out of the album. I suppose if you listened to some songs in isolation they might fool you into thinking that this is a great album but that's not the way to listen to an album. You have to listen from beginning to end and see how you feel when it's over. I start to get antsy around track five or six and my mind starts to wander because there's nothing there to anchor it. Someone else said there's nothing here nothing memorable at all. I wouldn't go that far but this is average compared to what else Germanotta has given us before.Here's how ""Born This Way"" compares to Gaga's other works:2008 The Fame: Three and a Half Stars2009 The Fame Monster: Three Stars2011 Born This Way: Two and a Half Stars"
Lady Gaga has done it again by making a great album. When Lady Gaga first came out I didn't know what to think of her but then my friend let me listen to The Fame Monster and I was hooked. This album really shows her diversity when making albums. She released the song Judas off of this album and she became even more controversial then she already was but that doesn't replace the fact that she is a great artist. She makes deep music that really allows her to express herself. My favorite song off of this album is probably You and I. I really recommend everyone sit down and really listen to each song because I guarantee that you will fall in love with how she is able to express herself so beautifully. Though people say she is a Madonna rip-off I say that is a good thing. Madonna is a music icon and Lady Gaga is following in her footsteps. Just give her a chance and you will be pleasently surprised on how she can affect you emotionally. Deep and emotionally attached is the making of a great album. I definitely recommend this album to everyone.
Say what you will about Lady Gaga but I don't remember any artist in recent memory that created a CD in which each song has a different vibe melody and feeling. Most artists put out a CD of songs that all blend and sound the same but when you listen to Gaga's new album each song has its own voice melody and feel.I love the darker songs and how she incorporates real issues into her tunes. No one else is doing that right now.I'll continue to support her because although she samples heavily from older music (which I kind of love) she twists it and makes it her own. If I were you I'd invest in the Deluxe version. The three added songs are great and the remixes are perfect.
I've been listening to this cd over and over again since Amazon FAILED and I drove to Target and bought it! Great job Amazon I now realize that you and crApple both SUCK!
I don't think this album is the album of the decade or even Gaga's best but it has fun songs and it is so outrageous and bold I'm hoping a listen (or maybe two) to the whole thing on a long flight coming up will keep me entertained.I am mostly writing this review to respond to the crazies who are so angry at Amazon for taking longer than they want to more or less buy them what is probably the hottest digital product of the year.I am perfectly happy to wait longer for the download given the fact that it was cheaper than any ONE of the songs on iTunes--and free 20 gigabytes of cloud storage with an album download is a cool bonus--if it is as easy to back up my music on the cloud as the Amazon MP3 downloader makes downloading music from their store (when the whole world isn't downloading Born This Way that is) I think it will be useful.All in all another bold and useful deal from Amazon that saves me time and money. They are quickly becoming one of my favorite companies :)
Lady Gaga's recent album is great and another step in how her music is evolving. The only reason why it has a 3.5 star rating is because when she released the album on Amazon for 99cents it overloaded the servers. So most of the low star reviews are due to the Amazon digital download service...so don't be deterred to buy this album.Additionally it was 99cents until a day ago when it went up to 6.99. The reason for the 99 cents deal was just a release day promo...so it is not a bait and switch. You just had to be one of the lucky thousands of people who knew about the 99 cent deal to get this album for 99 cents.
Did the artist put out a bad album or not.  If you download isn't finishing send a ticket to amazon don't post a 1 star review of the album (until they fix your download and you actually listen to it).Amazon should remove all reviews that are based on download problems and don't even mention the content of the album (mine included).
Definitely worth the $0.99 to get the 20GB storage. Only 5 songs have downloaded so far but honestly I expected that. Everyone has to realize that Amazon has a lot of subscribers and I'm sure no one is going to try and pass this up purposefully. The bandwidth hit right now must be huge. But great buy. Appreciate it Amazon. If only you had the player for iPhone but that's a conflict of interest now isn't it :P
Disappointing at first but it gets better. I'm not making excuses for it if you have better stuff to listen to then great. If you don't put this back on and let it simmer.
"Love Love Love Love Lady GaGa! Not every track is prime but I'm already hooked on a number of them.Favorites:Born this Way -  If this doesn't make you feel good enroll in zombie school.ScheiBe - Amazing!!! My personal fav of the albumAmericano - Awesome..You'll love this one!Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) - Another winner in my book.Judas - intense wonderful!On the Edge - Clean ""pop"" GaGa but pleasant nonetheless.These two are beginning to grow on me:Heavy Metal LoverBloody MaryThe rest I can live without.Load up your music device of choice and head to the gym with this combo!"
Awesome CD. Favorites: Judas Born This Way Hair and Edge of Glory.Thanks Amazon for the .99 deal for students. Amazon made it possible to enjoy great music for almost nothing!
So....  I do understand the frustration with the downloads today.  But aside from that the album is amazing.  In no way are the songs that have been released as singles so far the best ones.  This album showcases Gaga's creativity diversity and epic talent.  I have nothing but respect for an artist that can write sing dance and play instruments while existing in the pop genre.  Aside from this she has a positive message and is a voice of inspiration for youth and adults alike.  She is like the unicorn nearly mythical.  The songs go from 80's inspired hits to club anthems to epic ballads.  She does take inspiration from a number of artists... and while some may look at it as unoriginal... I see it as paying tribute to the artists that inspired and formed her.  You go Gaga.. keep on making magic.
Yes it took over two hours and 3 tries to get all of the songs downloaded but overall worth the frustation for the great price!
I love her music. Beyond all the drama and costume is a beautiful voice that can be appreciated by all.
Anything lady gaga music wise I get I will say this  is not like her last album I loved the fame monster so much more don't get me wrong I love songs on here too but it's a completely different feel and way of like and appreciation then I have for fame monster.
I have been somewhat of a fan of Gaga for a while as I have seen her perform here and there on various television shows. Her persona is a piece of performance art owing to Bowie and Madonna and all sorts of other influences. This persona has been polarizing as far as I've seen -- she arouses strong emotions. Ultimately though the persona is only part of the image. She is selling herself as a musician and that is how she should be judgedI downloaded this because of my somewhat fandom. Her category is not the kind of music I would normally buy; I listen to punk or I'm not listening to music. I liked her earlier work but even though I don't listen to top-40 radio her Poker Face stuff was overplayed.She is a musician though (she plays the piano); at the very least she has a talented team of writers and producers that help her make good music. I downloaded this album and played it. I was bouncing my head and I wanted to replay it but my wife is too busy working right now so I have to be quite. The songs are upbeat and catchy but more importantly they have variety. Some are close and personal as if she were singing to you and only you but a couple of songs are truly anthem that need to be played at a loud volume with the windows on an open road as you travel to wherever you please. Only I can't since I'm not in the demographic. I'll let Gaga be a guilty pleasure.
"Haven't listened to the album yet... I honestly don't care much about Lady Gaga's music.I bought the album to show support for reasonable digital file pricing.  Thanks Gaga thanks Amazon for making a statement on downloads music prices and the New Music Industry.  I wholeheartedly support this statement.I noticed that downloads were going slowly... and I did have to hit the ""restart downloads"" button to get all my files.So what?  How easy how affordable this is.  Even with the download issues I couldn't have driven to a store and back to buy the album before it got here... and I could start playing some songs within a couple minutes.Seriously one-star reviews because they priced something so reasonably and made it so convenient that demand is out-stripping technology?Congratulations and thanks again to Lady Gaga and Amazon Music... from a devoted iTunes guy who doesn't listen to Lady Gaga."
First I have to say Amazon is awesome and many thanks for this nice price for this album. I look forward to more specials like this. Amazon has always given me top-notched service. I don't feel it's fair to come down on Amazon for the problems with the first release of this album. It's a learning process and they were probably more surprised than anyone with the overwhelming response to this deal. Kudos to Amazon for following through and I did get my full album into my cloud account by the next day.Second is Gaga's album. Good album and well worth the 99cents. I consider myself a somewhat Gaga fan and I still got this album how could I pass it up? If you like more than one song you've gotten your money's worth. I like several. And the timing was great; she was just on SNL and I think it was one of their best shows this season. So in short (too late) if you like just one of Gaga's previous songs you like this album for the 99 cent price.
I don't care for it. But everyone's taste in music is different. I'd hope you would base your music purchases on something other then reviews.
The Fame & the Fame Monster were both 5 stars. Some of the best pop music in recent times. Every time you listen to those albums you will here something new. Born This Way is so poorly produced I can't even listen to an entire song. It sounds like really loud white noise. You will find brain is tired after only a few songs. It isn't even possible to evaluate the creativity of the album because the production is that bad. It makes for good bar music I suppose.
"This album is a bit of a surprise from the very talented Lady Gaga. It is incredibly boring and repetitive much like the last pathetic efforts of the Black Eyed Peas before their recent break-up. Gaga's last two albums were heaping servings of meaty steak and potatoes with memorable funky and infectious rock genius. ""Born This Way"" by comparison is like air-puff cereal light flaky no substance and boring. It sounds like the stuff teenagers dance to at a high school social when they're not really paying attention but just bouncing to a background beat. Maybe that's what this was designed to be...just white noise. It actually lulled me to sleep in the car at a stoplight while I was listening to it!Let's hope she's back in form next time."
Lady GaGa rocks. This is one of the best albums I've listened to in a few years. The albums been out for a while and is still great to hear.
Simply boring. Nothing like her first album.  Album is weird has only 2 good songs. Her Art Pop album is terrible too.
"**Mea culpa! I was a complainer yesterday but I should have viewed some of the other comments first. I did what a ""helpful person"" suggested....went to my account>digital orders> and the Gaga album has ""Currently being processed"" by it. Got it within 24 hrs! Certainly can't complain about anything now....this is quite a gift!Gaga truly does have a gorgeous voice and judging the samples I will indeed keep most of the songs. She is certainly a talent. As far out as she seems on stage I have seen quite a few interviews and she is just an average person sweet darling and working to perfect her art. She says she still feels inferior due to childhood taunting but she should get over that. Buck up Gaga you're a winner! Think how those stupid rude crude bullies will feel at your next big Reunion when you walk in and pay off all their mortgages with pocket change!"
Americano alone is worth the $.99 if you are hesitant. My new favorite song destined to be motivating for any project you have going on. Plus Judas...come on. I'd pay full price for just a few of the gems on this.
I loved Lady GaGa's first album.  It's was fresh!  This one it sort of so so but all the hype really did not help.  Still an interesting listen but I don't LOVE it as much.Even at 99 cents I felt I paid too much for this.
It took me a little to warm up to this album (it's pretty long it was hard to listen to it all in one sitting) but after constantly having it in my car I'm in love.  The songs are just so much fun! Great beats and fun themes.  She's just an all around awesome artist :)
Am loving the album so far! Lots of high energy songs in a variety of musical styles and all of them typical danceable Gaga. I love the mariachi style of Americano the rock edge of Electric Chapel the country twang of You and I. They're all excellent. Highly recommended.
I bought this the first day it came out and Amazon had it for a remarkable deal of 99 cents! Of course I bought it for that price but honestly I would have paid more. This CD is solid! Lady Gaga is a fabulous pop artist.
"I know nothing about Lady Gaga other than a few pictures that I've seen that make me roll my eyes at a new KISS wanna-be or something.  But I do like Amazon Gold Box Daily Deals so I thought I'd download the album.  I mean only 99 cents and at that I already have an MP3 credit so it's free.  How much better could it be to get a taste of this hit-pop-star?So I listen to the music and I'm quite surprised that I don't hate it!  She may look like heavy metal and I may not like the pictures but her music has a great beat.  I didn't listen too much to the words but I did notice the review that complained that some songs were edited for the release-date version of the MP3 album.  This is great for me!  Being ""younger-at-heart"" (i.e. don't like vulgarity) I greatly appreciate this Gold Box deal today."
"Three Grammy nominations for ""Born this way"". The CD is basically about self-acceptance and love who you are. She basically preach's in this album and lets her fans know that they were Born this way."
got this for my girlfriend who is a Lady GaGa fan and to be honest she's starting to rub off on me
There are a few songs on this album that I enjoy but for the most part it's fairly mundane and uninspired. I loved her first album and was so looking forward to this one but I'm disappointed in it. I've given it several listens in the hopes it would grow on me but I'm afraid it's destined for the shelf to remain there along with my other so-so albums as a dust collector.
"Remember when this album first came out it was the only music that sounded like this. The lead single ""Bad Romance"" was so new and different. In a good way that's why everyone loved it! She changed pop!"
i bought this album about 4 times Born this Way is my bible and i love it so much i listen to it everyday .my top 5 ;-Goverment Hooker-Judas-Schiebe-Bloody Mary-Heavy Metal LoverBuy the New SingleMarry the Night 
I have to admit this took a long time to download.  But it is worth it.  99 cents for this amazing album is a deal worth being patient for.  This has been a good lesson in patience for anyone who had to wait more than two seconds.  I waited for nine hours and I am glad I did.  Thank you Amazon for this wonderful deal.  And thank you Lady Gaga for once again sharing your talent with us.  So quit your whining be patient and be thankful.
I ordered this Monday afternoon and was able to download and play all songs within 10-15 minutes.  Believe me - it's worth the wait!  Hopefully next time Amazon will be better prepared for the rush on such a great deal.
Born This Way (Special Edition)I pre ordered this as soon as I was able to not just because Im a huge fan of Gaga but because I knew she was going to top all expectations. She very much did. This cd hasnt left my car cd player since the day I received it. It makes me wonder what will come next.
Say what you will about her style or lifestyle she is fantastic!  The melodies are catchy and even though I like her live arrangements better this does just fine to get me moving.
I love every song on this album. Gaga blows my mind and I get lost in her lyrics and beat. Ergo I love Gaga!
"&iexcl;qu&eacute; bueno es escuchar y ver a Lady Gaga!  este album es uno completo  de gran calidad.  cada canci&oacute;n parece contar una ""peque&ntilde;a historia"" o un drama de superaci&oacute;n  para inspirar  incitar  enternecer o seducir. todas son ""movibles""  para bailar o improvisar una coreograf&iacute;a;  y entremezcladas de una particular sensualidad  amor  optimismo.  lo mejor de lo mejor del pop music para escuchar y ""brincotear""."
This album is way different from The Fame and The Fame Monster. Gaga has definitely added a bit of rock to this album. I love it!
I know many of us had some technical difficulties in being able to download the album.  However as someone who finally had success I can now review the actual album.This is a great album with a lot of different types of sound.  There's something for everyone on this album.
THIS ALBUM IS A BOOK OF REVELATION TORS NONE BELIEVERS AND PEOPLE THAT LOCK THEM SELF IN OBSCURE PLACES GOOOOOOO GAGA I Love IT!
There are only 3 good songs on the CD Marry the Night ScheiBe Government Hooker the rest goes from Mediocre to just plain boring. Apparently Gaga is not good at paying attention to detail because The production is so bad and WAY overproduced that the sound on some songs are clipped (just like when you record something and the volume is too loud). The music itself is generic disposable dance music nothing innovative as I would have expected from a so called innovator the songs are generally just a rehash of Madonna (she does it so much better) house music circa late 80's early 90's and Rock/Pop from the 80'sDon't bother and waste your money!!!!Not even worth 0.99 cents.I now have no doubt that Gaga has failed to deliver the goods musically and is all hype with no real substance she will soon start to fizzle out.
Can't believe that such a great album is at such a low price! Hopefully Amazon will do this with future releases. Thanks to Amazon and Lady Gaga for making this happen!
If you heard beeps and skips in certain songs (namely Government Hooker) its because this is the clean version of the album.This is the second album of LG that Amazon has put out without specifying that its a clean version.Go on itunes and pay the extra dollar or two.
I have been waiting for this album for awhile now all the songs are fanatical. I think that this album truly shows off Lady GaGa's vocal ability it has much more meaning and each song seems to have a powerful message being portrayed in the listeners mind. I think this album is 5/5 stars personally. I bought the deluxe edition off iTunes though and I heard the controversies Amazon is experiencing through its super promotional deal for having this album sell at only 99cts. If you are one of the many individuals waiting please be patient. Quit complaining you were guaranteed the full album download. Its better to wait for the album knowing it was purchased for that awesome price. Least you didn't pay $13 dollars for it off iTunes or at a retail store.
It's a good album and for a dollar you can't beat it! (assuming you are getting this on 5/23/2011 when amazon had it for $0.99).The mp3 process looks to be fixed and I have access to the full album in my cloud drive instantly except for 1 track which I had to refresh my cloud drive before it showed it downloaded it.Great deal amazon thanks!
"I have been a ""Little Monster"" before she even had any albums out so naturally I support anything she does and I have tremendous amounts of respect for Mother Monster Gaga!----I am going to say that she is a good person at heart and down to earth and that is great because its rare for someone to be this popular and still be the same person before they hit fame! You can attack her as much as you want but it still does not change the fact that she has huge amounts of pure talent! She can sing live (which most mainstream artists can not do) play the piano well write her own lyrics design and think of concepts for fashion and the way she performs in general! This is extremely rare for mainstream artists. As you can tell I HATE mainstream BS Gaga is the exception (although I loved her before she was mainstream).Lady gaga may not be 100% original but who is these days? It has all been done before. And to those who think she is copying Madonna I got something to say to that which is she is inspired by her along with many others such as David Bowie (how cool is that remember the thunderbolt on her face in ""just dance""...yeah)so what is wrong with having an inspiration? Also just a thought Madonna was never 100% original either so stfu! Lady Gaga does it so much better anyways because she can actually sing unlike Madonna! /rant----That said of course Gaga has evolved! Do not expect her to be the same forever! With Born this way she has a better concept and over all theme for this album then ""The Fame"". I think this album as a whole is amazing because I can hear the fusion of Metal Electro80's and Pop which is very cool in my opinion! Electric Chapel is a perfect example!At first I hated the fact that I thought Lady Gaga was trying to push ""Christianity"" on the public (A Wiccan myself) but eventually I can to the realization that whats the big deal? It is her music and she writes about what makes her happy! And its not like she is saying ""Believe in Jesus or else you are going to hell"" type deal. I have warmed up to the concept.I guess its time to break it down by song.Marry The Night 4/5 : Very 80's meets Electro and of course the lyrics are great :DBorn This Way 4/5 : At first I did not care much for this song but I guess I warmed up to it and the message behind itGovernment Hooker 5/5: One of my favs very unique and DARK which I love! NIN meets GagaJudas 5/5 : LOVE IT! I especially love the part when she says ""EW"" and what comes after! Also the remixes are amazing!Americano 3/5 : Maybe I will love it later the concept is cool but I hate Mariachi music sorry.Hair 5/5 : I love the message behind this and I can relate to this a lot actually.Scheisse 5/5 : I love German music especially German Industrial and this reminds me of that but in a more Pop type music.Bloody Mary 5/5 : The lyrics are amazing and it reminds me of Synth-Pop which I like.Black Jesus + Amen Fashion 3/5 : Possibly the weakest song on the albumBad Kids 3/5 : Tie with Black Jesus for weakest song in my opinion.Fashion of His Love 3/5 : The remix is much better! But still very 80'sHighway Unicorn 4/5 : Liking the name its groovy (yes)Heavy Metal Lover 5/5 : The beats are AMAZING! Along with the unique vocals how could you dislike?Electric Chapel 5/5: Reminds me of a metal band playing in a church while Gaga is singing her heart out! One of the best!The Queen 5/5 : I guess this could be Edge of Glory 2.0You and I 4/5 : This is so good but I had this song WAY before this album and I played it out to much. Also kinda Country EW!The Edge of Glory : 5/5 At first is did HATE this song but now it is amazing! It has an 80's feel to it.All the remixes are amazing but I can not stand Born this way (The Country Road Version) sorry I hate country and hopefully Gaga does not venture anymore in Country music! Country in itself is a mindless pathetic genre. Don't believe me? Walk down the isle's of any retail store in the Country section and you will see that every single album cover is the same............okay I am way off topic anyways BUY this album you will not be disappointed even if you are not a fan of her music. Also if you are a fan of Electronic music you HAVE to check this out because the beats are amazing! And most of all have an OPEN MIND and enjoy little monsters!Paws Up!"
I'm Glad I could find this cd It Rocks.It came really quick during the holiday season.It was a good find I am happy with it.
"Without a doubt no one can say Lady Gaga is not innovative; her creativity bleeds from everything she does--head nod to those who say she is not entirely creative yet she does give credit to those who have inspired her.This new album is definitely not as pop as it is pop-rock.Before BTW was released there was massive tension about the out-of-the-blue and close release date of Femme Fatale. Little Monsters and Britney fans were all turning the cd releases into a competition. Needless to say both cds take a completely different approach to pop music and comparisons between Lady Gaga and Britney should stop now. The only thing their music has in common is the fact that any one of their singles will remain on the charts for some time after being released.Placing BTW next to The Fame and The Fame Monster EP it is hard to say whether I prefer BTW because it is newer or simply because it is truer. Breaking into the business Gaga padded her original pop-rock sound--seen in her Red & Blue cd when she still went by Stefani Germanotta--by giving it a more pop sound which did extremely well on the radio due to its purpose to appeal to the masses. Shifting from this and into the Fame Monster Gaga showed more of her truer colors.Finally we have BTW.Lady Gaga has grown a lot since her two releases and continues to write more interesting lyrics and melodies. Still true to pop yet given more edge Gaga's songs still have dance-ability yet they are not as easy going down.Many people will be put off by church-related images and the ""blasphemous"" ""Judas."" However the difference between the reality of the images and the fantasy must be observed... They're metaphors people. Gaga even states in ""You and I"" that she will always serve Jesus Christ verbatim.Ultimately this new sound really works for me. Darker songs like ""Bloody Mary"" and passionate songs like ""Americano"" and ""Highway Unicorn"" really resonate with me and seem to be the themes of Gaga's mission statement for the past year or so. Finally all of her promoting LGBT rights and personal freedoms takes form in her music! Clearly Gaga walks the talk proudly. I am happy with the extended version but to be honest you do not need the three extra songs as Gaga's music is best represented in the original version.Can't wait to see where she takes us next! Hoping her next single is one of my three favorites!"
I was excited today to find that my preordered CD had arrived a day earlier than expected (which is to say only three days after it was out in stores rather than four). I was less thrilled when I found out that what I had purchased was censored. I really wish Amazon had specified this so that I could have gone elsewhere.
I too thought this cd would be a flop something not worth buying and pretty much discography filler. Given the huge 0.99 cent release for the digital album I was pleasantly surprised! Many songs contain the hearty original sound of Gaga but it is simply evolved. I was worried after hearing the two primary singles -- Born this Way and Judas (Born this way is cute or whatever but its definitely not a song you can listen to over and over again. Judas is the same way but I found the chorus to be annoying. Thankfully Judas has definitely grown on me since then.)Hair Americano ScheiBe Bloody Mary Marry the Night Edge of Glory Bad Kids and Heavy Metal Lover are an ode to the old Gaga and are lyrical gold. Marry the Night has a tasteful sound that exudes an 80s female power ballad something akin to Houston's I wanna dance with somebody but far more tasteful in a contemporary setting. My favorite songs off of this CD would definitely be Bloody Mary ScheiBe and Heavy Metal Lover -- all exude old gaga and are incredibly amazing. Bloody Mary especially despite its religious undertones has the sickest beat includes some Gregorian Chant (chanting her name Gaga) -- which is completely epic! Not to mention the extremely catchy chorus and syllable schlepped at the end. I've found myself singing this song only after I had heard it twice. ScheiBe is amazing as well and as a lover of foreign music I've sang the german part over and over.Definitely worth the 7 bucks; don't listen to the naysayers as I was a naysayer before this CD came out -- and I've found too many things to like than to not like the whole CD at all. And I consider myself liberal when it comes to music love all beats and flavors. A good beat accompanied by meaningful lyrics executed beautifully in song is something that cannot be denied in retrospect to Gaga.Besides at least she didn't sing the same line over and over again like Who Runs the World!?!?! (Girls!!!) for the first 2 1/2 minutes of a song.
Just spoke to the people at Amazon.com and immediately after I hung up I got all my songs on my cloud!tHE albun is great!!
HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT....IT ROCKS VERY ENTERTAINING..  LADY GAGA IS THE BOMB.....ELECTRIC CHAPEL AND HEAVY METAL LOVER AND BORN THIS WAY IS MY FAVES FOR NOW ----EDITED EDITED EDITED
By far the best album released this year. Every single song an adventure to different sounds fitting perfectly with the creative lyrics. If you are looking for high quality pop music you will be more than surprised with Born This Way.
Very funky poppy and fun to listen to.Pick up this album and listen to the many great hits from Lady Gaga!
I have purchased music from Amazon in the past and have had no problems. With this being the lauch of the album and the promotion that has been done for it... I wish Amazon would have been better prepared for the flood of people buying the new Lady Gaga at this incredible price. I am sure the latency in all of us downloading the music will be cleared up but I did expect a much better experience.
My daughter loved her cd that was purchased for her for Christmas.  Lady Gaga has done it again! Daughter says it is a great cd.
The songs on this cd really have grown on me since I purchased it about 1 month ago. At first I just listed to the Edge of Glory (fantastic song) over and over. I had heard Born this Way and Judas on the radio and neither of those are my favorites although they are both good they just don't stick in my brain like You and I and Bloody Mary do. My other favorites are Bad Kids and Gov't Hooker.  All in all I like this one just as much as her other CD's. Definitely worth the money.
"The controversies swirling around Lady Gaga as of late are all religion-centric.  It is true that Lady Gaga's new album is filled with religious references (some right on the surface as song titles).  Some criticize Lady Gaga for mocking or trashing religion on some level but this is far from the truth.Although some religious references may appear at first to be offensive they're all either surfacy references (how many people have tried to explain that ""Judas"" is about loving someone who's wronged you or someone you love?) or criticisms against people who've hounded her fans (e.g. ""I don't speak your Jesus Christo"" from ""Americano"").  Lady Gaga's self-proclaimed mission with ""Born This Way"" is to let her fans know that it's okay to be who they are.  Since many of her fans have witnessed protests and oppression at the hands of those who claim to be religious and Christian it seems only natural that she at least vaguely reference these people and their misled beliefs.THAT BEING SAID the music is the real star here and even the religious references aren't nearly as common (and certainly not as inflammatory) as many would have you believe.Heavily influenced by 80s rock and pop ""Born This Way"" may be a throwback to a great era in music while but it still retains newness and originality.The special edition is worth the extra cost.  Of the three additional tracks two (""The Queen"" and ""Fashion Of His Love"") are some of the better tracks on the album.  The remixes are interesting but not vital or necessary to the album.Overall Lady Gaga delivers exactly what she's known for and what we've come to expect: great songwriting great vocals and an ever-evolving since of exactly who ""Gaga"" is as a songwriter and an individual.  It does not disappoint."
"From what I have been hearing this album is either love it or hate it. Personally I love every song except for Bad Kids and The Queen (latter of which is on Deluxe version). I would admit that for .99 cents this is a great bargain; for me though I am glad I got the deluxe version...I am a fan of remixes so it works.One of the biggest things I noticed is that this album is a totally different style than what I - and presumably other - Gaga fans are used to. I think this is far from ""trash"" that people have been calling it. Again I feel that you will either like these songs or they will not be your style. My personal favorites are Marry the Night Government Hooker Bloody Mary and Heavy Metal Lover. Overall the album does not disappoint. If you are looking for similar music to what she has released in the past you may find similar beats/rhythms in parts of the songs; however the songs are less general pop and more heavy rock style.Also a small comment - please STOP saying Gaga is copying Madonna. Seriously...every artist has obvious influences and they use those influences to help with the creative process. Madonna is just one of many influences that can be found in Gaga's music. And no I am not ""brainwashed"" by her music either...I'm quite capable of thinking for myself - I just know good music when I hear it. And hey if you don't like it enjoy your your freedom to choose not to listen to it :)"
so Boring and generic because swim on the same as well no contest on one song adding her abuse using a allegorical  allusive use of God  no way this cd should be out  and if we add the issue how they do promotions to get sell and more $$$$$ anyone could do this and get a lot of sell  She is no doing well
"Last year Lady Gaga promised ""Born This Way"" would be the best album of the decade. That declaration was enough to skyrocket her follow-up to 2009's EP ""The Fame Monster"" to the peak of anticipated albums for 2011. The first single from ""Born This Way"" the title track confirmed this massive anticipation by breaking the iTunes record for the fastest selling single; passing the 1 million mark in 5 days. Now ""Born This Way"" is finally out for everyone left on Earth after the May 21 rapture to enjoy.At 14 tracks in length with over an hour of total music Gaga ensures enough potential singles to dominate the remainder of 2011 and perhaps finally knock Adele off the top of the charts. Four singles have hit the airwaves so far: ""Born This Way"" ""Judas"" ""The Edge of Glory"" and ""Hair"" but more are likely to come once fans hear the album as a whole and start requesting their favorites.Pop stars have an extremely difficult job to do when composing an album. By definition and name pop music is in a word popular. The music gets that way by following current trends of the music industry until an oversaturation of the style forces the innovation of ""the next big thing."" Over the past decade pop music has seen a massive increase in the popularity of the Auto-Tune effect and dubstep a style that has overtaken dance clubs around the world with the help of an incessant beat. Play a track off of Britney Spears' latest record which leans heavily on both dubstep and Auto-Tune to the Britney of the late '90s and she wouldn't recognize herself. That is precisely how quickly the pop genre evolves.Enter Lady Gaga quite possibly the biggest female pop icon since Madonna. Her wild outfits and high octane stage performances made her a household name seemingly overnight but she is still restricted by the shackles of the pop industry. Although Lady Gaga is very much original in fashion sense and persona her music is typically not.Opening with ""Marry the Night"" Lady Gaga seems to offer listeners a history lesson of how she developed her sound.The quiet opening is straight out of the `80s but downbeats are soon replaced with thick synthesized chords and a beat many listeners will find similar to Corona's 1993 hit ""Rhythm of the Night."" Add in modern production techniques and Lady Gaga's first track off the new record is less ambitious than many expected but easily capable of becoming a single before long.""Marry the Night"" is followed by ""Born This Way"" the track everyone has already compared to Madonna's ""Express Yourself"" countless times. The similarities are there yes but that doesn't make it a bad song. Madonna was the queen of pop for a reason and Lady Gaga isn't going to fill her shoes without stepping on her toes once in a while.As ""Born This Way"" takes shape Lady Gaga takes more chances with mixed results. ""Government Hooker"" is a half-hearted attempt at political commentary. With lines like ""put your hands on me John F. Kennedy"" it's hard to take the track very seriously but musically Gaga pushes the envelope. If this track were to ever be played on the radio Gaga's 30-second computerized operatic intro would absolutely be cut; not because it's bad but because it fails to fit the mold of pop music. After the intro ""Government Hooker"" is a much more club friendly track but anyone who buys ""Born This Way"" will hear all of Gaga's risk-taking moments like this one.Now the world's biggest pop star Lady Gaga nods to her overseas influences on the tracks ""Americano"" and ""Schei&szlig;e."" Complete with lyrics in both Spanish and German Gaga adds a new twist to her songwriting which could very well become the expected norm on future records. Her single ""Alejandro"" on the EP ""The Fame Monster"" used the phrase ""en su bolsillo"" to introduce a new language but ""Born This Way"" takes the idea and runs with it.Although the entire album is filled with addictive dance tracks some of the brightest moments on ""Born This Way"" are saved for the finale. ""You and I"" the only track for which Lady Gaga is the sole composer slows the beat down for a song more at home in the Classic Rock era. Completely different from the rest of the album the crunch of an electric guitar reminiscent of Joe Walsh's ""Life's Been Good"" sits behind a piano ballad and 80's rock harmonies on the chorus. Gaga's vocals however are always at the forefront; showing the world she's easily worthy of her diva status.Finally the album closes with a celebratory pop track ""The Edge of Glory."" Already a single ""The Edge of Glory"" isn't Gaga's most original moment but it finds her utilizing all of her strengths to perfection. With a saxophone part adding some style and flair more common in a Bruce Springsteen song than in the realm of pop Gaga bridges the genre gap one final time as she brings her second full-length album to an end.Is ""Born This Way"" the best album of the decade? Absolutely not but it may prove to be one of the best pop albums of the decade. Lady Gaga is as original as a pop artist is allowed to be in this era of music and for that she should be applauded.Track Suggestion: ""The Edge of Glory"""
"Anybody who bought this for $.99 got one heck of a deal. I realize that Amazon had its problems and although I did have trouble downloading everything I got the album and the wait was worth it. Although there are a couple of forgettable tracks the majority of the album is full of great dance beats and those ""What did she just say?"" lyrics. Any Lady Gaga fan will be happy to add this album to their collection but I feel as if her best work is still ahead of her."
This really sucks... Going back to iTunes. At least when I buy music it downloads. All I got was the booklet. Who cares !! What up with this crap Amazon ! Using your customers are beta testers ?
To all of you anal-retentive OCD folks popping your Adderall this may not be the purchase for you.  Evidently if Amazon sells you a 99 cents album and you can't play the whole thing within 2 seconds the world is coming to an end.For the rest of us buy this album for 99 cents.  After Amazon tells you that your purchase is complete then walk away from your computer (slowly with no sharp objects nearby) and go chill out for a few hours.  Take a walk.  Have a real conversation with a friend.  Make yourself a snack.  Then in a few hours come back to your Amazon account page and the entire album will be there.Cheers.
I am not sure if it was a fluke or not but I purchased this great deal online and paid for it and I did not get any of the songs but ended up with a virus instead!  I had to get my IT department involved it was Malware.  I usually really love Amazon but for this purchase I was dissppointed.
I'm not sure about the problems people were having earlier with purchasing this album for an incredible $0.99. All I can say is that I had ZERO ISSUES. I opened Cloud Player and the whole album was right there. I'm listening to it as I type this review. It sounds good so far but I'm mainly writing to counteract the inane and baseless 1-star ratings that have appeared all because folks are having download difficulties. Do you really think THE largest online retailer is going to screw you out of a whopping 99 cents?!? Really?!? I now buy all of my music through Amazon's MP3 store since it's DRM free and almost always cheaper than iTunes. I have never had a single issue with any purchase. As others have already posted exercise some patience and use the proper channels to voice your concerns with Amazon and not the artist!
This is the best deal for this caliber of music ever! Lady Gaga for $1?! WOW. I love the album!
I  love the CD especially the track YOU AND I which makes me want to sing saw it performed on THE VIEW and just had to have it.
While all songs downloaded without problem I'm not able to find where I can get the digital booklet...other than that I was very happy to find this album at this price - wanted to get this since seeing Gaga on SNL...
When Lady Gaga first came on the scene I thought her music was catchy and kind of just nodded along to the beat. But after I researched her and listened to more of her stuff and as she grew an as an artist I grew as a fan. By The Fame Monster I was addicted. Bad Romance is STILL my favorite music video (by any artist) of all time. I went to the Monsterball and it was more than spectacular. I never thought she would top herself. Then Born This Way came out. It's got a great title single that can make ANYONE feel good and it was only an appetizer of the rest of the meal. The beats suck you in and don't let go until the end and the lyrical genius that is Lady Gaga is a once in a lifetime wonder. Gaga knows how to write a song she knows how to sing it and she knows how to outdo the Queen of the unimaginable by sticking to her guns and producing hit after hit after hit. Gaga doesn't have a fan in everyone but those who won't give her a shot are missing out. If you haven't bought Born This Way yet now is your chance. Get it now so you can say that you were a part of history and you owned a copy of one of the greatest albums the world has ever know.
Lady gaga has done it again. her new album is as good or even better than her last. I cant wait to see her on tour in the winter. keep it up gaga for us being little monsters!
"Let me start by saying that I am not a pop music fan. I have over 3000 CDs and 99% are heavy metal but this woman caught my attention with ""Bad Romance"" and I have been a fan ever since. I find her image a bit forced but I can't deny that this album is some of the best pop I have heard. There are no songs I want to skip and I can't get it out of my CD player. Truly a brilliant pop album and I can't wait to see what she does next.Highlights for me are: Marry The Night Hair Scheisse Bloody Mary Highway Unicorn Heavy Metal Lover Electric Chapel Edge of Glory. However you know its a great album when favorites vary depending on who you ask. Well done!"
Couldn't even complete the purchase process. Now the day after I hear that Amazon's servers couldn't handle the load. Good thought Amazon but you need an upgrade before you try it again!
I got this entire album download & digital booklet at a great price on the 1 year anniversary of the release of Born This Way. The entire album is awesome and Lady Gaga rocks! I highly recommend this to anyone that loves music!
CD was very shiny and clean.  Plays well in our CD player.  The music is OK my wife bought it.  I do like the CD though very colorful.
(5/25 revision)There must have been an error with the purchase. All songs are now visible for download. I'm still not satisfied with Amazon's handling of this purchase though.  If there are technical issues it's incumbent on Amazon to let the buyer know.  I'm a reasonable guy I'll understand - if you set the proper expectations.  Unfortunately the product review does not reflect the music review.  I'm not happy with the way Amazon executed this order but I am happy with the Gaga album.****************************(previous review)Just bought the album advertised for 14 songs plus the digital download.  ONLY 7 Songs are showing up in cloud player.  Is this blatant fraud? I wonder how many States Attorney's General will be working overtime to sue Amazon?I love you Gaga but this is Ridiculous!
Great album. I got in early so I didn't have download issues. A few songs took a little bit longer to come in but nothing a refresh couldn't fix.
This is a good Lada Gaga CD. &#34;Born This Way&#34; is a CD that has radio singles great singing and good musicality.
Quite possibly the best work to date!  I cannot wait to see how Ga Ga evolves.Thank you for great music great shows and everything else you do for the world!
I just can't stop listening to this CD.  So many of the songs stick in my head.  If you are looking for Mozart or something don't buy this CD.  If you are looking for a hot dance mess of a good time  This CD is for you.
Lady Gaga is an amazing person with a great heart and a great attitude and this album simply says that. I believe that not only is this album enjoyable for anybody it could also be helpful for people who are gay and cant accept it because there parents say its a bad thing or they get teased or something. This album helps you accept the fact that you are who you are and you should be proud of this.
"A success. That's all you need to really know. Get it and get ready to hear tracks from it for the next year or more. I'm not out to address Gaga's history her personality or influences whatever. I'm here to talk about the music so let's dig into the album. And indeed I use the word 'album' here after some consideration because this an album. This is not as one often encounters nowadays in mainstream pop a smattering of singles spread among a bunch of filler songs that really don't matter. This is an album; every song has its place and purpose and there are actually no songs that I would toss out as superfluous. Contrary to The Fame this album actually feels like a statement from Gaga rather than a couple singles and then padding.What about the songs? Well let's be realistic. It's Lady Gaga so you can expect nothing beyond the basic bass-driven 4/4 perfect-tempo-for-grinding-at-the-club song over and over again; literally almost every song is at the same tempo has the same song structure and is driven by very similar beats (with the obvious exception of You and I). But that's Lady Gaga and if you're expecting something else walk back out the door right now and take your pretensions and snobbery with you.Let's not quibble about religious allusions or whether Gaga ripped off so-and-so (SERIOUSLY WHO CARES) or whether Lady Gaga is this or that or whatever. We've already established that this is an album full of simple pop songs but are they good pop songs? Unambiguously yes. Gaga has an ear for hooks and melodies that very few artists have nowadays. Few people seem to appreciate how incredibly rare and difficult this is; chords and songs are easy compared to melodies. Yet here we have an album full of perfect hooks: the pre-chorus of Bloody Mary (""dance dance dance with my hands hands hands...) the near-wordless chorus of Heavy Metal Lover even the completely nonsensical ""German"" at the beginning of Schei&szlig;e (personal note: I speak German and it is not ANY sort of German I've ever heard. besides the word schei&szlig;e). All of it is perfectly conceived to stick in your head and it will. And this album sees Gaga expanding her musical palette far beyond The Fame. There's nothing drastic (she ain't about to drop a mandolin solo or something) but some delicate and clever instrumentation on each track shows off a much more mature songwriter (as well as some influences from other genres). I also really appreciate her newly found restraint on some songs; The Fame (+TFM) was all about bombastic overblown melodies and choruses but here Gaga is content to chill a little more on choruses to much greater effect. As mentioned the choruses of Bloody Mary and Heavy Metal Lover are perfect examples of this restraint.One more compliment is in order and this one is a little less immediate but touches on (in my mind) the real reason for Gaga's appeal. That reason is this: Gaga writes songs full of beautiful and instantly gratifying chord changes and that really drives her appeal. Clarification: we could have another pop song in the vein of Pachabel's Canon (see the Axis of Awesome '4 Chords' video) or we can have Bloody Mary where those chords in the pre-chorus could serve as the basis of a beautiful folk/indie/whatever song if it was stripped of its heavy beat and other pop-isms. The same thing applied to TF/TFM; if you took her chords and used them in a different setting they would be lovely. They are here as well but sometimes it's harder to realize that due to the poppy nature of the music. I mean just look at the title track - the whole track follows the chords of the 'na-na-na' part of Hey Jude exactly (as in much more exactly than Express Yourself you time-wasting armchair critics). Born This Way sounds anthemic and triumphant for the same reasons Hey Jude did 40 years ago. She writes good chord changes. That's all I'm saying.So the good - strong melodies strong chord changes playing to her strengths with powerful beats and simple song structures and a widening of the musical palette ever so slightly. Let's talk about the bad. First a general problem: Gaga still can't write major-key optimistic pop songs. All her biggest hits are minor-key dark driving pop songs like Bad Romance Telephone and (soon enough) Schei&szlig;e and Government Hooker. So songs like Fashion of His Love You and I Hair Edge of Glory and (somewhat) Highway Unicorn aren't going to stick like Schei&szlig;e and Government Hooker. Well Edge of Glory might in that 'oh my goodness it's the end of the night and we're all drunk and i love my beautiful friends and i'm gonna sing edge of glory way too loud and poorly with my arms wrapped around friends' sense. Sorta like when Nsync or Backstreet Boys or really any 90s anthem comes on. But I digress. Other things I don't like - Government Hooker is a rather obnoxious ""sketchy club"" song with little of the melodic appeal of the rest of the album (but it's going to be a big hit guarenteed). Judas - Judas literally sounds like someone said to Gaga ""hey remember Bad Romance? do that again so we can have a single!"" So Gaga churned out this totally vapid bland single that borders on self-parody. Seriously compare Judas and Bad Romance and their hooks. I wonder if Gaga even likes this song.Alright enough. So what am I trying to say here? Well first off this is an album not a collection of singles with crap in between. Well done to Gaga there. Second her melodies hooks and beats are strong as ever. Third she still can't write optimistic ballads. Whatever. So this is a strong album and not just for pop. It's relentlessly fun passionate catchy and almost perfectly conceived as a vision of Gaga's music. No five stars from me personally - she's not changing the game here and I'd love to see her take her perfect winning formula and see how far she can stretch it. I think she'd do well to push herself a little more outside her comfort zone. But I do give four stars because this is as good as pop music gets. And pop haters armchair critics music snobs - lighten up or get out. I guarentee you aren't snobbier than me when it comes to music but the difference is I know (rather we the Lady Gaga fans know) how to lighten up and enjoy simple fun music for what it is. And that's really what music is about eh? Connecting with people (which Gaga clearly does) and bringing out these simple emotions that reality usually isn't able to provide. So let us dance and scream the words out loud while you guys sit stuffed up complaining about the state of music nowadays or something. Gaga is dope. Peace.Favorite tracks: Schei&szlig;e Heavy Metal Lover Bloody Mary"
I bought this because Amazon is selling it so cheap today.  However after listening to the whole thing I have to say that I can't remember a single song.  There was absolutely nothing in this album that caught my attention.  It is utterly forgettable.  About half the songs on her first album were really good.  The other half were forgettable.  This album is 100% like that forgettable half of the previous album.  Couldn't she at least come up with one catchy tune for this one?  And let me be clear on this I like Lady Gaga.  But this album really doesn't show any of her talent.  Sad.
Album is alright.  Not as good as I expected but I'm not a huge Lady Gaga fan.  It was however definitely worth the $0.99.  I'm actually really only writing this review because I wish Amazon had been better prepared.  I bought it the second time it was $0.99 and it DL'd in a minute.  The Cloud service rocks and I think this promo may really help them.  I'm backing up all my music as we speak and will likely buy the $20 a year for 20g package.  I just hope the mess-up didn't send more customers running than it converted over.  I'll be buying all my music through Amazon instead of iTunes now.  I still don't understand why iTunes forces you to install the application to buy music.
I just purchased the Lady Gaga album & got charged but it didn't download! I will have to stick with i-tunes!!
One of my most favorite albums of all time. I did not care much for the remixes on the 2nd disc but the country version of Born This Way is  great! There is a lot of songs 17 tracks on the first disc all are real songs and not remixes. This is definitely worth a buy such great songs on here and the songs sound different than most other songs currently being made that's what I like about Lady Gaga she doesn't make every song sound exactly like every other song by every other artist she actually creates something she wants to make not just not what will sell best. Many artists only have green in  their eyes while through Gaga's vision she only sees the music notes.
Let  me start off by saying  I LOVE LADY GAGA. Her first album was awesome the 2nd is epicand this one just proves how fresh she is.  In my opinion shes THE NEW MADONNA for my generation. All in all amazing album. IM ADDICTED ALREADY!
Great Album.  Took 24hrs to download completely but I have no issue with that at such a reduced price. .  People who complain about a slow download of 99 cent new release from a high selling artist are the same people who buy cheap airline tickets and are annoyed about no service.  You get what you pay for.If you love Gaga you'll love this.
"People should think before giving a review it is not that difficult.The album is great and it is a daily special for 99 cents which it a steal if you ask me.You get the entire album + 20GB cloud storage for the price of 99 cents.If you haven't got all your songs it is because the order is still ""processing"" due to so many people purchasing and taking advantage of this great deal.Amazon usually takes less than 60 seconds to send the order receipt to your email account if you haven't got it then you now know why..I purchased the album probably 2 hours ago and I only have access to 7 songs out of the 14 and my order is still ""processing"".If you would like to speed up your order give them a call.. simple as that.Now please consider editing your review as it is a delay from amazon's processing system not a problem with the album.. remember this is a digital download order."
I'll admit it took me a while to warm up to but with not a bad song on it this CD is simply amazing.
This album is awesome.  Another great job to our Mother Monster.  From another cool Nebraska guy.-Thalisman
Favorite songs:Bloody MaryJudasHairScheibeEdge of GloryGovernment HookerThe album altogether is awesome her best to date.I HAD problems with downloading all 14 songs from the Sound player but I was able to get all 14 songs on my iPod. Just gotta play with the player.5 STARS!
"I loved it before I listened to it!I like its rock sound. Tracks like Heavy Metal Lover Eletric Chapel Bad Kids or Yo&uuml; and I.My favourite ""hit"" of the album is Scheisse. It's so catchy! I'm obsessed since I first heard it. It needs to be a single.I think the worst song is ""Americano"" though I like it it's so strange. I've got mixed feelings with this song. I'm Spanish and I love the fact that she sings in my language.Clarence Clemons made two great appearences on Hair and Th Edge Of Glory. So sad he has passed away :( may him RIP.I love the whole album! I own the standand and special editions.Love Gaga can't wait to see her live on her new tour!"
"I Just look for good music and I've liked stuff I've heard from Lady Gaga on the radio. I love the song ""Born This Way"" and other songs on this album. However when I hear this entire album all at one sitting I am disappointed by the similarity of the music on each track. I wish people would warn me when an artist doesn't really have a band behind her but just a drum machine and electronic mimicry. Lady Gaga is a very talented singer and does wonderful things with her singing style on this album. I also love her lyrics. The repetitiveness of the music made me wish I just bought the single and left it at that. However there are several songs different enough to make this a good experience for me but overall I don't think it's great. If she goes beyond this disco throb sound on the next album I will try my luck again and I have a feeling she will produce many masterpieces of varied music in the future."
I have this for one reason only. Amazon was selling it for 99 cents and I had some store credit so I paid zero for it.  Zero is the amount of stars I'd give it if Amazon allowed that.Anyway I was curious to see if she really was as bad as I thought she was and therefore mouthing off about her. I was right. It's crap.But still the 99 cent/free purchase gave me a free 20GB Digital Locker at Amazon's Cloud Player service so what the hell. :)Even at 99 cents it was definitely overpriced.
The music is brilliant.  This is a completely new sound for Mother Monster but it's so amazing.  Everyone should buy this album.
I'm glad I waited for Cascada Original Me after listening to this CD at my friends house.  Every time he'd play a song 30 seconds into it I'd say NEXT.  I loved Lady Gaga's first album what a disappointment this was.  Say what you want about Cascada but that bad can keep up with there previous albums.  This album makes me think The Fame was a fluke.
I'm pretty amazed at all of the negative reviews based on the downed servers due to the excellent deal Amazon offered on the 0.99 Lady Gaga album yesterday.  Sure the album is exactly what you'd expect poppy pop.  Exactly what my girlfriend wants.  But the download worked perfectly well for me (was streaming it on my cell phone a few minutes after purchasing).  This 5 star review is strictly to help counter some of the skewed ratings offered by other customers so far.
"Stefani Germanotta is a fabulously attractive and talented singer songwriter and musician. But Lady Gaga has turned into a walking talking Halloween billboard for herself. I liked Gaga better when she was mysterious and somewhat a part of this universe.If ""Born This Way"" had not been so over-hyped and ""leaking"" out all over the internet if the videos had not been so far behind the songs that were released this might be a somewhat enjoyable and maybe even surprising collection. But nothing could have matched the advance mismarketing hoopla. And so the let-down is big.There are more than a few songs on this album that play happily on and on in my head. After all she is the Queen of Hooks. However nothing really fits together. The CD cover is hideous the material is dark and solely meant to be controversial just for the sake of being controversial. It doesn't work as a package of art at all.I truly do adore Gaga but she cannot make a career out of pushing the envelope. It's dial-back time Stefani."
Lady Gaga can give me back my virginity and take it again. I love her.  I will be 96 years old asking for my Dr. Dre and Lady Gaga CDs
Great great deal! so excited!  It does take a LONG while to get the songs to appear (playable) in the cloud account but I cannot complain-- with all this traffic it's a miracle we get them at all!  Awesome deal thanks Amazon & Lady Gaga :)
I liked about 3 songs on this cd. The good thing is that I didn't have to pay for it but the singles that were released on the radio were the peaks of this album for me. I'm a huge pop music lover but this album just didn't really do it for me.
"Ok so ive always liked Lady Gaga but I was never a big fan.  This album is seriously blowing my mind! The beats and melodies mixed with dark and uplifting electronic beats are so purely enjoyable.  Can't really depict the best songs because everyone is going to like some more than the others according to their likes but I'm really enjoying ""Marry the Night"" ""Goverment Hooker"" ""Hair"" and ""Sheibe"" but the other songs are great too! Some people are skeptical about this album simply by reading the tracklist.. its so weird! But honestly you just have to open up to the songs and enjoy for what they are and the stories they tell. Music Passion Gaga."
Excellent customer service with a beautiful product all that i've wanted before. You have to have it into your collection.
born this way speaks out so much not only for some people but there is something in there for everyone. money well spent.
Well im not a big Lady Gaga fan but i do like some of her songs my mom like her so when i got the email stating i can get the whole album for .99 cent you cant beat that. Even tho i had problems with downloading at first do to the high demand didnt sweat it took a while but i finally got finish downloading the album. For some reason instead of paying the .99 cent i only paid .37 cent for the whole album i guess some other promotion cant beat that Huh. My mom loves it her favorite song is Born This Way.
After seeing the deal previewing the music and reading the reviews with problems I've come to two conclusions:1) The new album is definitely different and I while I don't think it's quite as strong of a showing it's still solid - especially for $0.99!2) Amazon needs to moderate comments/ratings when there are known technical issues on their end!People should not be allowed to give 1 star ratings on a product simply because of issues on Amazon's end; That does not contribute to the product rating in any way.*EDIT* 5/23/111 PM EST I should also clarify that I have purchased the album and have so far only received 6 items as well.6 PM EST - Just received order confirmation receipt email so things are slowly moving ahead just have patience people.5/24/11Have received all files as expected.  Will updated with further album review once I can listen all the way thru.5/25/11 - Full Album ReviewAfter listening thru the whole album I have to say I like it better than I did from just listening to the samples.  Overall it comes across as another successful adventure in new sounds and song styles and has a distinct sound that separates it from The Fame/Fame Monster.  There don't seem to be as many stand-out songs at first pass but it may grow on me the more I listen.  I will revise my review if I change my mind along the way.The album has a very 'big' sound is somewhat whimsical at times and covers a whole range of styles:Upbeat club/pop; Driving darker electro beats; 80's synth-pop; Even a Ballad thrown into the mix (You and I) - This one almost has a country sound to itI am keeping my original star rating for the album as I feel that artistically it deserves 5 stars.
My 8 year old loves the lead singer and  listens to her when we go to the gym. She doodles in her sketch book and plays in the play area to the beat. Some of the songs are even on my iPod!
Lady Gaga's much anticipated follow up to her very successful two albums lives up to its bombastic hype. The music is uniquely gaga and the conceptual themes of the songs in this album are unified and consistent. Her videos have been controversial. The messages that the songs convey are acceptance (Born This Way) individuality (Hair) and a celebration of differences (Bad Kids) against authority and accepted norms. She has clearly used this angle very much in her marketing and more importantly defining who she is as an artist a fashion icon and an activist. Additionally the religious references (Judas Black Jesus/Amen Fashion) are consistent with her message of love acceptance and redemption. Interestingly the more interesting songs from the album (eg. Government Hooker Sheibe Edge of Glory) have neither to do with fashion religion or diversity. Her music draws much from the 80s pop and has strong rock influence - despite the obvious comparisons to Madonna in controversy and in fashion she clearly has crafted a very unique sound and identity that is distinctively hers. She's not a ravishing beauty but she clearly talented and has mastered the art of the media. More importantly she has brought performance art to a new level with her music and music videos. She clearly has packed many grand thought-provoking ideas into this album. Great conceptual album and I am looking forward to her next album !
This album has a variety of different songs featured on it and I always find it interesting when I hear a track and it's a little different than the last. Gaga rarely if ever disappoints and this album proves it! My favorite songs (in no specific order) are: You and I ScheiBe Americano Judas and Marry The Night. Get it here because compared to my local ad Amazon has the cheapest price! Target wants $14.99!
buy it  it was  so  good  every song were the best &#65292;and  the fame  the  fame monster  love it so much
This has to be Lady GaGas best this album will be long to be remembered the songs all have their own unique sound and it just overall is an album with so much variety for just about anyone. From song 1 to 17 it feels like as if youre on a journey dancing your way to the finish line the album's title brings each song to the surface making the album much more meaningful and fun this is one of her best and its only the beginning for GaGa it makes me more excited to see what she has in store for the future
I'm not a huge fan of Lady Gaga but I'll be honest for $0.99 I couldn't pass it up.  I didn't have any problems downloading the album.As for the music itself it's better than I expected.  On some tracks her voice is annoying but the beat/music is good enough to make up for it.
I purchased this cd and love it. It takes time to appear on cloud drive. Song by song. Just hold your horses it will be there. This is a great deal.Edit: I really did buy from amazon. I didn't see a link to get verified purchase.
This album is amazing and has a positive core message of loving who you are throughout the album. And boy is it one sonic thumping pounding rush! Stand-outs include the mega bangers: Marry The Night Government Hooker Sheibe Electric Chapel Edge Of Glory Bloody Mary and so many more! This is one mean cool yet uplifting record. The 80's are back with musicians like Clarence Clemmons from the E Street Band and Brian May (guitarist) from Queen recording with GAGA on this very album! Mega producers like Mutt Lange Red One and Fernando Garibay bring their A game. GAGA brought the heat! Anyone even slightly disappointed with the first couple singles (wishing this album has what made The Fame and Fame Monster such a dance-gasm) will love them once they hear they have such a amazing home and purpose in making the album a complete experience. Don't worry you will be dancing your hearts out Little Monsters and new fans alike.
Such a diverse album in all aspects. This definitely shows a completely different side to the great Lady Gaga. I see a good one or two more number one hits moving off of this album but there is probably a solid six tracks that will hit number one on the charts.  Many of the songs have the potential to become great remixes as well.  I can easily see this album giving Thriller a run for it's money as one of the most successful albums of all time.  If not she's setting herself up for success on the next one.
"Let's face it...the album has been SO incredibly hyped up over the past few months that I think anything she put out would have been HIGHLY criticized and really wouldn't have lived up to most people's expectations. If anything it was definitely overkill and it probably hurt the album more than it helped it.The album as others have mentioned is quite different from The Fame even The Fame Monster in a lot of ways. She's going for a darker pop/dance/electro sound with a bit of retro 80's pop mixed in...which is fine with me. I'm not gonna sit here and dissect and over analyze every song as others have already done a much better job at that than I ever could. I personally think the majority of the tracks are awesome. Some are of course better than others...personally the standouts for me are Marry the Night Born This Way Hair Schei&szlig;e Bloody Mary Bad Kids Heavy Metal Lover and The Edge of Glory. It's difficult to pick favorites though as I love pretty much all of them. However I think we can all do without the grating over the top mariachi sounds of Americano.The bonus tracks for those of you who bought the expanded edition (and why wouldn't you?) aren't bad...my personal favorite is Fashion of His Love as it's definitely a throw back to early Madonna she even sounds like her. The others are fine but you can really tell why they're bonuses. I'm actually a little frustrated with the other 2 bonuses (Black Jesus + Amen Fashion and The Queen) as I can just imagine how they SHOULD have sounded they could have been great with just a bit of tweaking and perhaps a bit of restraint. As far as the remixes go the only even slightly enjoyable ones are Born This Way (The Country Road Version) and Fashion of His Love (Fernando Garibay Remix)...the others are basically not even worth a listen in my opinion.My only real complaint is the production...this is what lead to my 4 star rating as opposed to 5. I DO think SO much was put into almost every song that her vocals tend to get lost at times. Gaga is definitely an ""everything but the kitchen sink"" kinda girl when it comes to her music and this sometimes leads it to feel like a bit of a mess. So yes I think a major flaw in the album is that it's a bit overproduced. A lot of the time it doesn't appear to have a very clean clear sound.I think it's a great album. Album of the decade? Definitely not. But I think that was probably a statement that should have been taken with a grain of salt to begin with as every artist would probably love to look at their efforts in that way. If they don't believe in it why should we? The Madonna comparisons in my opinion are ridiculous. Nothing is ever going to be truly original. Something is almost always going to sound like something else. I think Gaga has done an amazing job at weaving together several of her different musical influences. You can see that she pulls from so many different artists and genres and she does it ALMOST flawlessly.In the end what we have here is an awesome sophomore effort from one of the most outrageously rawly talented performers and singers ever. A true artist who is very much an inspiration on a personal social and musical level who has a vision that always commands attention. And I truly believe she does it all just by genuinely being herself. Sadly as I said before the album will be overlooked by a lot of people based on too much hype. I don't think she's gaining many NEW fans from this. It's never going to live up to everyone's expectations at this point. However Gaga has enough of her hardcore ""little monsters"" out there to make it a highly deserved success."
When I first got to listen to all those remix songs I was amazingly surprised that a pop dancing song can be remixed to something so epic. Every single song in the album is able to let you feel a totally different gaga. And it comes with the HBO speical which is a must collection for little monsters!!!
I tried to download this and it froze on and off all day when the 99 cent deal was released.  I got 4 songs by the end of the day.  Then it said my links had expired.  How do I get the rest of the album?  I've tried to contact customer service but no one is responding.
UNBELIEVABLE!!! This cd is amazing. I am def a little monster - Every song has a good beat and a true artistic nature behind it. Nowadays you don't see many artists writing their own music and every song was written by Lady Gaga. I am not sure why some other's didn't like this album but to each their own. This by far is my favorite Lady Gaga album. If you love Lady Gaga's upbeat dancy and DIFFERENT nature.....this album is for you!Happy shopping!!
I bought the physical two-disc special edition of this album so I can legitimately comment on the music itself rather than download errors from Amazon (unlike approximately one third of the reviews listed here). This album represents Lady Gaga at her finest an artist who has successfully matched and surpassed her phenomenal dance-pop brand to create music that represents who she really is.  On this album you will find a blend of familiar (yet excellent) pop tracks in addition to genuine rock ballads about human dignity and acceptance.  Aside from the typical favorites on the album (Born This Way Judas Edge of Glory etc.) I've enjoyed Bloody Mary Americano The Queen and Bad Kids.  All of the remixes are also quite good especially DJ White Shadow's remix of Judas.
Lady Gaga is my favorite artist. With every new album she proves that she is talented and entertaining. This album is eclectic and inventive. I'm always interested to hear what she will come up with next!
"Lady Gaga has done it again. This album has everything from dance to rock ballads. Each song offers something different for every listener. If you feel like getting up and dancing put on ""Born This Way."" If you need a song to mellow out to play ""Bloody Mary."" I've had this album since the day it came out and it hasn't left my music player since. Another plus is that you get so much music for the price. It is so rare to get a full album these days."
"Thanks to the daily special I (and maybe a few others) was able to get a good deal on this album on an impulse buy. Would I have bought this album otherwise? I never bought a Lady Gaga album before and perhaps I shan't buy another unless it's a sequel daily deal impulse buy. You go grrll! Keep it up!That's not to say I've never heard LG before. Of course I have. That's why I can say ""it's varied"" in my subject line. Some of this material has a rock beat. Another song has a fake sax (or maybe it's a real sax....imagine that!). One track even sounds like Shania.Anyway it's a good album. Worth my time and investment."
Disappointed in the album. Sounds like remixed hits from the 80's and 90's. Nothing new or innovative. Not willing to waste even $.99 for this recycled garbage
I love this CD.  She has a strong voice and a strong message.  In addition she is so colorful and I love her independent attitude.
This review isn't a review of the album but of the Amazon's digital music service.  I tried this as an experiment to see if I wanted to order more music this way but it only downloaded half the songs.  Still a deal at 99cents but not an experiment I'll want to repeat with a full-price album.
This album is so personal to me. It has good beats and nice lyrics. It deserves 5 stars. WAY TO GO GAGA!
I payed 99 cents for this album. Was worth every single pennyi probably would of pay the full amount I lalmost lll the songs on it she's awesome
"This album is entirely different that The Fame/Fame Monster.  If you come in expecting to hear another ""Poker Face"" you will be disappointed.  Open your mind when you listen to this album.  It's refreshing to hear an artist not repeat herself  -- Listen to the album for what it is...A Lady Gaga masterpiece. Enjoy it and do not be quick to judge whether you like it or not.  Yes some songs are better than others but it's totally worth purchasing and listening too multiple times."
None of the songs on this album will download. I REALLY hope amazon either refunds me my whopping 99 cents or lets me know when i can download this album without an issue.
Her best album by far. Every song is great and can be played on repeat! Buy it is you like Lady Gaga.
Took awhile but I finally got the album and updating my review to focus entirely on the album.Not a Gaga fanatic but like a lot of her singles and took advantage of the special offer yesterday to get the album at 99 cents. There were a number of songs particularly in the first 1/3 that had jarring aspects to them and would have benefitted I think from a little more time and editing. She's at her best when she focuses on pure pop music and less on theatrics that don't serve the song at hand. It's a fairly uneven album with some real bright spots in it.
"I did not experience any errors and was able to get all the songs.  For those of you who are missing some you really aren't ""missing"" anything.  I'm just mad they are taking up space on my computer at this point.  This album sucks."
The mp3 set comes with easily accessed amazon cloud coverage. Her music is scintillating racy yet soothing explorative lyrics and melodies. Loved her Christmas with Muppets!
I ordered this over 24 hours ago and yes I feel I have been patient. It hasn't even started to download and is just showing waiting with 0% complete. I too have downloaded from Amazon before with no problems but this is ridiculous. This is not the artist's fault it is Amazon's. This was a huge event as fans have been waiting and they have failed greatly ... as of now now competition for Itunes....yes they had the best price but am still waiting for the new album.....so wrong and they are not even answering the emails....I have sent four and no response. Great Customer Service....right?????PS Need to rate.....having heard some of the new songs on Fuse I can rate her product....as for Amazon's service and customer service....-0.
Thank you so much for the bargain price on this great album! I had to retry about half the songs but they downloaded after only a few tries. I am listening to it right now with no problems.
I picked up this album a few months ago and it turned out to be better than I expected. I had heard a lot of the songs on her first album played a lot on the radio so I was weary ot picking up this one but when I heard more of the songs I was glad to have it. I have listened to the album a lot in my car when I have to make a long road trip so it has helped keep me awake at night when I had to drive for 3 hours. My favorite tracks are Bloody Mary Government Hooker and Fashion of His Love. What I really liked about the deluxe edition were the different extended mixes on the second cd. Born This Way with the western flavor is a unique way to tweak a song. It was also the dance mix of Fashionista that got me interested in that song. When I first heard it on the album I did not give it a second thought but it ended up becoming one of my favorites. This album is worth listening to especially compared to a lot of the pop music that is released these days.
Once again Lady Gaga delivers a wide range of songs with unique lyrics in her up-beat style.  Always fun to check her out to see who or what inspired her latest songs. The two CD's will easily keep me awake on road trips.  Her CD's are never boring.
"This is probably Lady Gaga's best work yet. Almost every song is catchy and gets stuck in my head. My favorite song on the album is ""You and I""."
Once again Amazon comes thru with a fantastic deal..99 Cents for a full album with no tax it's a beatifull thing!!
So this album is amazing. I had to go buy it at Walmart today since Amazon does not understand how to let you have it the day you buy it. I think this was a marketing scheme for Amazon. Not impressed with Amazon. But Gaga does a great job on this album. It has a lot of variety and lots of good dance numbers.Update: Amazon actually let me download it a day later. My favorites are: Marry the night Born this way Judas Americano Hair Scheibe Bad Kids and The edge of glory.
Best Album EVER!!!Gaga Has Out Done Her Self Yet Again!!!Keep Up The GREAT work Gaga We LOVE You!!!xOxO LoveLittleMonsterBlogger Staff+HausOfricky787 Staff[...]
1. Marry the Night2. Born this Way3.Gov. Hooker4. Judas5.Scheibe6.Bloody Mary7.Heavy Metal Lover8.The Edge of GloryI love these songs on the first run. She is the best thing to the industry in a while. Come on MADONNA I need you to come back and put this girl in her place!!
The songs that have been released as singles are all fantastic but the other songs that fill this album are sort of meh...  &#34;Americano&#34; is the one track unreleased as a single that I'd recommend you buy separately but otherwise just buy the songs you like rather than the whole album.
I bought the album and the only thing I am able to access is the PDF Booklet.... can anyone tell my why I am unable to access the music?
Gaga out did herself with this record! Every song on the album is great with a few that really shine bright. Definitely a great record to dance to! And it also happens to carry a powerful message!
I mainly bought this because it was 99 cents but overall the album is just.. okay. I don't hate it but i certainly don't love it. Gaga didn't do anything really spectacular on this album.
Before Purchasing read this:I just purchased this album and encountered the same problem as others: it won't fully download. I contacted Amazon MP3 service and they are aware of the problem and are fixing the issue. BUT DON'T PASS UP THIS DEAL! We will get the full album in the next few minutes to hours.Like usual great music and for $0.99 a for sure buy. =)
I got 1 song. I thought I was to get the album. I WILL e getting my $ back. Too bad. I love GAGA
For 99 cents that was the only way I was going to buy this album. I hoping for the best but it really falls short. She is totally channeling Madonna in this one. Makes for a bible story in a crappy album.
Overall a pretty good album.  A couple of songs are wonderful but some are eh.  Still a great listen!  GAGA!!
I love Lady Gaga's 'The Fame' and 'The Fame Monster' and Born this way is no exception. The fact that she writes her own music is awesome. I love the 80s punk rock feeling of the music. Heavy Metal Lover is my favorite song from the album. Amazing job!
Purchased this through Amazon on the 99 cent offer. The download started quickly and worked perfectly with iTunes and Amazon Cloud.
This album kicks ASS. It is pure fun. Anyone who takes it too seriously is missing the point. This will definitely be nominated for Album of the Year and Gaga has created a modern self-love pop masterpiece. Obviously it borrows heavily from musical history but that's the point. I can't stop playing it.

This is a great dance record with edgy electronic notes and great melodies. Its amazing how Lady Gaga did things totally differently releasing so many songs before the actual album release date and then totally releasing the whole album on youtube for listening. AND THEN offering this digital download for 99 cents. THIS IS MAJOR! very grateful for her openness
when i first heard born this way i was like this song sucks sounds just like madonna and everybody saying how orginal she is judas sucks just as bad the only good songs are marry the nightedge of glory and hair this album just sounds like she trying to hard to copy madonna and failed these sound like songs madonna left on the cutting room floor and lady gaga just pick them up and recorded them dont get me wrong i love madonna and own all her albums thats why i said these songs sound like something that she said these suck and dont deserve to be on my album this album is just plain boring crap
14 Songs for $0.99 awesome. Not sure how I feel about all the songs but when the album is only 99 cents how can I complain that much. 5 stars.Thanks.
"I'm not a fan of Lady Gaga but did fork up the whopping 99 cents to purchase this album when it was being sold that way on it's release date. That was probably a good marketing ploy to get non-fans to take a risk and buy this overly hyped artist of the moment without shelving out much money. Who knows maybe new fans can be drawn in.I enjoyed this album. If you have an excellent sound system at home which I do the album shines on that. It's got a heavy club sound to it lots of bass and thumps techno-dance infused rock anthems abound. If you can even mix all those genres into one. She does. Some finer tracks like ""Americano"" which has a flamenco-latin-rock lace to it will no doubt be a big radio hit.  Lady Gaga has an incredible voice that she rarely showcases but does so in ""Americano"".Amidst the deliberate religious messages that abound due to the backlash she receives over her vocally loud approval of gay rights is evident in a very understated and amazing cut called ""Bloody Mary"". One wonders if she's attempting to be the deity to the thousands of young people looking to be accepted.  Regardless its one of the best tracks on the album even if there may be some slight homage to Madonna's Like A Prayer era.  She also shows her fun side in tracks such as ""Hair"" a tune that will certainly be a gem in the clubs.  In addition Lady Gaga was clearly a product of the 80's as she pays homage to bands like Journey Depeche Mode and even Bruce Springsteen."
This CD was a good buy of course its Lady GaGa. I just had to have it as soon as it came out. I liked the idea of having a digital CD and not buying the physical CD itself. While I do like to have CDs to collect and own this was a good and instant way to get my music!
"It has been a very long time since there has been an album that I don't skip a single song when listening to. I think that Government Hooker and Scheibe have to be two of the best ""getting ready to go out"" songs ever created.  I listen to the album every day and never get tired of listening to it.  I am already thirsty for more Gaga music.  Perhaps an acoustic album next?"
I was skeptical at first and to be honest turned off by most of the songs ... but you've gotta listen through. It actually has grown on me. New and different which is actually refreshing in our post Rebecca Black musical landscape.
LOVE this album! Pumping beats make it hard to stay in my seat when driving to work. She is amazing!!!I LOVE YOU Mother Monster!!!
It's exactly what I was expecting from lady gaga. Great club music! I'm supposed to be studying for finals but this just makes me want to get up and dance!!No problem from amazon when I downloaded this on opening day hope that was fixed for everyone else who gave this a 1 star due to downloading problems!
downloaded for me in all of 5 minutes even though there is a warning on the page now about possible delays. i'm not sure what people expect- it's a buck of course there are delays! excellent music- love me some gaga. what an awesome deal made my day.
I cant explain how much Gaga wowed me with this album. Completely different from everything that's out there. Definately a MUST HAVE album!
I'd never purchased anything not from Itunes and was worried this would be a pain to import into Itunes. It was a breeze! I saved the songs to the cloud and then after downloading the Amazon MP3 downloader I check marked all the songs and clicked on download. The songs were automatically imported to Itunes and they play flawlessly. The whole thing took less then ten minutes. I had no server/download issues. Wow! This was a steal!!
First time using cloude AND buying from amazon ... i only got one of the songs and the book (though all others are listed there and grayed out ... what happened?
The is CD is definitely Lady GaGa at her best! Every track is worth listening to. Looking forward to more Lady GaGa releases.
Ive never heard music by such a mainstream artist in recent times that is just so painfully bad. Everthing about this album is designed to draw you in; from the crazy titillating artwork to the interesting song names. But dont be fooled upon first listen you will realize how crappy this music is. Dont be surprised if your ears bleed. This album literally is garbage. Its production is over-produced and its lyrics are fetid. The main regret I have is not having purchased the physical copy of this album so I could've at least thrown in in the dumpster where it belongs. Absolute Filth.
Let alone Lady Gaga is amazing but each and every song on this CD is amazing. They make me want to dance they make me think and smile. Thank you Lady Gaga!
"Yes I'm disappointed. I think Gaga's problem was she rushed this album. Alot of great ideas but the poor girl didn't have time enough to execute them the right way. This is my breakdown.1. Marry the Night-Ohh I like this one a lot. The chorus is rad. But...there is something missing to this song. I feel like it's not ""finished."" Could've been a hit if Gaga added an extra special element to it.2.Born this Way-No. This is bad. What in the world was Gaga thinking when she recorded this? The better question why didn't her team tell her this apes ""Express Yourself?"" So many questions no answers. Bottom line this song sucks.3.Government Hooker- This is what I'm talking about. It's like I'm being transported to a London hipster club circa 1991. The beat is sick. The bridge will be stuck in your head forever. My favorite off the entire album.4.Judas-Oh this one. Look I know Gaga tried to give us Bad Romance Part 2 but it doesn't work. The sad thing is it's not a bad pop record. But it's not good either.5.Americano-Techno. Horrible Spanish. No hooks. Mariachi band. No explanation needed.6.Hair-This is when the preachy cheesy bad 90's sitcom-intro music starts to kick in. To start with the lyrics are really bad. The melody is ok but the production collapses the whole thing. Will not listen a second time.7.Schei&szlig;e-This is something I could dance to for sure. But it's not cohesive. For an audiophile like myself I listen to every nuance of a song even if it is a dance song. It sounds like to me this was originally two separate songs mashed together.8.Bloody Mary-I like the melody and production but the message of the song is grating. Again it has a religious theme. So tired so trite.9.Black Jesus/Amen Fashion-A throwaway. I understand why it was a bonus track. Nothing special.10.Bad Kids-Another dance number. Another preachy attempt to bind together destitute youth.11.Fashion of his Love-The absolute worst song of Gaga's career. This is horrible. I'm thinking that maybe this is a gospel song with a throwaway mid-80's beat. Sounds exactly like ""I wanna dance with somebody"" in the worst way.12.Highway Unicorn(Road to Love)- I don't feel either way. I don't love it but I would listen to it again.13.Heavy Metal Lover-Well the title sure is misleading. No metal elements to this song at all. Pure Techno.14.Electric Chapel-I do not like this at all. Sounds just like Kylie Minouge circa 2002. This is bad. The song has no message. It is dead.15.The Queen-The third bonus track. I can see why it's a bonus.16.You and I-A good song but gosh I've been hearing it for the past year now. There is no mystique to this song. Just another 80's inspired power ballad. yawn.17.The Edge of Glory-Great message. Tightly executed song. But like a lot of things on this album it's just boring. This is a fan favorite but I don't like it all."
I absolutely love this album. You can pretty much dance run or workout to every song so it's in heavy rotation during my workouts. I really enjoy the differences in the songs. From Elton John style piano to house beats with borderline dub step breakdowns to Pop it really has it all. Even my 54 year old mother loves this album!
love gaga and love this album me and kids jam to it in the car. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
For 99 cents the album is a great deal. Definitely worth it. I purchased before everybody else noticed this at 6:30 am. At this time Amazon's service was awesome. The album downloaded in less than 2 minutes. Thank you Amazon.
This comment is for Amazon and not Lady Gaga's album primarily. These kinds of deals are exactly why I quit buying from iTunes 2 plus years ago. Amazon has the same selection but better prices. I've downloaded numerous albums from Amazon and only once had a problem and had no problem downloading this album today. The one time I had a problem with my download I did the option where you put in a phone number for a customer service rep to call you and instantly someone was calling me and in 2 minutes I had my problem resolved. As long as Amazon keeps the competitive pricing kick a** deals and awesome customer service I'll always be a loyal customer. In my opinion every other company could learn a thing or two about how to run their business by looking at Amazon. I felt I should help offset some of the negative criticism everyone is complaining about on here.As far as the album itself I would rate it somewhere around 3.5 stars so far. After a few more listens that could change.
Gaga is brilliant in more ways than one! The album is a masterpiece a great mix of songs. Making it $.99 is Lady Gaga's gift to all of us. I hope everyone enjoys it!! #PawsUp ;)I love Lady Gaga!!!
i like allot of songs from this album. the quality is clear i don't have any complaints at all. giggity!
OMG I LOVE AMAZON for this offer...flawless download for me and I got the entire album downloaded and automatically added to itunes within 5 minutes! AMAZINGGGGG
I have loved Lady Gaga right from the start and Born This Way just makes me love her even more. I don't know what else to say other than you should definately buy this album.
Made us want to jazzercise dance at work this morning.  For 99 cents you can't go wrong.  Great value for great music!  Go Gaga!
In every way that one can be born she's done it coming through vibrantly and brilliantly even theatrically her voice nailing every note.  You couldn't ask more of a musician who truly loves her art and her fans.  Gaga you shine...or maybe you've outshone yourself here! Born This Way showcases a more mature and discerning artist at an escalating trend of development.  I love The Fame and always will...but this here goes beyond that larval quite competent Gaga to a full-blown metamorphosis of revolutionary rebirth. This is a lulu of a Gaga who channels everyone from Madonna to Siouxie Sioux on her very own terms surpassing herself and in her own way them.  My 20 year old daughter and I are both fans and we each bought our own copies!
"When I first listened to this album I admit I was not impressed but from further listening I have become to love it. It is much different than the ""disco stick"" gaga and that is a good thing in some ways. The best songs on the album are : government hooker edge of glory schibe and bloody mary. I'm glad I gave this album a second chance!"
"I have bought the item and I have 9 songs downloaded currently.  For those people who have only gotten a couple songs just be patient and give Amazon a chance.  I've downloaded several albums from Amazon mp3 in the last few months and the quality has always been great; don't give up on Amazon just because of their high volume for this album.About the music definitely worth buying the album.  I was planning on buying it anyway and I got the email and quickly accepted.  The songs are all great at least the ones I've listened to so far.  I definitely like listening to the full version of ""You and I"" rather than Haley Reinhart's (American Idol Top 3 Finalist) shortened version."
First off I wanted to point out to those that are reviewing the album based off the samples - they're only being played from the beginning of the songs and you won't be able to hear the more exciting stuff in the songs. Best to preview the whole songs on YouTube or listen to the 1:30 minute previews on iTunes rather than here.I've been listening to this album on repeat every since I bought it and I have to say it's a masterpiece with all of the songs together. You'll hear more darker European trance inspirations in a lot of her songs and she does it well. It's nothing like her Fame Era with the fun pop beats but it branches directly from her Fame Monster Era with her darker beats. I think it's a refreshing change in my opinion.If you're still in doubt about the album you won't lose much for 99 cents. And as stated before this is the Standard version of Born This Way and does not include the bonus tracks and is edited for explicit content [cursing in Government Hooker].
"Before all you ""little monsters"" come to her defense let me preface by saying I think that Gaga is a VERY talented person who puts out a very positive message. Be who you are not what someone else wants you to be. Now onto the latest edition to the collection ""Born This Way.""I was very excited to get this album but after the release of the ""Born This Way"" single I thought to myself ""Uh oh!!"" Not a big fan personally and it has NOTHING to do with the whole Madonna sound-alike story either. It depends on what Gaga songs you like as to whether or not you will like this CD. I personally LOVED her first CD and Fame Monster but this one doesn't pack the same PUNCH like her first CD. The songs are too artsy to me and some are quite simply annoying. It just doesn't have the same catchy dancy feel to it. Here is how I see it. If you went to a bar or a club two years ago and Poker Face or Just Dance came on the speakers even if you didn't like Gaga you were bobbing your head. I thought those songs were brilliant and I truly thought she was on her way towards 2 decades of success and dare I say be the modern day Madonna or Michael Jackson... To me personally none of these tracks have that quality to them so in my humble opinion I think that this was a slight step back for her. Don't get me wrong she isn't going anywhere anytime soon but I think she needs to incorporate what made her so successful from the first CD instead of trying so hard to deliever a message in all of her songs in a non-exciting way."
Soo soo good. Ive watched this concert many times also remixes awsome well done GAGA.I luv when she talks to the crowd not at them. If u buy this 3 disc set beware concert is included so i have 2 concerts now. I bought actual dvd of concert not knowing. Soo worth the money.
I just wanted to write a review of Amazon MP3 store and the new Cloud player.  I read a lot of negative reviews due to the fact that it was difficult to download Born This Way yesterday for $.99.  I also had difficulty but it wasn't because Amazon isn't a good place to get music.  What did people expect when they offered the new Lady Gaga album for 99 cents!?  I waited patiently and the whole album finally downloaded.  I also bought a couple of other songs with no problems.  This was my first Amazon music experience and I love it!  Way better than iTunes when it comes to price and selection.  My sister has used Amazon to download music for sometime and has had no problems.  I would ask those who had a bad experience yesterday to give Amazon music another try.  It's totally worth it and not only could I add my new music to my iPod I can also access my cloud player with all my Amazon music from any computer anywhere!
great album!!!!!!!! don't doubt about it. the vinyl version on double lp 180 gram is great too. buy it!!! the sound is great better than the cd.
Love the new cd.  It is amazing to me how much hatred the Lady can produce by being herself.  This cd is fun uplifting and original.  All the haters can choke on their venom.  I'll be busy dancing.
Actually zero Stars! After purchasing the album only one song and the digital booklet downloaded. I can't even access any other song on the cloud player. Amazon needs to fix this or reimburse everyone.
I enjoyed her first two albums. can't wait for her new one coming out this year. this is for any fan of hers.
Really enjoying the tracks. Far too many 1-star ratings from impatient folks who had to wait a few hours for all the songs to download. Really people rate the artist not Amazon.I appreciate Lady GaGa's message in many of her songs. Listening to Born that Way on my walk to the bus stop this morning and found a new spring in my step.All the theatrics aside she's got an incredible voice and there are some killer lyrics as well.
Woow! It's a relly awesome product! Born this way has great songs the remixes are extraordinary and the monster ball is an unforgettable experience!  Besides it is cheaper than buying every item separately.If you don't have yours yet get it now! :D!
"I loved Lady Gaga's ""The Fame"" album because the songs were so unique! This album is so ""blah"" to me. Seems like every song is the same tempo all thump-thump-thump clun inspired beats that get really boring after the second song.... or actually even halfway through the first song."
Shame on Amazon. I paid for this album and could not download any tracks. The linux downloader package is broken and the server refused to load the album to the cloud player or to allow me to re-download to my client PC. I wrote customer service and received a boiler plate response with incorrect information and no offer to fix the problem or allow access to the music I purchased. I feel ripped off.
This album revolutionizes pop on so many levels. Lady Gaga has changed pop FOREVER! This CD is so liberating and makes me feel so free and strong when I listen to it. The remixes are amazing and it's perfect in so many ways! Love it!
Bought it for .99 and I LOVE 10/13 songs. Keep up the great work GAGA. Agree with the comment about techno disco ish... It's very forward thinking so have an open mind.
"First of all I have to mention that I'm a proud little monster and I love Gaga with all my heart.I have waited for this album almost half a year and I have to say that the waiting was worth it.After I bought the CD (I bought both regular and special edition) I put the Disc in my computer and listened to the whole album and the second ""The Edge Of Glory"" ended I burst into tears of happiness and proud.And now there isn't a day passing by without me hearing the album.I Love You Gaga!Thank You."
i feel that this is a wonderful ablum :-) the music really stands for everyones right. I am so happy with this and i want this to go on forever
I am sure there are many like me; I have never failed to be disappointed by the singles that Lady Gaga puts out.. nor am I never NOT entertained by her fashion or the things she has to say.I thought she was just another senseless pop singer but after listening to her on an interview on VH1 she is very intelligent and very passionate about her music. This made me like her more and I began to think of her as a future icon comparable to Madonna if she remains on the road she is going.I have never purchased a Gaga CD but after all the publicity on her song Judas and the reviews on Amazon I decided to give it a try. Again Gaga hasn't disappointed me.This album is PERFECT for working out. Most all of the songs are upbeat and all of them have a strong message for the topics that Gaga is passionate about.Some Favorites that MUST be heard:*Marry the Night (great great great beat. If this doesn't pump you up while running I don't know what will)*Born This Way (actually reminds me of Madonna with an amazing beat and very catchy lyrics.)*Schibe (she starts by speaking German which threw me off but the song is sassy and again another great working out song. Love the lyrics: If you're a strong woman you don't need permission.)*Hair (I especially love the chorus where she says This is my prayer I'll die living just as free as my hair. Again another pump up song.)The rest of the songs I had to listen to more than once to really appreciate them but I am definitely coming around.If you need a good pump up CD for working out or just to get pumped up for the night this album is the right choice :)
Majority of the songs are are great! She has grown lyrically and sonically. She sang her ass off on each song . The album would have just been perfect with the exception of 3-4 filler songs. It's all great though overall :]
Lady Gaga has topped herself once again with her extremely inspiring album Born This Way. Where The Fame was typical pop and The Fame Monster brought on a really edgy darker vibe Born This Way offers a complete new twist to pop and it's so inspiring. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes pop music Lady Gaga or is just looking for a different side of pop music.
People please don't give the album a bad rating because of amazon's server issues. You're only making it seem like the album itself is bad which its not.I called tech support and the reason for so many failed downloads is because EVERYONE is downloading this album so its backing their servers up I couldn't even get ONE song to download.overall a good album however :)
"""BORN THIS WAY"" is the Greatest album ever This is Lady Gaga's best work!! My top songs are ""The Edge of Glory"" ""Judas"" ""Government Hooker"" ""Marry the Night"" ""You and I"" and ""Born This Way"" ""Hair"" ""Bloody Mary"" ""Bad Kids"" ""Highway Unicorn"" just to many good songs this album will become Lady Gaga's best ever!! I believe the song ""Born this Way""will become Lady Gaga's ""Stairway to heaven""!!!"
Bought this whole album for 99 cents. Got my moneys worth. The album doesn't sit well with me really. It's just..blah. I'm still listening trying to like it..but right now it's only gonna get two stars from me. Sorry Gaga.
This album is fantastic. Very different from her previous albums a good kind of different. This will definitely be an album that people will remember.Best Tracks..Marry the NightBorn This WayGovernment HookerJudasHairScheibeBloody MaryBad KidsFashion of His LoveYou and IThe Edge of Glory
"After listenng to ""Born this way"" and ""Judas"" before the album was released I thought ""OK these two are the best songs of the CD and I'm sure there won't be anything even close as good they're just too good""...........WRONG!!! The songs are amazing one after the other you'll find yourself listening to it again and again. ""AMERICANO"" is the absolute best song. Bravo GAGA!!!!!"
"Simply put this record is beyond words...Gaga has in one fell swoop cemented her stature as a serious artist on a mission one with a future and one for the ages...and you really get the impression that as great as this album is she will be soaring to even GREATER heights as she evolves over the years.  ""Born This Way"" is both sheer perfection and humanly IMperfect...you really cannot ask anything more of the greatest artists and Gaga is now slam-bang in the group of the greats...I even love her more than Madonna who did not write much of her early work not even ""Like A Virgin"" but Gaga's written basically everything (songs released AND unreleased) and she's a MUSICIAN playing multiple instruments and composing since age 4 plus she's a visionary who turns everything to gold that she touches and she's FASCINATING...college courses were made about Gaga and fame.  Plus she's a social advocate and is a really sweet person who exudes good vibes and she knows how to throw a party.But this is about ""Born This Way"" Gaga's 2nd REAL album...""The Fame Monster"" was an add-on EP to her great debut ""The Fame""...and she's so far ahead of everyone else in the pop stratasphere that I can only imagine how the copycats will attempt to catch up now!!  They have their work cut out for them for sure.  I love that at the root of Gaga's music is a living and beating hard rocking heart she's no pop tart at all and those hardrocking elements have come to the fore on ""Born This Way"".  Here's the breakdown of the rocking AND eclectic ""Born This Way""...the full 17 track version...not counting the remixes on Disc 2 which are hit & miss.1-- ""Marry The Night""...10/10...great catchy opener with a nice chorus that would work on pop radio...great fullbodied vocal by Gaga.2-- ""Born This Way""...10/10...even tho it was highly exposed it's still a great song with a great message...even tho there are similarities to Madonna's ""Express Yourself"" I love BTW even more it's more satisfying a song and Gaga wrote it.3-- ""Government Hooker""...10/10...wow I love this song the operatic vocal with the pingponging club beat...it will throw off EVERYONE which cracks me up just thinking about it...nice lyric about JFK too.4-- ""Judas""...10/10...wowza...my fave Gaga single to date from the odd structure that works the hard industrial feel mixed with catchy pop that epic chorus...it's just creative it works and it has cool provocative imagery what's NOT to like??5-- ""Americano""...9/10...I really like this song this mix of flamenco latin club and pop...it's not as good as AZ's Roger Clyne & The Peacemakers' catchy rocking song from 2004 of the same name but it could work as a mashup together???  Someone hop on it pronto maybe I will??  Gotta figure out how.6-- ""Hair""...10/10...the first of 2 songs on BTW featuring Clarence Clemons from Bruce Springsteen's E-Street Band on sax and it's got a great new wave feel melody chorus message vocal...the works.7-- ""ScheiBe""...10/10...OMG...one of the coolest songs on the album and the intro IN GERMAN is similar to the English breakdown on 'Judas'"" bridge...listen and compare same metre...but it's just COOL and epic and dark and catchy as hell...pretty cool song idea too...LOVE it!!8-- ""Bloody Mary""...10/10...freaking awesome...has a nice oozing slow gloomy dramatic Doors/Brecht feel that is just epic played loud...I can just picture a cool remix of this official or not in the future...maybe I should attempt this too??9-- ""Black Jesus + Amen Fashion""...10/10...the first of 3 bonus tracks...LOVE it and the purchasers of just the regular 14-tracker are really missing out...it has this utterly GREAT dark gothic death disco feel like Sisters Of Mercy or PiL's ""Death Disco""...typical Gaga subject matter but picture a black runway nice.10- ""Bad Kids""...9/10...the first obvious rock-influenced cuts with a nice riff but it's a nice counterpoint with Gaga's softer vocal side she sounds compassionate with misunderstood ""bad kids"" who act out in their families and society in general...it's nice and melodic and not skippable at all just not my afve on the album still a good song though...and shows this album has VARIETY.11- ""Fashion Of His Love""...10/10...bonus track #2...sounds like a cooler pop song version of Blondie's Deborah Harry's first solo hit ""French Kissin' In The USA""...reg version buyers are missing out with this.12- ""Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)""...10/10...cool dancerock track with epic feel AND lyrics without feeling heavyhanded or cheesy a feat in itself and contender for best songtitle on the album.13- ""Heavy Metal Lover""...10/10...would have been cooler if this song sounded like a METALLIC song in the vein of Metallica Nightwish AC/DC Iron Maiden the Wildhearts Motley Crue etc instead of dark synthpop a la Depeche Mode but it works and I love the line ""put your whiskey mouth over my blonde south"".14- ""Electric Chapel""...9/10...sounds like a riff rocker but this song is the one on BTW that sounds the most like Madonna...from the song itself to Gaga's vocal if you closed your eyes and heard this song you would THINK you were listening to an unreleased Madonna track but it's Gaga and a good song regardless.15- ""The Queen""...10/10...the song I didn't like as much at first and seriously grew on me especually the chorus which is really good...funny this song is called what it is cuz of who guests on the next song...16- ""You & I""...10/10...featuring Brian May from Queen and produced by Mutt Lange who produced Def Leppard Shania Twain AC/DC etc and his influence shows...VERY Def Leppard and Queen and Shania/Mutt not as much Elton like in the live Monster Ball shows...nice change of pace.17- ""The Edge Of Glory""...10/10...wonderful wrapup of BTW...epic uplifting closer with CC sax solo #2...I first was under the impression this was going to be a cheesy ballad...NOPE...an epic uplifting melodic romantic new waveish pop closer...best album closer since the Cars' ""Dangerous Type"" in 1979.Grand and one of THE greatest albums of all time regardless that I am a Gaga fan...an objective point of view...one for the ages."
"Great unique stuffdefinitely not the regular poppy stuff as the first album was but it's really intertesting music and I personally love it.Particularly the song ""Schiese"""
Who doesn't love a Meat Dress? This album is awesome. Def give it a listen. At least borrow the damned thing.
there aren't going to be any # 1's off this album.it just doesn't live up to her previous work and i'm glad i only wasted 99 cents to get this.the music seems as cheesy as the album art work at least what i can stand to listen to.some of it just seems to much like finger nails down a chalk board to even try
I love GaGa. This album deserves record of the year! Seriously so good. I'm so glad there is a digital copy I could put on my iPod iPad and phone. Win for Gaga!Great for dancing.
"Well imagine my surprise to find this sweet gift of the entire album download (""just .99"" she said) waiting in my Inbox from my cooler-than-cool Mom! Yeah I'm old she's older (obviously!) but she knows that I too my daughter to see her last summer and God does that woman LOVE A DEAL! Issue- I click on the link to download and it takes me to the actual page to ""buy"" it.  :(  I'm whinning here because no one in CS has a good answer me other than ""wait. I understand all of the slow download issues I mean come on! This Lady's gotta lotta little monsters all revved up and Amazon is practically giving it away. I tried going in backwards on it by ""returning gift"" but it doesn't recognize the  order # that came in the email. Wah! I want my music! Thanks for listening!"
I must admit i fell into the lady gaga hype. I like her old stuff better and was not all that pleased with this cd.
Amazon backs their products and everyone who orders this today will get it for $0.99. Great album... had to wait a few hours for all the songs to download but what an incredible deal. Enjoy!
Hey guysI've read your reviews and I hope that the Amazon server is just under issues and that amass delay in the tracks is the reason why you ain't getting anything.If you've bought it from Amazon MP3 but it's not coming just download it from iTunes if you can spend the cash or download it online since you've bought a copy already.I hope everything works out and maybe a little patience will do it all. I'll keep looking.
I am a huge fan of Lady Gaga and was thrilled to see the whole album for 99 cents! I've only gotten 5 of the 15 songs but I have no doubt that in time Amazon will fix this problem! Great deal!!! I love what I've heard so far! Thanks Amazon!
A Kid's Review:So after Gaga's successful debut studio album 'The Fame' and her 8-track EP 'The Fame Monster' we have her newest effort 'Born This Way'. I have to say I loved all the songs it takes a few listens to familiarize with all of the 17 new songs + the 5 Remixes making 22 tracks to familiarize with. I finally got the opportunity to review the new songs here it goes:Disc 1:1- MARRY THE NIGHT - This is a nice opening track with a nice beat that you will for sure enjoy. 10/102- BORN THIS WAY - This is the first single on the record and of course the one that most identifies it with this nice anthem that makes people love themselves and who they are because they were born this way. 10/103- GOVERNMENT HOOKER - The start for this song is really weird but it's also very funny and the chorus has good beats. 9.5/104- JUDAS - Second single on the record when you love someone again and again even if they keep on making mistakes. 10/105- AMERICANO - Very nice song loving the Spanish lyrics. Not the best though. 8/106- HAIR - This is the promotional single for the countdown to Born This Way. A nice song loving the sax. 10/107- SCHEIBE - Love the German lyrics I just love Gaga singing in German. The music is also amazing. 10/108- BLOODY MARY - This is my favorite song for sure the chorus is beautiful the best slow song on the record. 10/109- BLACK JESUS AMEN FASHION - Kind of forgettable for me. 7.5/1010- BAD KIDS - 9/1011- FASHION OF HIS LOVE - Gaga sings about someone she's sure she was made to love. Cute. 10/1012- HIGHWAY UNICORN (ROAD TO LOVE) - I was expecting something more epic to come out from that title but still 8.5/1013- HEAVY METAL LOVER - The chorus is addictive. 10/1014- ELECTRIC CHAPEL - Very sweet. 9.5/1015- THE QUEEN - 10/1016- YOU AND I - I really love this song a sweet slow song near the end of the record. 10/1017- THE EDGE OF GLORY - The best closing to the record about the last moment on Earth. This was the perfect third single can't wait for the music video. 10/10Disc 2:1- BORN THIS WAY (COUNTRY ROAD VERSION) - I like this version but it doesn't beat the original. 9/102- JUDAS (DJ WHITE SHADOW REMIX) - This is ok. 8.5/103- MARRY THE NIGHT (FERNANDO GARIBAY REMIX) - Amazing remix to this amazing song. 10/104- SCHEIBE (DJ WHITE SHADOW MUGLER) - Way too long. 6/10 (I could have given it 7/10 if it wasn't so long)5- FASHION OF HIS LOVE (FERNANDO GARIBAY REMIX) - Another incredible Fernando Garibay remix. 10/10So that's pretty much it. Mother Monster's new album doesn't fail it may have some forgettable songs but it still gets 5/5 or 10/10 in my average rating.
i am a massive gaga fan so of course i was thrilled to have born this way but i have to say putting my fanaticism aside and looking at it from a purely musical perspective it is a phenomenal work of art.  to have so many different sounds not only just on one track but throughout every track on the whole album is almost unheard of.  i don't believe anyone working today has the creativity or involvement in their own music that gaga has.  i love the entire album and can't imagine it without the three tracks that are not available on the regular version.  you must buy the deluxe to really get a full picture of what born this way has to offer.  some of my personal favorites are government hooker bloody mary heavy metal lover but all are excellent and this is hands down the best album i've purchased all year.
This album is fantastic. It's not the same music of 'The Fame' and 'The Fame Monster'. This time Gaga used breathtaking lyrics and powerful instruments. If you haven't hear it yet I recommend you this album!
Gaga delivers. You can see her handwriting on every single piece of this album - if that's what you wanted to hear than please buy this album and rock on!
Gaga is a great song writer. She sends a great message. Its simple... Accept everyone for who they are and let people live on their own as they want to... She wants everyone to accept themselves... This is a good album. The music is fresh. It motivates you and makes you want to move.
"I am a Lady Gaga fan and I was anticipating this album.  It would have been like the second coming of Jesusas Lady Gaga would put it but it all spiraled to a flood of repeated beats (I am an atheist anyways so all the religious reference on this albums are bland).  The only savable beats are ""Government Hooker"" and ""Bloody Mary"" which I am currently listening and totally digging but thats it.  It's been six months in waiting and kind of disappointing in fact this year music has been disappointing.  The end of the world should have been last Saturday if music isn't going to get better.  Of course Lady Gaga can't do wrong with all her outfits and crazy performances.  Her videos however have been wacky to say the least I think I should take over and show her some worthy films that would be awesome to lay tribute in her videos."
If you're expecting Gaga to rehash what she did in The Fame/The Fame Monster then you probably won't like this record. Gaga has crossed into new territory submerging herself into hard industrial beats the 80's europop and church instruments? While this combination may sound like a disaster at the very least she should be credited for being a pop visionary. I honestly had to warm myself up to Born This Way when it first came out feeling it wasn't as catchy as the singles in The Fame Era. After hearing the album as a whole though I'm impressed since I find it extremely refreshing bold and cohesive. This is an album that is fit for an epic 80's film while at the same time possessing a contemporary edge that you don't hear on pop nowadays. No worries you can definitely dance to this album and there are a few slower midtempos - The Edge of Glory is impeccable - so if you approach this album with an open mind then I think you'll be surprised at the hypnotic journey Gaga creates in this impressive new album.
I left the downloader program running ALL DAY yesterday and I still only got eight songs. I guess eight songs for 99 cents is a good deal but still the advertisement was for 14 songs. Now the downloader is telling me that my order has expired and that I can no longer get the songs that I have in fact paid for.Great idea to give it away cheap. Terrible execution. Amazon wasn't prepared to handle it and the end result is that the customers are treated like dirt.Surprise me Amazon. Fix this.
I love Lady gaga's born this way album! 99 cents for the whole album is such a great deal! my faves are boody mary edge of glory electric chapel and you & i. I love Lady gaga.
Born This Way is one of the best albums i have ever listened to. this album is way different then the first one but way better. It has a mix of 80's Pop and rock. its a way darker album but good. personally my favorite song is You and I. The album is well written and directed.
"This album is a piece of art. It has ""dance-y"" songs (Judas Schei&szlig;e) it has sexy songs (Heavy Metal Lover) and it has songs that make you fall to your knees and worship the woman. (Government Hooker Marry The Night Yo&uuml; and I The Edge of Glory). If you haven't ever heard this album I really sugguest you do.-Liam ""Little Monster"" Mac"
"I purchased this CD because I love the songs ""You and I"" and ""The Edge of Glory"" from watching the videos via Internet since June 2012. I wanted to hear more Lady Gaga songs and the songs on this CD don't disappoint. I work in health care and strangely enough these songs inspire me in my work and make me more productive in what I do."
Just a little patience people. So many people are buying this album the server is a little slow. Besides it's a dollar for an album! The download wait is worth it.I wonder how iTunes is after Amazon owned them.
awesome album. Gaga has done it again! by looking to the past (80's) she makes it her own. This is the album of the future. Go gaga!
I don't know why but it would not download and said to try it again but when I did no download was there.  How do I get what I purchasred?Born This Way
excellent cd
"First off if you are having trouble downloading the album try re-downloading the ones that didn't download the first time. I had to do it twice but I have all the songs! So don't whine until you try that it's a simple fix!.Okay really enjoying this album so far I really like Bad Kids and Schei&szlig;e as the songs I haven't heard before. Just got done with work so I am listening to it now. Currently on Heavy Metal Lover.Gaga has such a great voice and a great ear for sounds and beats so far everything has blended together awesomely! I really enjoy listening to well-made songs instead of songs that try to sell something or pretend to be ""cool"".....I recommend this album! If you get it today you will only spend .99 cents for the WHOLE album like I did can't beat that! What other artist has done that? None!"
Lady Gaga has done it again by continuing to amaze us with songs inspired by Prince and Madonna. A great album for those who like to dance!
Lady Gaga teased us with this album since 2010 and we were at our wits end come the release on the 23rd of May. Songs were leaking everywhere but I remained patient and waited until it was available to buy in stores. I wanted to have the album in my hot little hands rather then a ripped version from the internet.I can still vividly remember my reaction to hearing the title track Born This Way when she released it earlier this year. I was expecting a slow meaningful and heartfelt song and instead I got a 90's inspired dance track which was passionate and embracing. I sat outside a bar in Cronulla and cried when I first heard it I knew she had created another number one hit.When I got the album I was so excited that I ran home. Finally FINALLY the album had dropped and I could listen to it on repeat. Firstly I love the flow of the album the songs mesh together perfectly. The first track Marry The Night fits perfectly with Born This Way following it up second. I screamed when Government Hooker started so dirty and will be a summer anthem is she chooses to release it as a single. Another track I adore (and probably my favourite from the album next to Born This Way) is Fashion Of HIs Love. The song she wrote for McQueen is a track worthy of Whitney Houstons vocal range.If you haven't already listened to this album I highly recommend it it is my most played album of the year!xxx
"I must admit I was not a fan of the Lady when she was born. I have to say this upfront I am in the older age bracket not her typical fan age. My son is a true follower and he asked me to give her a chance and just listen to the music and not the person or character singing. I did as he asked and I do have to say that I do like the music.As far as the persona goes I thought about it and realized that she is just this generations Cher Madonna Grace Jones or whomever was the out there person of that time. Most of us at one time or another had that one ""out there"" celebrity that we idolized and she is this generation's idol. We may not agree with her on some social issues but she is a person like the rest of us who has the right to speak her mind and support what and whom she wants.Do like I did and give her music a chance you may not like every song but I am sure you will find a few that you will pat your foot to."
"I'm 50+ yrs. old and became a die-hard Gaga fan when I first heard ""Just Dance"" two years ago while flipping through my Siruis channels in the car and I just bought the Special Edition CD of ""Born This Way.""  The first time I listened to it with my headphones on to catch every note I wasn't sure how I felt about all the tracks - two I already knew from the radio some I thought were good some I was unsure about. Then I pulled out the lyrics listened again and sang along - I am now addicted to this ENTIRE CD!  The music is fantastic I hear 70's 80' 90's and 21st Century influence throughout.  She goes from pop to punk to gospel and a lot of heavy metal sometimes all in the same song.  She sounds totally different from song to song yet still all Gaga!  The lyrics are amazing I love how she interjects a quick line of goofy humor and her own craziness while singing about love and life.  She takes tiny bits from some songs past and present and puts them into other songs so you feel her songs are all connected to each other.  I also love that I am able to make my own interpretation of what each song is about (""Government Hooker"" -a jab at my ex-NYS Gov. Spitzer perhaps?  ""Bad Kids"" about P. Hilton and N. Richie in their day?). Who knows I don't even care to know the real meaning of the songs (I know some people who have to) because having my own makes it so much more fun for me and this whole CD is fabulous and fun!  Don't take the songs too seriously (like the Catholic League...) enjoy the music and definitely listen to every word.  I dance and sing through the house to it and my husband thinks I'm nuts because he thinks Gaga is nuts but I can't get enough of Born This Way!"
To me this is the album of our generation. It speaks for us and about us. There is so much more to it than catchy beats like some of her previous work on The Fame and earlier. The whole thing is just so deep and meaningful it is about everything we need to talk about. Everything we need to get across to our Government and to other people who are holding us back. She is our voice; the vehicle of our thoughts and of our words that always seem to be forgotten and pushed aside. This album sets us free.
THis is a really cool box set! It is a definite must for any Gaga fan. The packaging is really cute and the content is worth more that $25. It isn't even christmas and I am already feeling the christmas joy from this amazing box set! Happy Holidays! This Gaga set just made my day... and week... and month!
my baby girl just loves lady gaga. she would have all her cds if I would let her. give it a listen
the cd i received was in a cracked case which i could have easily cut myself on. The cd itself was scratched and had a chip in one side. i would absolutely not recommend this purchase to any of my friends.
"First and foremost - Shout out to Amazon & Lady Gaga for a ""monsterific"" deal.I am not an official ""little monster"" but really enjoy her music.  I happened to stumble upon this deal when I was on Amazon for another purchase.  I couldn't pass it up!!I bought it and got back to work - I know good things take time...Thanks again - Amazon & Lady Gaga rock on!"
People are uploading customer images of the Cloud Player and showing what downloaded into theirs and what didn't with additional Notes.  I LOVE THIS!!  BTW I'm having the same downloading problems as many many others.
This is truly an incredible album start to finish! Every single song is extremely dance-able well written and just plain fun! These are certainly the songs that you want to hear at the party or at the dance!
I got this album when they did a $.99 special for the whole album. I like almost every song on the album and would have enjoyed it just as much if I had paid full price.
There is so much packed into this album that it's impossible not to find a favorite. I admire Lady Gaga for incorporating different styles of music into her second studio album. She's one of the few pop artists out there at the moment who would be so daring as to add rock and roll-esque music to a pop album and the results are impressive.
One dollar for a day one album release?  That is $0.29 cheaper than a single off iTunes!  For once the legal way to download music is the easier way.  My cloud player has instant access to the songs and I downloaded them to my hard drive in roughly two minutes. Amazon provided 20 gigs of cloud storage at no additional cost and the songs are actually good!
"I'm not generally a fan of pop but when Lady Gaga hit the music scene a couple years ago I was absolutely captivated.  She had a way of delivering tracks that were powerful and catchy while also being edgy and mature at the same time.  I absolutely loved her music even though it isn't the sort of music I normally listen to at all.But with ""Born This Way"" pretty much everything I originally loved about her music was gone.  When I first heard the titular single my thoughts were ""Eh.  The rest of the album might be better.""  The I heard ""Judas"" and while not quite as strong as some of her previous work it at least captures the same style and feel and it actually is a pretty good track.  So when I saw ""Born This Way"" on Amazon for $0.99 I jumped on it.  It downloaded fine no problems whatsoever and I hit the ""play"" button...and I was completely let down.It seems that in many tracks she is trying way to hard to send a positive message generally along the lines of ""Feel Good About Yourself!"" and ""Yeah Girl Power!"" often expressed in lyrics of comparable levels of artistry and subtlety (or lack thereof).Furthermore the songs sound as if she's trying to catch the 6-8 year old age bracket.  The musical style on many tracks is the musical equivalent of the Simple English language setting on Wikipedia.  It doesn't challenge the listener and while technically well-produced lacks the daring and maturity of her earlier work.  It's almost like her producers told her ""Listen that Bieber kid has the six year old market nailed down why don't we try to get into that too.""I absolutely loved Gaga's earlier work and I really wanted to like this album but it was painful to listen to.  Judas is a good track and others are bearable to decent which is why the review got two stars (although the horrendous ""You and I"" nearly dragged it down to one star on its own).But the edge is gone the artistry is gone the daring is gone and all that's left is what Thomas Pynchon would call Muzak."
"I admit that didn't have high expectations for this album when I first heard the title track back in February. I had feared that GaGa had finally ""jumped the shark"" but after hearing more of the songs I have definitely changed my mind. The songs are good and I only had some of the downloading issues that others have had. What worked for me was to go back to ""view your digital orders"" view the order launch the Amazon Cloud Player again and click on the songs that were not successfully downloaded the first time."
I ordered Lady Gaga's new album because I have a deep and abiding love of Gaga. It's something I can't explain but my love of this woman's music runs deep. I did not like either of the singles very much but I decided to give the rest of the album a chance.I've seen a lot of bad reviews of this album and after listening to it for three straight days I'm not sure I understand why. This album is a lot different than the first two yes but why would anyone expect this woman to follow up with something similar? She likes to keep us guessing after all.Born This Way is darker than either The Fame or The Fame Monster and both of those had their darker moments. Born This Way is a deeply personal and political view of Lady Gaga's take on the world and it is amazing.This album is all over the place musically speaking. It goes from slow building ballads to dance beats to rock to techno. It keeps you on your toes. It's all listenable though. Very dramatic and well put together. I have trouble skipping most of the songs.The lyrics are on par with what we've seen in the past possibly better. Some of them are more cryptic but it's all beautiful.Her voice has undergone some changes too. It has more range here. She goes from her booming choruses to her sweet verses and sometimes she screams it. Sometimes her vocal instrument is just dedicated to sounds that aren't always intelligable but always breathtaking.I don't regret buying this album. I would buy it again. I'mlistening to it right now like I've been doing since it arrived.
When I bought this album I knew nothing about her songs I am now a huge fan of hers and her causes and Every song on this album is GREAT and everything that GAGA has done with this album is AWESOME!
"I will make this short and simple. I downloaded the album with no problem thank you Amazon for the $0.99 deal it is unbelievable that someone would offer such a good album at the price of a song! Itunes sure was not offering ANY deal...The music is varied and different from her other material and that is a good thing from a growing Artist. The more I listen to it the more it grows on me and the songs seem familiar and fun. I will support Gaga as she explores different genres and not just expect her to rehash ""Just Dance"" over and over again. Bravo Gaga!! Thank you!!"
Born This Way definitely in the album of the decade. Unlike most albums today that have collaborations of modern day current artists; Gaga has taken legends of the past and brought them back. With saxophone pieces from Clarence Clemons and guitar instrumentals from Brian May this is definitely an album you need to consider buying. It has an 80's sort of vibe although it is very becoming. Gaga has once again changed pop music with this album and it is my favorite album I own. This is a purchase you  won't regret!
The entire album... ON release day... in digital format... for $.99?! I have died and gone to heaven.I had no issues buying downloading to Cloud Player (even though I'd never used it before) and downloading from there to my iTunes. Listening to it on my iPhone right now... &lt;3
I was worried about this album after not being in love with the lead single. Fear not. BTW the album is filled with instant classics for the dance floor. I will never doubt this woman again. Terrific terrific album.Also.....really love the remixes. Definitely worth buying the deluxe version to get them.
"I bought this album for 99 cents I was really excited but after listening I was pretty disappointed. The music is no where near as good as her first album. The only saving grace for me is that I do like ""Born This Way"" so I'm just going to pretend I bought only that song and try to forget listening to stuff like ""Government Hooker."""
"My cousin and I hang out together so her parents can have a ""date night"". One of the many things we have in common is that we like Lady Gaga's music so why wouldn't I snag the entire album for the price of a track I know we both love (""Born This Way"")? I can't wait to see the look on her face the next time I see her and I play the whole album from my netbook."
I bought this on Monday after receiving an email from Amazon that is was .99 for the entire album. What a great deal! I just am curious because both the audio and booklet are censored where there (I think) should be expletives. I'm not cool with Amazon posting a download of an album without informing us that it's the censored version. I want the original. Amazon if you post that this is an explicit version then please do all of us the favor and post that it is also a censored version so we know we are buying the right thing.Anyone else feel the same?
How else can i say this.... Lady Gaga ROCKS!!! Her music inspires so many people! This is the best CD ever! I have not taken it out of my cd player in my car since i bought it the day it was released!
I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is still watching and re-watching the DVDs. He LOVES it! He loves the behind the scenes in it. Of course her performances are awesome. A definite win for anyone liking her music!
I am no fan of Lady Gaga and I have no intention of ever listening to this music I just purchased. In fact I can honestly say I have never listened to a complete Lady Gaga song--the first thirty seconds are usually enough to send me out of the room. But seeing that this $0.99 purchase makes my 5GB Amazon Cloud Drive suddenly a 20GB cloud drive I decided to do it anyway.If I can find a way to do so I'll likely just delete the music and never miss it. But I'll gladly use the free space online for the next year.My rating is 3 stars for the awesome offer but minus two stars for the embarrassment of having to admit that yes I did once buy a Lady Gaga album. May the universe have mercy upon my soul.
"*UPDATE* After 2 years I actually became more appreciative to The Fame. She was more likeable to me during The Fame. Now it's just all gimmicks and pretentions. I'm not really crazy about this album like I was initially. I wasn't really fascinated with this era and its videos. For me I think she became less fascinating around The Fame Monster era when her videos and style started to get so ambiguous and pretentious. Her style was just so cool to me during The Fame. She reminded me of Gwen Stefani/Nicki Minaj. So funky and quirky. I wish she would go back to that. And her ""little monsters"" weren't merely annoying as of now.I was disappointed when I heard Born this Way. It didn't quite live up to the expectations even though I love what the message was trying to convey. I was relieved when Judas came around yet I was still skeptical about how her album would turned out to be. After playing Gagaville I heard the preview of the songs and I was ASTONISHED that they sounded that good. I decided to download the whole album to give it a second opinion. It was like I fell in love with the album overnight. I started to become hook in that I found myself listening it to it more than The Fame. Note to self...don't ever underestimate gaga! I think I went waay overboard when I said Born This Way is a VAST improvement of everything The Fame was lacking of and that BTW has more coherent deep lyrics as opposed to the superficial ones on The Fame.  It's true that I said that The Fame was no different from all those other partying/getting drunk/sex/electropop craze and that I didn't wanna hear anymore of that. BTW may have a lil bit more substance but I actually like the Fame era moreso than BTW. BTW may sound too dated to some people but it samples an amazing sound of the 80s Depeche Mode Cyndi Lauper disco early 90s and rock.  When I hear Gaga's spoken parts it does bring back memories of Madonna from the Like A Prayer/Blonde Ambition/Erotica era. I will not go on and on about their comparisons. I'm only here to discuss on what I thought about Born This Way. I am not going to display each rating track by track because it's long and most of the tracks sounded good to me. It has some minor flaws imo. There were a few I could do without. I will give an honest opinion and describe it the way I perceive. All the songs are mostly comprised of uptempos and midtempos. There aren't exactly any ballads.Great:Scheibe is one of the most played track on my ipod. It has an early 90s sound. It expresses its fondness over the german language and you could hear Gaga speaking in german. It reminds me alot like Madonna's Rescue Me. The chorus and everything....Black Jesus  Amen Fashion is saying that Jesus can be just as trendy as fashion. It has an early 90s/supermodel on the runway sound like Scheibe. This should have been on the standard edition.Bad Kids is about being proud of being a rebel and not caring about what other people think and their standards. It sounds very disco-ish. The intro gives out character and personality of the song.Heavy Metal Lover puts me in a trance in a way that I feel that it is soothing and makes me want to relax. I could hear elements of New Order.Electric Chapel channels Depeche Mode and Cyndi Lauper. It's one of the best songs on the album.Good:Judas has a religious tone in which it's about trying to step into the light while you're still clinging onto the darkness. That's where the metaphors start here. Some people were offended by this song and felt it was mockery and blasphemous. Others think it's a Bad Romance ripoff.Government Hooker is a tribute to all the politicians and their affairs. The lyrics say further on how she will do whatever you want her to do as long as she gets paid. I can't help it if this song makes me feel I'm at some disco karaoke bar. I could just literally picture myself being in one. It does make me want to step further into the naughty side and pull out a whip. The beats are so infectious that it gets me hook. It's a good song if you want to go out and get drunk with your friends.Hair takes me back into the 80s with it's soft rock and jazz sound. I could clearly hear Kim Carnes or Bonnie Tyler in her voice. Kim Carnes is the one that sang ""Bette Davis Eyes"" and Bonnie Tyler sang ""Total Eclipse of the Heart""Bloody Mary is the second song on here that has a religious undertone.The song makes references to the Virgin Mary and Jesus' Crucifixion. It actually feels very dark moreso than the rest especially when she does that distorted voice. I could hear voices of people in church. It may feel creepy at times to some people.Highway Unicorn could easily be played in footbal stadiums. I'm not sure what the concept of this song is all about. But I'm making guesses that it's about love conquers all.The Queen sounds like The Cure's music. I don't know what to think about this song.  I'm speechless at this point.The Edge of Glory is about reaching your final destination in life. I think having the saxophone and the soft rock feel adds to what this song is going for. It makes you want to feel more accomplished in life.Just Ok:Fashion of His Love is a cutesy kind of song written in tribute to Alexander McQueen who brought out the best in Gaga's clothing and made her visions came to life. Gaga mentions that Whitney Houston is her inspiration. I think I had found that in this song. However I don't really consider this my favorite.Marry The Night is about going after the things you want in life. Chasing after your dreams. She makes references to herself climbing to the top in New York. Not too crazy with the song ...nor the video.Bleh (songs I could do w/o):Born This Way is pretty much self explanatory. As the song states it's about coming into terms that people are unique and must to learn to accept themselves the way they were to made to be. Born This Way and Express Yourself do have their own similarities. The arrangement and the fact that they are both about respecting one's self. Born This Way grows on you. The beat sounds pretty bland and weak compared to the rest of the songs on here but I think it gets better towards the end. The ending feels special and intimate. I'll give +1 for that.Americano is something I don't hear too frequently. It reminds me of Tom Jones ""Delilah"" and it has this Italian restaurant feeling to it.  It tells a story about falling in love with a latina in east-l.a. It may seem over the top but I find it to be the most unique track on here even though it's really not my cup of tea.You And I is one of the songs on here I didn't cared for. It just never really stood out for me. Brown Eyes waaaay better."
This is a fantastic MUST BUY if you don't own any of her stuff. The Monster Ball DVD + The Remix CD + Born This Way DELUXE version all sum up to around $45+ if you buy them separate. Get it! You won't regret it! Also the Art cover is to die for ;)
People should not rate this album solely on their frustrations with amazon. I look at the 3 star review and I am wondering to myself how in the world can this be true? Then I read in depth and of course I see everyone complaining about Amazon's service server and download capabilities. Oh that makes sense. STOP GIVING THIS ALBUM BAD REVIEWS SOLELY BASED ON AMAZON SERVICES! This album does not deserve 1 or 2 stars. Just be patient and the content WILL be loaded. Patience is key.
I bought this when the entire album was $0.99 and came with 20 GB of cloud storage. It is a great album and even at the current $7.99 price it is a good deal even if iTunes charged more.
Born This Way is definitely a good album. While it's not even close to being album of the decade the majority of the songs are very listenable. A lot of songs fell victim to a sloppy beat / percussion section that made them sound chaotic and noisy not powerful like a good beat should. There were also a fair number of songs that could definitely be shortened a bit.On the positive side there's a lot of variety in BTW from metal to bubblegum pop. With 17 tracks everyone will find a few they love.  This album is a lot more ambitious than almost any other pop album. When everything comes together Gaga creates some truly great songs. It's just a shame that it doesn't come together as much as it could've.Favorite Songs:Bloody MaryJudasSchiesseYou and IFor a longer review with a track-by-track ranking from worst to best visit my review here: [...]
Great album i like every song though my favorite is Marry The Night and i still love that album cover.
I have never considered myself a real fan of Lady GaGa.  Since I ordered and received this CD I now have been converted to one of Lady GaGa's Little Monsters even at the ripe age of 60.  L really loved this CD!
I honestly didn't even get ONE song I got completely ripped off.I checked my digital downloads and it says I've already downloadedthe entire album which is not the case. Now it won't let me downloadanything. This is a complete rip off.
"I've always been a lady gaga supporter and really loved her Monster album along w/ other tracks she came out with. After hearing Born this way and Judas I realize I was no longer such a big supporter. I think the message for born this way is great but the video freaked me out. Not liking the songs coming out from her I decided it was not worth getting the album (even though I had anticipated it for months!). I even listened to the samples and decided""yeh for sure I'm not getting it.""Anyways long story short I got it anyways b/c hello it was selling for $0.99! I'm not going to say the album is amazing b/c I'm not in love w/ all the tracks. They all start to sound the same--very trance + pop. There are a few favorites like:-you and I (the closest slow piano song)-electric chapel (slow rockish)-Marry the night (pop and trance; very catchy)-bad kidsI wish she added some slow piano songs to make the album more diverse. I was able to download the entire album for $0.99 even though people were complaining about how this is a jip. Although it didn't download properly like most times. In fact the album kept downloading itself for at least 3x so now I have copies of the same songs 3x.Anyway I think this is a great deal for $0.99 cents. I don't know how she plans to make money selling like this but it was a great gift to give to her supporters/fans. Business-wise pretty smart to allow the product to be super affordable so that it sells enough to make it to the charts.And Lady GaGa fans need to chill out about commenting on people who give this album a one star. Some people love it some people like it some people don't. Everyone is entitled to their own opinions."
I got this in vinyl really just to display. It just looks so cool! I do have a record player and do buy albums I love in vinyl just to play them on it (include Johnny Cash Jimmy Eat World Loretta Lynn Coldplay etc) but this one is in a frame in my living room. Couldn't be happier!
except copy this way from great madonna and judas this album is a holy crap.far away from the fame monster.I don't understand why some monsters(most of them are 14 to 18 years old around) like GAGA because she is unique?really? dresses like a drag queen? talk like a monster without mind? Is this these little moster fond of her?Unlike the fame moster this album is a crap GAGA now mainly focus on how to sell albums how to make the numbers good how to attract people's attention with worse dressing is this really fashion??? ugly only this word can describe what GAGA has done now.Some may say GAGA has many followers on facebook oh come onthen why so many of them don;t buy her music?just because they add GAGA because people are curious about why many people add her.GAGA;s team now work on internet hire some people to write articles to praise herplease keep your eyes open monsters. Don;t just be a fool.Songs  in this album mostly sound like noise come on you guys you must admit that. I see some compliments on amzaon just can`t understand. Must admit the fame monster is good but this album? oh no.I think amazon's compliments contain some GAGA's hard coreso whatever this crap is the result in their eyes is good. Poorly sadyou monsters always said you have your own ideasbut this time you are misledreally indeed.
"I think this album reveals the spirit buried deep in GaGa. I admit is is not like her old stuff but if you have no problem analyzing music then this should be no problem. Her vocals are top of the notch on this album. Among the track list I would say ""Marry The Night"" is the best song on the album (to me). Her music now-a-days elevates from just being a genre of crazed popped out music and now has more of a meaningful rebellious feel to it. The album is filled with life messages really if you didn't note - the album is called ""Born This Way"" for Christ sakes.If your one of Gaga's MONSTERS (like myself) try it out it really is a great album!!"
"This album is a complete disappointment and shows no growth from her excellent debut The Fame/ The Fame Monster. In fact all Lady Gaga shows with this offering is that she's a poor reproduction of far superior artists that have come before her.Outlandish costumes and deliberately over-hyped controversy seem to be Ms Germanotta's forte. However perhaps if she placed less time on these aspects of her career and instead focused some much needed effort into her song writing she wouldn't have to heavily rely on blatant plagiarism.Gaga promised ""The greatest album of the decade"" and instead has dished up a tired and generic Time Life Warner '80s/'90s compilation album."
Oh please she is just terrific!!  What an artist she is!  You cannot help yourself from loving her beat!  Wow!
"I loved the Fame Monster release and listen to it quite frequently.To hear that Lady Gaga was coming out with a new album was a very exciting day.  Even more exciting when I got it for a mere $0.99.But even at $0.99 I felt that I deserved a lot more than the very pedestrian effort that this album received.  ""Born This Way"" was an excruciating cliched positive message that has been beaten wafer thin by so many artists that it rendered this song listless on arrival.  And it only gets worse from there especially with the somewhat obsequious use of ""gaga"" here there and everywhere.  Ok we know who you are...can you please get back to writing music worthy of ""Paparazzi"" ""Bad Romance"" or ""Poker Face?""What perhaps is more shameless is the apparent attempt to rake in enough sales in what could only be an attempt at saying that she sold xxxxxx copies within the first week...not on artistic merit mind you but on the basis of it being offered as cheap as it was on Day One.  I can't ascribe any other reason than this and it's purely an opinion on my part as there is the fact that Amazon is touting its Cloud network as well...but it still doesn't excuse the rather poor and abhorrent music that was released.  This isn't the same Lady Gaga who impressed me so much with her debut release is it?Apparently not.  I will be listening with caution with every subsequent release at best and reserve my purchase for the purely extraordinary.  Because this album isn't."
I love that Lady Gaga has included some poppy easy hooks and some new interesting different sounds. Doesn't sound exactly like all the other stuff that comes out from the pop world. Still very fun.
Born This Way (Special Edition)patience is what you need especially there's a lot of people downloading the album where else can you find an album for only 0.99? now it was just released yesterday and for less than a dollar! of course amazon will have some technical difficulties! back to the album i like it! so happy to buy it! now am gonna listen to it!
With all the hype surrounding Born This Way leading up to it's release one would expect it to be Lady Gaga's master work.  While in my opinion the album doesn't deliver Gaga's promise to her fans entirely as a whole it is darn good especially on repeated listens.  You can tell she worked her butt off these last few years.  There really is no denying that and Born This Way solidifies her unique place in the pop music world.  Haters call her what you will be it copy cat con artist or gimmick she isn't going any where any time soon.  And thank God for that.Stand out tracks are Government Hooker Judas Schei&szlig;e Bloody Mary Highway Unicorn (Road To Love) Heavy Metal Lover and Electric Chapel though I'd say I like all the songs.  Born This Way is a swirl of different genres be it europop bubblegum industrial 80's in general or metal and shockingly enough it all combines into a concise record that appeals to a wide spectrum of different tastes (I showed Government Hooker and Schei&szlig;e to a friend and while she doesn't like Gaga she loved those songs).  Compared to both The Fame and The Fame Monster it's her least mainstream but definitely her most interesting and most fun.  I'd say it's a step in an evolutionary process that fans will benefit from later on down the road.  Her art her presence and her outrageous appeal shine brighter here than ever before.After all that shining praise I do have to say I still don't like the song Born This Way all that much though I appreciate it's message.  The Edge of Glory is fairly forgettable though it's fun while it lasts.  And her influences show more here than they have in the past but that's alright with me.  Madonna Bruce Springsteen or Elton John-inspired tinges it doesn't matter.  She makes it her own.
I see that quite a few people had issues with their download after purchasing.I wanted to say that I had a great first experience yesterday with my purchase and The Clouse worked flawlessly.  My Born This Way digital songs were available immediately and are there to listen to or download to put on my iPod.  I am impressed and will use this service again.The Born This Way CD is EXCELLENT - just as her previous music has been.  Thanks Amazon and thanks to Lady Gaga for being the wonderful you and providing amazing entertainment to your Little Monsters!A Little Monster to the endMalcolm
Lady Gaga was born to slay!  This highly anticipated album truly lives up to the hype. From the very first track Marry the Night Gaga sets the listener up for the ride of a lifetime. Stand out tracks include Scheisse Bloody Mary and Heavy Metal Lover but with constant hard beats and catchy hooks Born This Way is a great listen from beginning to end.
THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST ALBUM THAT IS OUT. AMERICANO MADE ME LOVE LATIN STYLE MUSIC. GOVERNMENT HOOKER MAKES ME WANT TO DANCE LIKE A ROBOT. JUDAS JUST MAKES ME WANT TO GO TO THE CLUB AND DANCE!!BUY IT BUY IT!
Is a production that I found it boring do not feel that energy from the previous album you like from beginning to end I feel that the issues are very similar
This was the worst album I have ever had to pay for... Just goes to show my GF has no taste in music!
Terrible music.
How can i decribe this albuma lack of inspiration really poor melodiesthe best songs are plagiate from Madonna's workmusic under zero!
I was a little bit of a Lady Gaga fan before this album but still wanted to get born this way when it came out. Someone on here said it sounded like bands from the 80's including the Pet Shop Boys. (My favorite band) Every track on here was incredible from beginning to end. Singles like Born This Way and Judas club songs like Government Hooker and Scheibe classic rock like You and I and everything else. This is already in the top 10 albums all time list for me maybe even TOP FIVE.
Excellent song writing & mix of styles of music. Every song is interesting and carefully crafted. Great listen from start to finish.
"I've never reviewed a record (or anything) on Amazon but having read numerous reviews (by critics fans and haters) I for reasons unknown to me feel inspired/compelled to comment.The Gaga discussion/debate seems to revolve around three central elements: the music the message and the hype. I admit to being tired of the publicity/hype (an egg? eating note cards on Letterman? really?) but as a music fan I try to separate the hype from the music. As for a record's ""message"" it's a turn off if it's offensive or trite but for me the song writing the music the arrangements and the production are what matter.As for the music the quality of this album IMHO is undeniable. On the first listen the diversity of sound and themes is a bit overwhelming and perhaps off-putting. Upon further listening you see Gaga's growth as a song-writer musician and vocalist. She has never sounded better. My only real complaint about the music is that some songs are a bit overproduced but even so her voice still rings true.A predominant topic in discussions of this great record has been her musical influences. She has been accused of ripping off or overly copying everyone from Madonna (Born This Way) to Queen (You and I) to Depeche Mode (Heavy Metal Lover) to Bon Jovi (Edge of Glory) to herself (Bad Romance) with generic comparisons to Bruce Springsteen Bonnie Tyler Pat Benator and David Bowie. Taken individually these comparisons might give rise to the common claim of unorginality. Taken in total if accepted they demonstrate a truism of great music: great artists are inspired by the music of others and that inspiration is inevitably reflected in their music. (Personally I find the predominant influence to be Queen/Freddie Mercury...over the top performance mixed with an undeniable earnestness.) From my perspective she has fused classic rock with modern dance music in a way that is both original inspiring and utterly original.I could do a track-by-track analysis but others have done a good job of that already. To me one of the most lightweight of the tracks Hair illustrates the glory of Gaga. She takes lyrics that could be construed as completely juvenile (even infantile) and transforms them into something incredibly catchy and even quasi-profound. While a stronger song the same could be said of Scheisse. Even when she's lyrically inane she soars musically. I'm not sure about album of the decade but when was the last time you saw track-by-track reviews by critics? It's interesting to me that even the hyper-critical critics admit an affection for a few songs...and the songs vary from critic to critic. There's obviously something here for most everyone and isn't that rather than a universally cohesive and laudable message or ""living up to the hype"" what music is all about?"
I listen to this CD often.  The more I listen to it the more I love it. Lady Gaga is amazing and so talented. I just love her and her spirit.  Margaret Cardwell
album is ok but people that ship stuff must be carefully because the cd box was broken when i opened i was so excited to listen then i realized box was broken i'm very disgusted.
Even with the high volume of downloads I was quickly able to download the album.  First time I downloaded an album from Amazon.  Great deal for .$99.  You can't even get one song for that price on iTunes.  I was even able to quickly add the download to my iTunes library.
Great CD.  I love Lady GaGa and her music.  Great up tempo CD that can get you going.  Would recommend if you like her last CDs.
I love Lady Gaga she is very much a female Elton John. Her earlier two albums were fresh except for the titles were uniquie and fun. however this current CD sounds very Madonna esq. I love the song Judas but that is about it. her music is/ was fun but I beginning to wonder if she will have the staying power of an Elton or a Madonna. Good luck to her.
I cant believe she put her CD on sale for 99 cents!The only reason I'm rating this a 4 is because its not uncensored :/The album is different(STILL AWESOME) but it wouldn't be gaga if it wasn't.
Say what you will about Lady Gaga but I don't remember any artist in recent memory that created a CD in which each song has a different vibe melody and feeling. Most artists put out a CD of songs that all blend and sound the same but when you listen to Gaga's new album each song has its own voice melody and feel.I love the darker songs an amazing change from the fame and the fame monster and how she incorporates real issues into her tunes. No one else is doing that right now or has been for a while.I'll continue to support her as long as she keeps slaying keeps making amazing music and keeps fighting for the gay community and keeps being flawless.
Well i was hoping this would get in before my boyfriend and I's anniversary the 24th (yes thanksgiving). but it supassed my expectations and got in in very good time very pleased with my product:))
"I absolutely love lady Gaga's new record I especially enjoy that she took such risks on it.  I know not everyone likes it she very much went against convention on these songs.  I would argue that ""fans"" who hate Born This Way have missed the whole point of what kind of artist Lady Gaga is and therefore are not as much of a ""fan"".  Anyway I love it and a majority of reviews agree with me (that's all that matters)."
Enjoyed her previous work but the creative talent obvious in her earlier work is largely absent.  This album sounds like a desperately synthesized work.  IMHO it's tedious and a real chore to listen through.  If her next album doesn't show better creativity and value her glory days may be over.  But I'm hoping she returns to those initial creative roots.
One might think you could find at least one gem in this album load of commercial pop pablum but no there's just one droning tune after - it's like Gaga sampled all her previous work and put it in the proverbial blender.  Guess there was a reason that Amazon put this one in the bargain bin and what's up with the album cover - was Gaga intentionally going for the ultimate in fugly?
Gaga at her best!Had an issue with downloading but Amazon customer service resolved the problem in no time at all.
The music is and always will be as divisive as the talent. In this case Lady Gaga has people who react in one of two ways either she's horrible or they respect her and enjoy her music. I love how reviews are saying it's a step backwards. A step backward from what? The lady is 25 and has 1 1/2 albums under her belt. Love or hate her the music is what's most important and this album shows it. I think a major problem people are having with this album is the sheer scale of sound. Unfortunately most casual listeners these days are listening to music through subpar methods such as unfortunate car stereos or even worse the speaker of their cell phones. This album needs a soundsystem equipped to deal with noises of every possible octave and scale so those reading this review and for some reason hate this album hit me up I'll let you borrow a pair of headphones and you can take this album for a real spin. To all the other little monsters keep inspiring each other and to all the haters thanks for not coming to the next show and ruining it for everyone else. PEACE!
Is there an unedited version of this CD out there somewhere??  The one I bought (2 CD special edition)has bleeps in a few songs (e.g. Government Hooker)and even the booklet has black bars over the offending words?  Why would somebody do this on their own album unless it was for the edited version (Walmart??) although I see no mention of an unedited version being available.  Maybe that will be released after everybody buys this version first!
Love the ecstatic/religious tone of this album.  Lady Gaga delivers lots of dancey tunes but manages to slip her politics in between the beats.  Monster on!
"Well... I have listened and re-listened to the fabulous-ness that is BORN THIS WAY Lady Gaga's 3rd album. What a powerhouse Lady Gaga is. The entire Born this Way album is like GOSPEL... the truth from Lady Gaga. Gaga BRINGS IT... and we little monsters keep eating it up. I know I can't get enough. I love Gaga... She's proven she has the ability to outlast most of these flash in the pan so-called ""musicians"" and also that she has a lot of diversity in her music. She's a REAL musician... and that is rare when you have so many pop princesses out there that don't even write their own music. Gaga does that plays instruments dances and even more.Is there nothing Gaga can't do?Track by Track... here I go...Marry the Night - I could see the video in my mind as I heard this song play. It's very visual and beautifully written. I love the lyrics ""I am a warrior queen live passionately tonight"". 4/5Born this Way - Welcome to the anthem of this generation. This song is about being yourself despite the obstacles or odds. Beautiful powerful... we needed this song in this day and age. I absolutely love it... ""I'm beautiful in my way cause God makes NO mistakes I'm on the right track baby I was born this way Don't live your life in regret just love yourself and you're set I'm on the right track baby I was born this way"". 5/5Government Hooker - It's an in your face kind of song. You could take it as a political statement or as a fun song. 4/5Judas - When I first heard Gaga wrote a song called JUDAS... I was like WHAT?!?! I couldn't imagine what it could be like. Now that I've seen the video heard the song... it's beautiful. It has such a catchy lyric and beat... it'll entrance you. 5/5Americano - A kind of spanish/latin song. Nice to salsa to. 3/5Hair - ""Living just as free as my hair""... it's about being who you are and true to yourself. Being free to be who you are. Great track. 4/5Scheisse - HAHAHA. If you know German you know what this word means. If you don't... then get a clue. I love it. Bold Gaga. I love hearing her speak German. 5/5Bloody Mary - Another religious reference song. I was hoping she'd go for a HORROR reference... oh well. Nice lyrics but it didn't thrill me too much. Horror fan in me was disappointed no horror lyrics. (I am such a geek) 3/5Black Jesus * Amen Fashion - OH... MY... GOD. Work that runway... I could see this song on an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race and the contestants working that runway. It's a bold song. Bet it sturs controversey with the name... still it is a GREAT song. 5/5Bad Kids - Not really my cup of tea but I have to respect her lyrics. 3/5Fashion of his Love - This song is a change in Gaga's style... kind of soft for her. Nice. 4/5Highway Unicorn (Road to Love) - Ok some people show up to the Monster Ball with unicorns (see the HBO special)... I wonder if that inspired this song. But it is a very nice lyrical and empowering song. 5/5Heavy Metal Lover - Leather Lace ink and motorcycles... I can see the video now. I love that Gaga goes there. 5/5Electric Chapel - One of my favorites on Born this Way. It has a great beat to it and I could see it being played all around the world in dance clubs. 5/5The Queen - Another bold song by Gaga about being yourself... Be the Queen. Gaga is our Queen. 5/5You and I - I first heard this song on her HBO special... it had slightly different lyrics then. You could change ""NEBRASKA"" to just about anything if you sing it in karaoke. Anyway... it's a very piano oriented ballad-isque song and a change for Gaga... but her changes are always very good. It proves her range. 5/5The Edge of Glory - I love this song. I can see it being the theme for the Olympics. Very strong song. 5/5Overall 5/5 - Born this way is one of the best albums I have ever had the pleasure of listening to. I can listen to it all the way through and there are few albums I can do that with. I applaud Gaga for her range in musical style bold lyrics and awesome messages.GAGA You have a fan for life in me. I &lt;3 U!!!!!"
I just had the cd for a couple days and already it's the best cd I've bought this year and probably for a long time. I'm loving it and will be playing it for a long time. Even though it's the censored one (which sucks) only a couple songs need to be censored and I don't notice anything with it it's a great album I'm glad I got it.It kinda sucks that the second CD has remixes of songs on the first CD and it basically adds a bunch of heavy bass beats to the songs which I'm not into.  But I don't care I'll probably just pitch that one in the trash or set it out on the bench at the local convenience store for someone else to take maybe they'll like that one but I still got an excellent cd at a good price even if it was just one CD.  The other one is just a bonus but I love the main CD.
"I bought the digital copy of born this way when it was on Goldbox for 99 cents and I stand behind my purchase. I have been reading a lot of the other reviews that people have been put up and I decided to share my opinion of them:A lot of people have been commenting on how Gaga is the new Madonna. I completely agree with this. I am only 23 years old but I am a huge fan of Madonna. I think she was very creative and original for her time. But to say that Gaga shouldn't be like her or Gaga needs to be more original is like saying that after Mozart created his original symphonies Beethoven and Bach shouldn't have made classical music because Mozart already explored that territory. That just makes no sense to me. If you like a particular genre of music then I say the more the merrier!The next big comment was that Gaga is trying to do too many things at once. But I think the people that say this are forgetting something: since when does an artist have to pick 1 genre and stick with it? Gaga enjoys exploring different types of sounds and what she can do to personalize them. I personally am a huge Gaga fan but I also love Linkin Park 311 Eminem and Britney Spears. Why do I like such different types of music? Because each of them conveys a different message ( or no message at all ) and I listen to each when I am in the mood for it. If you like techno you will love ""heavy metal lover."" If you like Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"" then you will love ""Electric Chapel. She also puts in meaningful songs such as ""Hair"" and some of the struggles that she faced growing up in ""Bad Kid."" This album is a compilation of stories. The stories that she wants us to hear. And that's what i love about her and what most of her fans love about her.The last thing that has caused an uproar was the fact that Gaga is getting religious. I am also an Italian girl from New York and as such I understand what she is getting at. We were both brought up learning about religion right from wrong etc. Alejandro (from the Fame Monster) and Judas aren't exactly religious songs. They are more stories that Gaga is trying to get a different perspective on. This was never intended to offend the church or anyone else. Judas was merely talking about how she knows Jesus was right but she is still seduced by the evil that Judas has done and what he is. Again she's just trying to create another perspective. She is not making fun or offending anyone.If you are a person who likes autotune pop then this is probably not the album for you. I would suggest Britney's new cd Femme Fatale or Kesha's cd Cannibal. That's not Gaga. She creates meaning.Lastly to all the people who reviewed this album but did not purchase it and have always hated her why did you even waste your time writing a review?"
This is a good album by Lady Gaga. She had a sale on these when it first came out. She has great versatility and creates music in new ways that I have never heard before.  If you love this album you can also get a poster of Lady Gaga.  If you or your family has great sympathy for &#34;Born This Way&#34; as an idea everyone will love this.
"Gaga does it again! Born this way is a 5 star effort and well deserving. This will be a ""MONSTER"" seller for sure! Not only a great performer and artist but a great singer as well. Her acoustic versions of songs show how good her voice really is. Also did you see her on SNL? she was spot on. Could acting be next? GO GAGA!"
You know I love Lady Gaga I really do.  In fact I loved her so much that the day the album was released I WALKED over to the nearest Best Buy which has recently become my only means of purchasing anything entertainment related the walk was a good mile away but I persevered.  The only down side walking a mile home to listen to it.  Now the album I felt lost some of the edgy-ness 'The Fame Monster' brought back in 2009 the reason I feel is is because listening to 'The Fame' its pretty much nothing but hard hitting dance tracks so when 'The Fame Monster' came out people were more shocked that there were songs like 'Speechless' and 'Teeth' on the EP.  'Born this Way' almost feels like a climactic plateau of Gaga's entertaining and provocative bizarre-ness though it isn't bad.  The deluxe version does a good job of creating a good list of songs that you can just listen to.  Though to be all honest the album doesn't have the same replay value that 'The Fame' or 'The Fame Monster' has (of course that could be because I am in a Britney Spears mood as of late)As I am reviewing this there are 4 singles the two standard pre-release 'Born This Way' and 'Judas' and then the two post release 'The Edge of Glory' and 'Yo&uuml; and I.'  Which are 4 of the best tracks on the album.  Definitely playing to the albums strongest tracks and if you like those songs I recommend that if you haven't purchased the album yet get it.  The only other song that I would put into single form is 'Hair' but that is just me.Now lets talk bonus there is a plethora of bonus content in this version compared to the standard version.  Three original songs as well as an entire disc for remixes.  Now I am not one for remixes especially when they clock in twice as long as the original song and there are a few that do this.  If anything get the deluxe version for the 3 bonus tracks they are well worth it.All in all if you are one of the few people who haven't bought it and are wondering whether you should based on the singles I would recommend it.
after spending 4 hours trying to get my amazon downloader to actually start the download; I got it to download all but one song some how by dumping this album on America they think that it will make it popular. I love lady gaga I do. I just think that she has gone too far this album pretty much sucks.  She needs to stick to love game poker face alejandro just dance and bad romance.  There isn't anything appealing about a 24 year old that has some good values but then deems herself the Oprah of the youth. I dont want her to pick the president of the US tell me what to buy where to buy it what to eat or how to think about God. Sorry Gaga I am over it.
Unfortunately this is the censored version. I'd have waited on purchasing if I'd known that.  Otherwise excellent music despite Amazon glitching out and only allowing me access to half of the album... but since it was only 99 cents not that big of an issue.
"thinking that I was buying a pop CD as her previous album... But it sounds more like a gospel hating CD every track you can listen ""Jesus"" ""Mary"" ""Judas"" and many tracks are just the same more and more times (Merry The Night The Edge Of Glory Hair Born This Way)"
"I already bought this on an actual CD but then I saw I can get the entire album in MP3 form for only 99 cents AND an upgrade to a year free of 20 GB Cloud Storage on RELEASE DAY.  Not only is this promotion/price amazing on Amazon's part Born This Way is an amazing catchy album.  Lady Gaga has a lot of important things to say in some of the songs such as Born This Way but what impressed me even more was just how catchy and fun some of the songs were.  I'm not one to claim myself as a ""Monster"" but I will gladly put my ""Paws Up"" for this one.  Great job Lady Gaga great price Amazon!"
I don't like every song on the album but the ones I do like end up being played many times a day. I think this record showed good evolution and growth from her earlier work.
Can't beat an artist that creates their own music. The lyrics vocals melodies and production are all top notch. A+!
Very catchy cd my life listens to it all the time she never seems to get sick of it. Its one of the only cds that she doesn't skip songs she listens to the whole thing. Great CD not just one or two hits
I don't like this album.  =/  Good thing I got it for free with a promotional discount.  I am sad though because I could have used my promo for a good song instead of a junk album.
Once again Lady Gaga produces an album of TOp 40 hits and songs of actual quality. Keep it going Mama Monster!
First let me start off by saying that I'm a metal guy (I've played drums in metal bands for years). Never been into pop until I saw Gaga's Bad Romance video a few years back. It was the first time I thought of a pop song as a true artistic vision. I've been a Gaga fan ever since. With the release of Born This Way I think Gaga has really shown true growth as an artist pushing new boundries in artistic expression and really just being herself. For me metal has always been about being rebellious doing your own thing and having your own artistic views. I've come to realize that Gaga is pops metal equivalent and I love her for it. Paws up!
You cant go wrong for a buck. The album took about two days to grow on me. Its a slightly diffrent sound but give it a chance its pretty good. :)
"Lady Gaga has enthralled her fans becoming something of an idol within a career spanned over only a few years. She's entranced and occasionally alienated the public with her outspoken antics and (subjectively exciting) unusual way of dressing and her theatrical staginess have made her a voice impossible of tuning out.In her third studio album ""Born This Way"" does more than you would expect it to. First of all it's an extremely powerful sound that while not new for Gaga is something you can't easily ignore. Second of all it's much more eclectic than you would imagine it to be with songs featuring a Latin beat (""Americano"") her ""Evita"" number (""Bloody Mary"") her take on female empowerment (""Schei&szlig;e"") and one power-anthem with a vaguely country-western sound (""Yo&uuml; And I""). Incredible songs like these separate her from the Britneys or the Christinas or the Ke$has of the world. As many of you know Miss Stefani Germanotta writes her own lyrics and music. Being only twenty-five years old she appreciates and takes from the classics much more than you would expect a musician her age to do. She borrows from elements such as heavy metal and opera without compromising her signature sound.She also proves to those who don't already believe so that she is a musician not to be messed with. There's raw focused talent here. Lyrical talent and she proves that she has a powerhouse voice and an undeniably wide vocal range. She can go anywhere with her voice and she has just about one of the best in the business right now. If she didn't have such an affinity for elaborate stage shows she could sit on a stage with just her voice and a piano and could blow the audience away all the same. She's that good.The one bad thing one could say about ""Born This Way"" is that it's not terribly original. Gaga takes alot from music that has already been done but she takes alot from music that has been crafted YEARS ago. She nods  Whitney Houston in ""Fashion of His Love"" makes a big beautiful Queen-esque power ballad (""Yo&uuml; And I"") that you could easily picture a group of fans singing along in a crowded stadium waving their lighters in unison. There also isn't a standalone single in this album that would be thought of when anyone remembers this album a la ""Bad Romance"". These 17 songs are a collaborative effort each one of them bringing emotion gusto and something different to the table. Not all of the songs sound the same which is also something that can't be said for the Britneys and the Ke$has of the world.Here are the standouts in my mind in no particular order.1) THE EDGE OF GLORY - In my mind the best song on the record for many reasons. It's metaphoric it's extravagant it's meaningful and it's damn catchy. It's a song that you could easily picture being played in the clubs of the world because it has a peppy enough dance beat but there's a beautiful meaning behind it which is displayed pretty heavily in the song. ""The edge of glory"" means the edge - the cliff - the line between life and death. It's a song she wrote for her late grandfather after he passed away. The song even begins with a sound of a heartbeat and ends with that of a flat-line. It couldn't be more beautiful.2) SCHEI&szlig;E - ""I don't speak German but I can if you like"" she squeals. This song will haunt you and will be caught in your head for weeks and here is why. It's about female empowerment and how women feel restricted and as if they need ""permission"" just to be strong in their own lives. Part of the hook is in German and will be a hard to forget. It's an anthem for female empowerment. One of the best since Helen Reddy's ""I Am Woman"".3) THE QUEEN - This song is a standout because it begins with church bells -- CHURCH BELLS IN A POP RECORD! It begins as a pop anthem about a woman recapturing her identity. ""I can be the queen you need to be this is my chance to be the dance be braver you'll see"" she proudly pronounces. The song's last two minutes slow it down a little becoming a gorgeous ballad beautifully showing off Gaga's powerhouse vocal range with a beautiful guitar solo reminiscent of something Jimi Hendrix might have done.4) BAD KIDS - A big part of ""Born This Way"" is Gaga reassuring her fans many of whom are looked down upon seen as freaks and outcasts. In ""Bad Kids"" Gaga claims that she is nothing more than any one of her fans. ""I'm a brat I'm a selfish punk I really should be smacked. My parents tried until they got divorced 'cuz I ruined their lives"" she claims in ""Bad Kids"". She says alot in this song which may or may not be true but either way it's one of the best on the album.5) HAIR - This is the antidote to the in my opinion overplayed title single ""Born This Way"". Both songs portray the same theme to be proud of who you are no matter what and to ""let your freak flag fly"". However in ""Hair"" the dance beat doesn't become obnoxious. There's a beautiful saxophone interlude along with the highly quote-ready lyrics. ""I've had enough this is my prayer that I'll die living just as free as my hair"" she proclaims. That's a strong thing to say. I can really appreciate lyrics like these.6) YO&Uuml; AND I - I can't say enough good things about this song. It's a lyrically beautiful anthem about love lost and wanting to recapture what you once had. It's deeply personal more than likely about Gaga's relationship with her on-again-off-again relationship with Luc Carl. It has country and western and heavy metal influences and lyrics that remind you why Gaga is a superstar. Her voice soars in this song. It's ""Born This Way""'s answer to ""Speechless"" from ""The Fame Monster"". It's memorable as ever. It's been performed at Monster Balls around the world and it will hopefully be performed at every tour she does from now on. It's one of my favourites.HONORABLE MENTIONS: ""Marry the Night"" ""Government Hooker"" ""Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)"" ""Americano"" ""Heavy Metal Lover"" ""Judas"" and ""Electric Chapel"".And I could go on and on about which songs in my opinion are the best because these aren't all of them. Every song brings its own qualities and as I said it's a collaborative effort and none of the seventeen tracks on the special edition of ""Born This Way"" are to be missed. The remixes on the second disk bring their own special something to the table as well. The remixes are great for workouts and listening while exercising. Every one is a gem in its own way. Oddly enough the title track ""Born This Way"" which we've all heard by now is probably the weakest on the album. Maybe that's because I've heard it so much and it's worn on me or maybe it's not. Although I predict it's going to be a very long time before I quit listening to this album."
The album is different from Fame in a good way.  We all had gotten use to her sound and she didn't take her fan base for granted and just redo her past success.  This  album gets better with each listen and the insane price of .99 cents is crazy!  Born this way is sorta like an Ars Poetica and it's a full of all her influences smashing together to make on thing.  This is probably more about her then her last effort.  Enjoy.  Or don't and avoid it's a free country : )
I am an extreme fan of GaGa everything she does I love.  I love this album with the exception of one or two songs this album may be her best.  This album barely came out and I'm already excited for the next one.
Well I can't rate the music because it won't download.  As far as the process goes first off it's annoying that it won't work unless Safari is your default browser (personally I prefer to use Chrome).  I've bought it twice and tried the versions w/ and w/o the digital booklet.  Neither will even remotely begin to download and it's been 30 minutes. I've read all the FAQ and help topics Amazon has on its mp3 downloader but nothing has addressed this issue nor helped.  PLEASE FIX THIS AND MAKE THIS RIGHT AMAZON! :(
The songs are great and the download time was fast. I bought this when the whole album was 99 cents. What a bargain!
This album is one of her best albums yet I love almost every song on here and I love the hidden meanings some of her songs contain. The special edition is a great buy the remix tracks are wonderful and definitely worth it.
I've been a fan of Lady Gaga for some time now mainly because of her originality in this day and age. Yes some of her music is obviously influenced by people who have come before but that's inevitable. These aren't covers they are original works that if anything pay homage to an entire era of music.In a period where original Pop music is hard to come by - Lady Gaga delivers. Even though this CD is noticeably different than anything she's previously put out it shows she's actively experimenting with new material. I tend to be more disappointed when every CD that an artist comes out with sounds the same with different words and that is not the case here.For 99 cents this is a steal. Heck for 9.99 this would be worth it. It's upbeat fun uplifting music - that might get you off your chair while it's at it.Enjoy!
"Here's the thing...Lady Gaga has always freaked me out. Her crazy fashion sense and erratic behavior can be a major turn-off to many people. However this is a woman who is totally in control of every aspect of her life. She does whatever she wants to do and doesn't seem to care what other people think...how can you not admire that? And regardless of what you think of Lady Gaga as a person how can you not appreciate the genius that is her music? Lady Gaga is awesome! She is that perfect mix of pop and dance that is guaranteed to put anyone in a great mood as soon as they start listening to her music. ""Born This Way"" is no exception. There isn't a single sub-par track on this CD. Fave songs include ""Marry the Night"" ""Born This Way"" ""Judas"" ""You and I""...the list goes on and on! I just LOVE her...all the weirdness aside! She is probably the most innovative female artist since Madonna and she deserves mad props. I can't wait to hear what she comes up with next."
I just paid .99 for the digital booklet- no music like I was led to believe that I was paying for.. As a college student I don't have a single cent to waste but I figured what the heck how often can you get a CD for a buck? Surely I could skip lunch to get it. I guess the listening-dance party I was going to have today is not happening.
I'm no kind of die hard fan but I appreciate the fun and catchiness of Lady Gaga's music.  I'm happy to have a current album at such a bargain.  Thanks Amazon and Lady Gaga.BTW I had zero problems downloading and immediately listening to the album.
I think if she concentrated her strong vocals with songs similar to speachless from her previous album than this album could have been a fine piece of work.Instead shes really just an act a show.What makes this album different from all mindless dance albums ? Such a shame.Her career is done before it even started. And that album cover? What?
I heard that the album would be sold for $.99 and was so excited to buy it. When i went to buy it however it said it was only for people residing in the United States. I don't understand why it would say that seeing as i live in New York. I checked back multiple times and every time it said i couldn't buy it because I apparently don't live in the United States. I really wish they would make this CD available for $.99 again for those who experienced problems with purchasing it.
If the point of the 99-cent price was to get me to try Amazon's MP3 store it worked; if the point was to convince me to continue to use it in the future it was a complete bust.I was patient yesterday and last night when repeated download attempts resulted in failure; I'm less patient today now that Amazon's download software is telling my time has expired to download my purchase. Sent two e-mails to Amazon customer service so far; I'm still waiting for their first reply.I'll be happy to replace this review with one regarding the actual music but so far my experience is dominated by the fact that Amazon took my $1 and delivered roughly half of what they promised for it.
Lady GaGa has really proven herself once again with Born This Way. She has created an album that delivers the sounds of Techno Rock a little bit of Metal Pop 80's Pop and a touch of Opera. It almost seems as if it could appeal to everyone regardless of their preferred genre. The tunes are very catchy upbeat soft intense and a lot of them are radio friendly. Some of the highlights include Born This Way Judas Marry The Night Hair ScheiBe (club friendly) Fashion of His Love Black Jesus + Amen Fashion Electric Chapel The Edge of Glory etc... From what I've read she has promised us the album of the decade. I'm thinking this record will succeed. Well done GaGa! Well done!P.S.The vinyl creates an amazing sound for this incredible album. Pressed on 2 LP's 180 gram vinyl. Can't go wrong with that!
Gaga. Lady Gaga gave away this music for free for a limited time and what can be better than that. Besides her music is amazing
The first time I heard the Born This Way album I liked it. The second time I listened certain songs started getting my attention. After the third time I was hooked. There are so many things to like. Thumping dance beats infectious choruses and if you listen closely a thematic thread of self-love and empowerment running through all the songs. If you're a fan of pop music this fusion of 80's electronic anthems euro-techno  and 21st century dance rhythms is a must have.
Because honestly I don't even think this was worth a buck. This full album wasn't worth the cost of most single songs.
"This is album is nothing like Fame/Fame Monster. If you are expecting that then you willbe disappointed. This however is a great Euro-pop/rock album with typical dance beats.Here is a track by track review1)Marry The Night-- 8.5/10. This song is amazing. I dance to this one quite a bit. Lyricallyit sounds great and the melody of the song just puts you into a great place when you dance. Itsounds kind of Madonna-ish to me but that is not a bad thing.2)Born This Way--8/10....No Point going into this song. We heard on the radio. It's a great songto empower people who feel bad about themselves. Not her best but I just love the message in the song.3)Gov't Hooker--8.5/10....Quite frankly I don't know what the hell she is talking about. But it doesn'tmatter to me...It's a fun song to me. I find myself quoting ""As long as I'm your hooker"" quite often muchto my chagrin4)Judas--10/10....I love this song. One of the best song in the album. Awesome beat lyrically it is great andshe sings very well in this one. I love the metaphor of Judas from the bible to a real life Judas that I am surewe all have dated at one time or another....JUDA JUDA AH AH :)Judas sounds like Bad romance mixed with another one of her previous singles...I want to say pokerface.5)Americano--7.5/10....Again I have no idea what she is talking about. I originally hated the song because i hatethe way she sings it but I listen to it...It's fun. No clue what she is talking about but It's definitely a decentsong...The reason it's rated so low is because it is basically a 2011 version of Alejandro.6)Hair--10/10....She better make a video and this song a single. GREAT MESSAGE. I love the instruments in the song andshe sounds amazing.I too want to die living as free as my hair ;)7)Scheibe-9/10...No gaga you don't speak German but I like this song. People get over it. The Word Scheibe is a dirtyword i guess that means Sh** but I love dancing to this song...Great beat and I love the harmony/melody8)Bloody Mary--6/10....It's alright. I don't like her voice in this song. I listen to but it's annoying and monotone sounding.This is basically a rehash of Judas....Seriously...Listen to how she sings in Judas and then listen to how she sings. It's thesame tone...Same religious metaphor like Judas. Not too impressing9)Bad Kids-5/10....Ehhh I don't know what to say about this. I don't like it really but it's not horrible. The message andlyrics don't make sense till you hear the chorus but it's rather...flat10)Highway Unicorn--2/10....I don't like this song....AT ALL. It is annoying and yet another flat song. Her voice is being drownedout by the music and I don't like how i can barely hear her or the lyrics.11)Heavy Metal Lover--8/10...a fun song to kind of bop your head too. She isn't really singing so much as talking in this song but Ilike the beat and the lyrics.12)Electric Chapel-7.5/10....What the hell is an electric chapel? Idk...But I like the song. It's decent...Fun and she sounds great inthis song. I love her voice...very seductive and mesmerizing.13)You and I--8.5/10...What's funny is...i hate the song. Idk why I do but I do. However the lyrics are what made me rate this so high.I love the lyrics...the message is amazing but what I can't stand is the song. Idk. I think it's because this song would be great as aslow song but she actually messes it up by using the beats she does for the song. It's too rock to me.14)Edge of Glory--11/10....Yes this song is that great. After a few lackluster songs before it this song is a PERFECT WAY to end thesong. I LOVE IT! Awesome Beat Awesome Lyrics and this is a song that makes you want to dance and party it up.I think she wrote this song about a relative or a friend who past away so if you listen to the lyrics it tells a story.All in All a decent album She could have done better. I would have brought the Deluxe edition but from what i sampleld the songs werenot worth the extra money.I have been playing this album for 2 weeks now and it is listen worthy except for a few song"
My wife got it as a gift (from a co-worker) and she's already calling Gaga pass&eacute; after just a fortnight.Personally I enjoyed a few tracks but I'm just fine with her letting it go.
"Lady Gaga has become a household name by all means.  When her debut effortThe Famematerialized in 2008 no one knew who Lady Gaga was.  After The Fame launched mega hits including ""Just Dance"" ""Poker Face"" ""Love Game"" and ""Paparazzi"" Lady Gaga became something of a more daring bold Madonna.  ""Bad Romance"" cemented the iconic status finding Lady Gaga to be something of a spokesperson for the `everyman' who may normally be viewed as `weird' or a `loser.' Gaga's second full length albumBorn This Way (Special Edition)(excluding the Grammy-award winning EPThe Fame Monsterwhich is arguably just an expansion of her first effort) continues Gaga's ascent into pop culture stardom (She's definitely a queen).  An album that is as vivacious and ambitious as her first  Born This Way is a fine follow-up filled with a fine mixture of dance cuts as well as a couple pop and singer-songwriter driven numbers.  And face it who would have ever thought a dance album would have blown through 1.1 million copies its first week? Born This Way worth the hype? I think so.""Marry The Night"" starts of the album strongly with a grand opening by the dance-pop chanteuse while the verses carry an 80's sensibility that highlights Gaga's vocals.  The refrain is cutting edge finding Gaga belting: ""I'm gonna marry the night/I'm not gonna cry anymore/I'm gonna marry the night/leave nothin' on these streets to explore...""  ""Born This Way"" The #1 promo single loses no momentum  if for nothing more than Gaga's spoken word intro: ""It doesn't matter if you love him or capital H-I-M/just put your paws up/`cause you were born this way baby..."" The songwriting is clever and tasteful despite its liberated tone and the best line just might be ""don't be a drag just be a queen..."" which is chanted constantly throughout the number.  ""Government Hooker"" doesn't miss a beat thanks to solid production work from Gaga DJ White Shadow Fernando Garibay and DJ Snake.  The conceptual nature of ""Government Hooker"" (well for lack of better phrasing) sells it.""Judas"" one of Gaga's many biblical references throughout the effort is as solid all else notably for its driven production work and catchy hook: ""I'm just a holy fool/oh baby it's so cruel but/I'm still in love with Judas...""  ""Americano"" changes pace with multicultural (Spanish) influenced production much like one might hear on say a Gogol Bordello album.  The use of a mariachi band is certainly off-beat and clever.  ""Hair"" one of several valedictory moments clearly is a show stopper with inherent Madonna's influence.  The quality of the cut is more of pop-urban sound and the incorporation of saxophone cements it's neo-80's sound.  The hook is to die-for (Madonna would've killed for this cut): ""I've had enough this is my prayer that I'll die living just as free as my hair..."" German-gibberish cut ""Schei&szlig;e"" is another moment of brilliance if for nothing more than another ridiculous than catchy spoken word introduction:  ""I don't speak German but I can if you like...""  The hook also sells this cut: ""I wish that I could dance on a single prayer/I wish I could be stronger without somebody there...""""Bloody Mary"" changes paces smart considering the driving dance-feel of both ""Hair"" and ""Schei&szlig;e.""  ""Black Jesus  Amen Fashion"" is one of several bonus cuts on the Special Edition which is enjoyable but not necessarily a standout.  ""Bad Kids"" featured on all editions  is solid again finding Gaga honing in on her songwriting talents.  ""Fashion of HIs Love"" another Madonna-esque cut is just as effective with ""Vogue"" written all over it: ""Oh I'm seeing all the signs from above I'm gonna be the one that he loves I was made for loving him the fashion of his love..."" Vocally ""Fashion"" is one of Gaga's most enthused vocal performances.""Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)"" lays well particularly given the use of organ.  ""Heavy Metal Lover"" is a B+ cut but enjoyable.  ""Electric Chapel""  and ""The Queen"" (""The Queen"" only appears on the special edition) are OK but not the best.  ""Yo&uuml; and I"" restores accelerating momentum with superb songwriting by Gaga and exceptional vocals.  ""The Edge of Glory"" closes the album (the standard edition that is) with pep and a memorable inspiring refrain.  The Special Edition features five remixes:  ""Born This Way Country Road Version"" ""Judas DJ White Shadow Remix"" ""Marry the Night Zedd Remix"" ""Shei&szlig;e DJ White Shadow Mugler"" and ""Fashion of his Love Fernando Garibay Remix.""OverallBorn This Way (Special Edition)is as interesting as The Fame was.  Sure there may not be anything quite as shocking as say ""Love Game"" but there are plenty of `monster' gems that will be spun for years and years to come.  And face it Gaga is not growing any more normal.  A track like ""Shei&szlig;e"" which finds the chanteuse speaking in German gibberish should prove that.  4 stars."
I bought this album on iTunes the moment it came out I purchased a hard copy of it as well and it still is one of the best albums I've ever heard. I still find new things to love about it and it has been out for six months. The songs have a common thread yet share their own unique styles. Gaga's vocals are unmatched and are beautifully amplified throughout the great beats of this record. This is definitely an album for this generation and it's not going away any time soon.A solid piece of work Gaga. Congratulations.
The ratings on the album may be skewed only because Amazon couldn't keep up with all the traffic; so don't let a low rating scare you.  It's not the album that most 1-star raters have commented on... it's the inability to download the complete album as a result of spotty service.  The album itself in its entirety is fantastic.  Even if you're only a mild Gaga fan for the .99 cent sale there's bound to be something on here you'll love.  My favorites: Marry the Night and Edge of Glory.As for the server delays at Amazon run a Google search on the sale and you'll find it's already hit the news.  For 1-star posters please update your rating after the full download... it's not Amazon you're rating it's Gaga.
This is another great release from Gaga and even better that she and Amazon are practically giving it away for free on the day of release.  I find it laughable that so many are assigning 1-star reviews to Gaga's album because they feel cheated over what is obviously a technical glitch caused by overwhelming response to this offer.  Amazon will make good on the offer so it's time to stow your false outrage and temper tantrums and rate the product on it's merits as opposed to you feeling cheated out of 99 cents.
i must admit i'm surprised that lady gaga can really sing. This recording is turning into one of my favorites. Will surely  buy more of her cd's.
lady gaga's target audience is the gay audience and night club dance floors.  she's found her niche and that's where it's at.  almost all the tunes have that same techno beat which i don't care for.  i would like some variety...that's just me...but she will be a big winner with her target audience...GO lady!
Lady Gaga is 'family friendly' controversy ... so people can feel edgy while still feeding the pop megamachine ...I grabbed this for my kids and we got 8 songs (more than many) and they like a couple of songs so it was worth $1.  But on whole it is pop trash - her earlier stuff showed some spark but this is all safe and same-sounding.
This experience is horrible and is why people are stealing music instead of buying. It makes Lady Ga Ga look desperate too. Shame on you Amazon. I'll wait to go get it a local record store.
"Good album made great by the ""You and I"" song with sampling ""we will rock you"" and Brian May on the guitar.  Awesome awesome song."
Since her Fame days begun Lady Gaga has been building to something fantastic. Born This Way continues on her journey to become legend of Pop. Amazing Album.
She wants your money take it from me.  I got a copy and I got it for free.  GA GA GARBAGE....This cd only proves more to the world that she is all hype and no substance.  Her music is shallow over the top stupid and she's become the biggest media 'ho of the 21st century.  I can't find a single track to speak well of~!Free from Farmville I was disappointed with all the studio tricks thrown in....her vocals are like two cats f'ing her lyrics are that of a 12 year old school girl who just discovered a Thesaurus!  As for her videos and interviews....tone down the crazy....because that's how you appear.  And the crying jag about how money and fame are ruining your life and make you feel sad that you can't handle it all....isn't this what you wanted or is that just part of the media machine.Truly Madonna did it better the first time around....GA GA GARBAGE in pale comparison to the artists that she constantly steals material from....take a few years off and write something worth paying for....even the bootleggers can't give this crap away...and she has the balls for charge almost 170.00 for a deluxe package that doesn't even include a personal autograph!i get better songs and more respect for my money from other dance artists like Kristine W and Amber....at least they respond to you....GA GA GARBAGE says she's all about the fans....but we all know she's all about the fan's $$$$
Like sevral other reviewers only got part of the album. I got 5 tracks and the digital booklet.I've not had this happen before....what is up Amazon?Music is fine that I've heard. I will update this when I get full album.
I have not stopped listening to this album since it was released!  It is everything I had hoped for and more!  Lady Gaga never ceases to amaze me!
This CD is excellent and I'm very happy I purchased the Special Edition. The added tracks are fun. If you like Lady Gaga you're going to love this CD.
This is where I'd rate the album if it had downloaded successfully after I sent payment. Since amazon took my money and didn't provide me with the digital download for this purchase I'm rating it 1 star. Way to go amazon.
I absolutely love love Lady Gaga. I bought this a little after it was out. And EVERYONE SHOULD GET THE 22 SONG ONE. It's AMAZING. Lady Gaga is amazing &lt;3 All the songs make you want to move. Dance away ;D
This album is great and includes a lot of the favorites including two versions of &#34;Born This Way.&#34;  Just another one of Lady Gagas' successes!!!
 but a full album at one rime is a bit much for me.  Beat is too monotonous.  Does it come in a none dance version?
This is by far one of Gaga's best albums. Of course all of her songs are disco best songs (I dont care what you say this is disco) and not as offensive as some of her earlier works.
After 14 hours I finally received the album in my cloud player. Now I can finally review the album.Hardcore Gaga will love the album. Anyone who isn't that big of a Gaga fan will hate it. This album has a strange mix of modern pop music with an 80's pop/electronic feel. This is very noticeable in Bloody Mary and Marry The Night. After listening to this album a few times you will find it really does start to grow on you.
This review has NOTHING to do with the actual album its quality or the talent of fabulous Lady Gaga.Buyer beware! Even after reading all the negative reviews due to a flaw in the download process I went ahead and plunked my account info to Amazon.com to purchase this album.You know what they say out there: you get what you paid for and this time that saying came painfully true. The download process stalls from the very first track which in this case is the digital booklet and it does not budge. I have tried at least 10 times to download even ONE SONG and nothing happens I keep getting the same error message: Download Failed please try again later or contact customer service. I did just that and nada nothing zilch.I guess I will count my losses go to iTunes to download the album and pay more for it and vow never to purchase anything else from Amazon.com. There I said it.
I liked Lady Gaga's other music so I thought I would enjoy this album as well but it was not my cup of tea at all.
While there are some good songs on this album they don't quite take Lady Gaga to the next level as an artist. There are catchy hooks and interesting mixes but overall this feels awfully familiar.
There's a small skip on the second track but it's no big deal it's easy to miss. Otherwise great item and speedy shipping!
I just love this album!!! I think it is the best album I ever heard in my whole life!! I wasn`t a Gaga fan but now I certainly am!! I love this!! Goooooooddd work!!!! I finaly discovered Lady Gaga!! &lt;3&lt;3&lt;3 :X:X:X
Who ever said Gaga made good music is totally wrong! This album is just pure trash. Ever song is boring and really we all know she copied Britney Spears Femme Fatale album which a a brilliant album from Ms Spears. Gaga has copied the likes of Britney and Madonna in this album and to be honest all the songs sound the same and to me the songs are super boring and gaga this album is NOT the album of the Decade! If you want a good album then go and buy BRITNEY SPEARS: FEMME FATALE ALBUM.
I think Lady GaGa is the best female singer going. I have her CD's in my car and listen to them every time I am driving. Great voice great songs..
I am very sad to see that amazon didnt test the possible issues with offering this album for 99 cents before they made this promotion live.  I ordered 4 hours ago and got 4 songs immediately but have yet to get any others.  Thanks for the 99 cent album amazon but no thanks for not testing your servers first.  I guess I am going to pay in time what I wouldnt be paying in money.
Lady Gaga can do no wrong! I love this new album! I love how she's always changing things up. It's not just the same music over and over again. The only bad thing about this CD is that it's edited! I wish they would release an explicit version. Other than that though it's a winner! I would definitely recommend it!
"I don't usually write reviews but I had to try to balance out all of the people who gave album one star because of server problems. If there was a place to review amazon then I would suggest that you do that. However giving the album a poor rating because it would not download is very misleading.I am a recent convert to a Lady Gaga fan. The genre is not my favorite and I had several misconceptions about her as a performer and her character. However after being persuaded to take my young teen to her concert I was blown away! Of  all the concerts I have attended she was one of the best performers I have ever seen or heard.  She also impressed me with her message about being yourself and being strong.Yes I too was lucky enough to purchase this album for $.99.  The entire digital album downloaded for me without incident and at lightning fast speeds.  Honestly there are a 3 or 4 songs that will need to grow on me but other than those few songs I am blown away at the number of excellent songs on here!  I generally have a short attention span with music only listening to about 20-30 seconds of a song and only listening to 2 or 3 songs per album. This is one that I will be glad to put on and listen until the end. I may even have to put ""Born this Way"" on the repeat loop!Anyway I hope you are able to grab this baby up for $.99.  If you don't the album is still absolutely worth paying full price. There is not another full length album in this genre filled with as many great songs."
Born This Way is amazing but I think that the Fame Monster was better.... Everyone has different opinions so you have to check it out for yourself! It is a great lesson its one of the best albums this year.
The music is good...but Amazon isn't delivering what they promise!  BAD AMAZON!  I purchased this morning at 9AM by 3PM I still only have the same 4 songs I had 2 seconds after purchase.  Don't be deluded that you are purchasing the entire album for 99 cents...you will only get a couple songs...
"I have been an avid Gaga fan since 'Just Dance' and since then I have watched her grow as a musician and as a performer. Her last album The Fame Monster was by far one of the greatest works the world has ever experienced...my great-great-great grandkids are probably going to be blasting it some day. Many including myself wondered if anything could truly top TFM...the answer is yes...and the album is Born This Way. If you think Gaga is just singing about telephones and boys then this album will CERTAINLY prove you wrong. From the techno beats to the dark lyrics Gaga leaves us with a work that is made up of many different jewels. Each song is distinct and unlike anything that she has done before. Gaga is able to take her listens on a journey that is both whimsical yet so raw and genuine.INTERESTING FACT before my review: ALL of the album include the word 'love' in them :).Marry The Night: This song is about Gaga's realization that she'd never be an LA Hollywood sort of girl. Marry The Night represents giving yourself over to your passions regardless of what anyone may think. It's about believing in yourself and knowing that failure is not an option. Marry The Night is probably my favorite song on the album. I love it so much that I am planning on getting the first few lines tattooed on my inner left arm ""I'm gonna marry the night I won't give up on my life. I'm a warrior queen live passionately tonight."" I would love to see Gaga make this her next single release I believe it'd be the most commercially appealing. (10/10)Born This Way: Born This Way was Gaga's first release from the album. Although I do love the message of Born This Way love yourself and never compromise that for anyone it's probably my least favorite track on the album. Yes it is a very powerful song and many people do love it but for me it's just so easy to overlook in comparison to all of the other songs on the album. I do like the country version (which is on this album at the end) and the acapella version (at the end of the HBO special in the credits) better! (5/10)Government Hooker: This song fuses techno beats and electronica. It reminds me of something you'd hear in an Eastern European club or something! It's raw dirty and sexy all at the same time. Not to mention the chorus is incredibly catchy. My only wish is that it was uncensored to give it the full Hooker effect! (8/10)Judas: Quite easily one of the most popular songs on the album. Judas is so much more than just a song referring to religious figures it's about falling for the wrong guy again and again. I've LOVED Judas from the first moment I heard it which was on my iphone in a bathroom during my 15 minute work break btw lol. The beat is contagious as are the lyrics. I cannot wait to hear Gaga perform this at her next concert. (10/10)Americano: It took a while for this one to grow on me. It has a beautiful latin flare to it and once again that catchy chours is what drew me in. Gaga has explained that the song is about what the American Dream means to her. The lyrics to the song are truthful and symbolic. It reminds me of something you'd hear during an epic movie car chase in Mexico or something. (7/10)Hair: Aww...Hair has a special place in my heart because it reminds me of my jaded high school years. Growing up like many I struggled with trying to fit in and of course using my hair as a form of self expression. For some reason I always think of Glee when I hear it I'm sure they'll use it in their upcoming season. Although it is a very up beat song it does have a sadness to it. I think Gaga was definitely able to capture what it is like to be an outcast growing up and she does it through using hair as an incredible metaphor. (9/10)Scheibe:At first I loathed Scheibe with a holy passion. I felt like I needed to be at a German disco or something. However as time grew I realized that it couldn't go skipped. It's definitely a song that supports women's rights but it is able to get the message across with being too 'I am woman hear me roar!' which is great. I love playing this when I'm driving and working out! (9/10)Bloody Mary: Bloody Mary reminds me of a lullaby...it's sinister colorful and rather eerie. If it were a movie...it'd be a Tim Burton movie. It's very dark yet the lyrics are quite poetic if you take the time to listen to them. It's the favorite track of so many and although I don't really understand why...I respect it for what it is. But it's still not something I'd blast. (6/10)Black Jesus + Amen Fashion: Has an 80's high fashion runway feel to it which is precisely what I believe Gaga wanted. It's one of the most unique songs on the album. I also feel that it is a nod to the fashion world Gaga is a huge fashionista. (5/10)Bad Kids: This is another song that reminds me of my teenage years. It's loud sloppy and rebellious. It often seems to get overlooked by many Gaga fans maybe only bad kids like it : /. It's an incredible song. I probably find myself dancing and singing along to this the most out of any other tracks. I'd love to see this as a single as well just because the music video would kill! (10/10)Fashion of His Love: This was inspired by Gaga's dear friend fashion designer Alexander McQueen. It reminds me of New York high fashion and a day at the hair salon for some reason lol. It has an incredible upbeat tempo. I love that Gaga was able to turn such a tragedy into something that is not just filled with sorrow. It's a celebration of her and McQueen's friendship. (8/10)Highway Unicorn (Road to Love): I HATED Highway Unicorn the first 5 times or so that I heard it...then one day. It was like something clicked in my head. I remember turning it up one morning and singing along like I'd been possessed! I love everything about it...I can't even begin to describe it! It's just so different. (10/10)Heavy Metal Lover: Another favorite since day one. Heavy Metal Lover is sexual fun and enjoyable to grove to. Once again that eastern European techno influence makes its way onto the album. It makes for a great jukebox song to play at the bar or lounge. And no it doesn't have a trace of heavy metal in it. (10/10)Electric Chapel: This pairs very well with Heavy Metal Lover. Once again it has a great rock-trance like appeal. It's fun to grove too and I love that Gaga once again incorporates the phrase 'holy fool' which is prominent in Judas. In a lot of ways I feel like this is like...Judas part 2. (10/10)The Queen: Has a regal yet very modern appeal to it. It is another song about being confident in your abilities yet once again Gaga is able to get the message across without being campy. It's far from a favorite but I won't skip it when it's on. The last 3 minutes remind me of Gwen Stefani and Santana. (7/10)You And I: This is Gaga's most recent single. To be completely frank. I prefer the live version way more than the album version. The stomp clap kinda overshadows Gaga's piano and singing. However I love the guitar and the drums. This is just a good old fashion rock love ballad. We haven't had one of those in a while now so who can complain! And if you know the backstory behind You And I you'll appreciate it even more :) (8/10)The Edge of Glory: Gaga wrote this song for her grandfather who passed away. It's about the last few minutes one has on earth before their life concludes. I especially love that the song starts with a heart beat and ends with a flat line. It's an extra song because it was one of the last projects Clarence Clemons played on before his passing (he also plays in Hair). It has a has a heavy 80's early 90's feel to it. So many songs about death are slow and depressing but TEOG is really about celebrating the life that an individual has lived. It's an incredible song to hear her perform live on just a piano but do be prepared for tears if you decide to. TEOG was a perfect album conclusion. (9/10)."
straight up Ga Ga has musical chops she can play can sing and understands melody and Groove however alot of this album as with some of her other material at times comes off as Karoke style Madonna leftovers and feels contrived and when her imagery takes center stage you are stuck with a well skilled artist who is polished in the manipulation of selling a imagewhich leaves the music at hand cold and calculated.  she has real talenthowever the gimmicks at times tend override and if she keeps putting out half baked songs which just are rethreads of madonna and countless other acts then she will be done before she has a chance to truly shine. she got a chance to really be something as a artist if she works on real songs.
Just recently did I stop taking Lady Gaga as just another Madonna wannabe and actually listened to her music. This is great my favorite songs are Judas and Government Hooker.It does have a completely different sound then some of her last music but the quality is great and I can listen to it over and over AND its great for dancing!!
"I can't comment on the album as of yet I'll be listening to it shortly but I am going to comment on using Amazon for a digital purchase.  It stinks.  I'm only a nominal Lady Gaga fan but seeing her new album for $.99 seemed like a win-win so I figured I'd buy it.  The process of actually getting the album onto my computer was really simple (if it's Opposite Monday).  I'm pretty tech savvy and have had a PC since the mid 90's have upgraded systems with hardware software networks blah blah blah yet Amazon's way of doing things was still one of the more technologically frustrating episodes I've ever had.  They don't make it clear that you should download the mp3 downloader BEFORE you make your first purchase so I don't know if that was part of the problem or not but along the way I did see mention of it so I'm guessing that maybe that played into the level of absurdity at least a little bit.  Once downloaded it wouldn't launch.  After you download it it says something like ""Now so you can see how easy this works here's a free song for you to download.  You'll be able to see this wonderful app launch and the warm and good feelings you will have cannot be overstated.""  Okay I paraphrased maybe a little bit but anyway you click on the button to download the free song (and supposedly launch the downloader app) and instead of feeling the joy and glory of Amazon's technology you sit there like a moron as nothing happens.  Nothing.  Ever.  No matter how many times you re-try the process.  Nothing.  To be honest I don't remember all of the lousy stuff that happened during this process as I've since tried to block it out but I know that eventually I had to go through the whole installation process each time I downloaded something from my Amazon Cloud Player.  Before I figured that out though I do remember that I would click to download a song from the Cloud thing and the active x installer warning bar would show up at the top of my browser I'd click ""download the file"" and then the page would just reload with no downloading the file.  It lied.  I've left out some details and steps from the 45 minutes it took me to get from purchase point to actually having the songs on my computer but I can tell you this:  I won't make any more digital purchases from Amazon.  For a computer novice I can see the process of buying and downloading an album from Amazon being more agonizingly frustrating and confusing than figuring out The Da Vinci Code.  I hope the album was worth it because even at only $.99 for as much time and cursing it took to get the album onto my iPod $.99 might be $10 too much."
I have him(it) to listen to at first on another site.In brief to say everything to you I have him(it) to listen to the 1st time and some are very well spent but not the case of 10 others. Then by insisting (as for LOUD of Rihanna) I have to listen again and I can swear you that this album is a pure marvel. She(it) made progress it is of the good sound. The 1st was good but that there it is WHAO then made as me to listen to in buckle and to go to you to like him(it)!!!
I have to be honest..I am not a that big of a fan of lady gaga... But that being said.. I really like this album and how all her songs have a nice beat to them I can dance to it I can play this at a party or just jam to it in my car. the songs in this album are also different than her previous ones. it's a risk to do something different especially since her previous cd's were such major hits and were so abstract (which was the reason she was so popular in the first place) but I think it was a good different. She maintains her abstract self in this very catchy album
There are some nice songs on this album but over all I am not impressed with this artist.  It was free so I am not going to complain too much since I picked it up for that reason.
Gaga I changed my star rating for you realizing that I do love the album and it has nothing to do with the meltdown of Amazon's servers.  I came on to change my rating and I AM SORRY!  Government Hooker is my favorite...  Even @ $6.99 people...totally worth it  full price?? Still worth it.
I'm stoked that I can pick this up for a buck but I've been waiting for over an hour for three songs to become available to download to my computer from the cloud service. 5 stars to price and Gaga. 1 star to Amazon cloud
I understand that they're offering one of the biggest artists in the world right now for a dollar...but you mean to tell me that they didn't EXPECT one of their biggest days ever when they inked this deal? I've been trying to download this since 10am EST...I'm 4 songs in...deleted the downloader loaded it again and purchased it AGAIN... and still nothing... sure I'll be patient...but they really should have beefed up their network for such a big day...
Nice CD... She's awesome... Perfect voice... I like Born this way you and I... Edge of glory... Judas... All CD
worst album ever. I only paid $1 for this thing and I still feel ripped off. Don't waste your money.
this album is the best one yet. queen monster has out done herself yet again. this is full of inspirational lyrics and fun dance beats. its the complete package. every little monster should purchase this album if you are a true gaga fan. it will not disappoint!
love Lady Gaga and got this for a great deal a long time ago on Amazon. This is a great fun cd
It is 5:40pm EST and I just downloaded the whole album in less than 2 minutes.  I heard about the promo earlier in the day but waited because I expected a mad rush in the AM.  Whatever problems Amazon had earlier in the day are obviously resolved.
Very unhappy the day Amazon let this go for 99 cents.  My computer crashed and froze and eventually loaded a virus with this that desroyed my computer.  McAfee didn't even catch it.  To bad I like the album just don't have it now because the computer had to be completely wiped out and reloaded.  The 99 cent album cost me over $200 in repairs.  So not cool!  Will never download from Amazon again.
Does this deal look too good to be true? That's because it is. Several people have had trouble downloading the full album. I am one of them. I paid my 99 cents and got one song and the digital booklet. Oh Well. This is what happens when you have too many things going on at once.
"For some reason I keep worrying Gaga is going to run out of ideas or just not be able to keep up this intense level of awesomeness she's been at since the beginning. But those worries got completely obliterated when I listened to this album. ""Born This Way"" is like the ultimate album for 1989. The one I always wanted to hear but never did because cultural aesthetics changed before it was possible to make it... if I had heard this any time from 1986 to 1992 I think my brain would have exploded from enthusiasm.I'm not going to get into details but I think ""Bloody Mary"" is my new favorite Lady Gaga song. It's also her gothest song yet and I think it would be awesome if she got some goth/industrial bands to remix it (please Gaga?)"
I love this album. it has great dance beats and song that have points of view (immigration female empowerment self acceptance).It's a good move in the right direction. I think she's got some very epic songs to choose for her 9 singles!!
Definitely the best record of the decade. Lady Gaga continues to amaze me as she continues to grow as a musical artist. I love seeing the continual evolution of her music and her image. Can't wait to see whats next but for now BTW is the best album out there.
THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM I HAVE EVER OWNED/HEARD.! LADY GAGA IS BACK AGAIN WITH ONCE AGAIN A NUMBER 1 HIT ALBUM.! ALL THE SONGS ARE GREAT WITH AWESOME POWER BEATS AND GREAT MESSAGES IN ALL THE MESSAGES.! I'M GLAD LADY GAGA WAS BORN THIS WAY.! SHE BROUGHT MUSIC TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL WITH GREAT MUSIC.! ANYONE WHO HASN'T LISTENED TO THIS CD NEEDS TO LISTEN TO IT.!
Lady Gaga proved her talent on this album her vocal ranges her talent in writing and her piano skills on You & I. Not to mention she got some of the top musicians to play on this record. And how she managed to touch so many monsters and free us.
This lady is not doing anything that has not already been done. Her music is a new version of disco from the 70's.
What else needs to be said? The music is amazing; her message is wonderful. Thinking of buying this? Just do it you won't regret it. Even the DJ mixes on the second disk are pretty cool. One features Marilyn Manson.GREAT CD.
Lady Gaga...The woman who became the most famous artist in the world in 3 years. The woman who shocked people with her music fashion dance and stage persona. Born This Way is an example for that. Comparing to The Fame it is much more darker edgier and real...Marry The Night 8/10: A fine dance song. Great for intro...Born This Way 9/10: Sorry haters but this track is an anthem even without It's lyrics. With It's message Born This Ways deserves the attention.Government Hooker 8/10: Government Hooker is a haunting dance track with in-your-face lyrics and Madonna inspired melody.Judas 9/10: The most mainstream track on the cd. I might call it Bad Romance part 2. But somehow I find this track more addictive.Americano 10/10: It's fun hot sexy and probably the most listened track on my I-pod this summer.Hair 10/10: Great lyrics with 80s brat pack style melody. A combo!Scheisse 10000/10: OH MY GOD. MY FAVOR'TE FAVOR'TE FAVOR'TE track on the cd. Catchy and dark. I mean Gaga even made german sexy :DBloody Mary 9/10: It's pop and Gaga sings the hell of it.Black Jesus/Amen Fashion 8/10: A solid dance track. Not my favorite not my least favorite.Bad Kids 7/10: Love It but this doesn't stand on it's own. Really love the beginning though.Fashion Of Love 9/10: Just 2 words. LOVE IT.Highway Unicorn 8/10: Love the title love chorus.Heavy Metal Lover 4/10: I just hate this track. It's a mess and it doesn't show any singing abilities of Gaga.Electric Chapel 9/10: Addictive.The Queen 8/10: 80s power track with relative lyrics.You And I 10/10: The live version would ultimately be my favorite. But this a masterpiece on It's own too.Edge Of Glory 10/10: 90s dance track that made me love Gaga once again. Solid closure.
"The review section is for reviews OF THE PRODUCT not the delivery mechanism. If you want to complain about how Amazon ""screwed you"" on your $1 for a very mediocre album there is a complaint department for that (and numerous other avenues for you to cry about the hiccup that Amazon had in delivering your precious Lady Gaga album).OK all that nonsense aside lets look at this slab of flat pop. As bad as the title song is Madonna homage that it is there's not much else to recommend here. The production is very good the best Gaga-money can buy. But her warped pseudo-religious lyrics get in the way every time. they make no sense even on the scale of Lady Gaga songs. There's probably about a dollar's worth of value in the album so if you didn't get in on the sale pick the one track that actually sounds good and buy that."
I rarely listen to anything pop or rock. Aside from Elton John Queen Jewel and the fabulous voice of Lady Gaga. She is a fascinating character and her voice reminds me of a mix between Freddy Mercury and Elton John.It's the tracks that are less well known that I like the most. 'Americano' and 'You And I' and 'Hair' are just three of my favourites.I can watch some of her interviews over and over on Youtube because she is hilarious a real character. Her voice stripped down to just piano is absolutely beautiful. She recently performed 'You And I' live on UK TV and it was magical.This album is not perfect there is a lot of overly heavy background music and I hope that she will produce an album of ballads one day?The fact is she is one of the most inventive characters to grace the music industry AND she is a genuinely talented musician and vocalist too.
This review is regarding Amazon's downloading service not Lady Gaga's album which I haven't had the opportunity to listen to yet.  I made multiple attempts to purchase the MP3 version of the album when it was listed for $.99.  Amazon ended up charging my credit card for two separate purchases but the album did not download either time.  I purchased the album a third time on 26 May 2011 when they ran it for $.99 again.  The site forced me to download the album to the cloud drive which I did not want.  I was eventually able to download the songs from the cloud drive to my hard drive but had to do it one song at a time.  $2.97 for an album is still a good price but having to purchase the album 3 separate times before actually receiving it without being offered any compensation is unacceptable.  In the future I will use itunes or buy the CD.
"I really don't know what to say here. I'm a fan of LG's previous attempts and nearly all of her songs on her past albums have made the rotation on my playlists.How anyone can listen to this entire album and give it more than 1 or 2 stars is beyond me. If you're a fan of doing nothing but clubbing or hitting a Rave well...maybe you'll enjoy this album.There is NO CREATIVITY in this album in fact...after 3 complete listens all the way through I'm removing this album from my playlist. There is only 1 song (very disappointed by this as I said) that I'm going to keep in rotation. That song is YOU AND I and I did enjoy it as it seemed to have some creativity and a thought out composition.As for everything else on this album...take 3 or 4 dance beats 2 or 3 ""sounds""...a ton of digital alteration/autotune effects MIX it all together and you'll have every repetitive song on this album summed up.Ugh I honestly hope people are listening through this album multiple times then writing reviews. DO NOT WRITE A REVIEW ASSUMING THIS IS THE CREATIVE CRAZY AND FUN GAGA YOU HAVE LISTENED TO.Not even close it sounds like 3 guys got together in a studio told LG to sing some songs then they threw a bunch of dance beats and random CRAP mixes together and told her thank you for the lyrics she added to their generic dance album. LG needs to fire the people that headed this one."
I love this CD.  Some songs are fun while others bear a message of acceptance - all are well written.  They are all carried high by Gaga's pure vocals and musicality.  Looking forward to Gaga's long and stellar career.
Born This Way Lady Gaga's newest album does not fail to live up to expectations. Unlike either her premier or sophomore albums The Fame and The Fame Monster it brings a heavy dance beat to her talented vocals in tracks that give her a completely new sound. Although no remixes are necessary for songs like 'Heavy Metal Lover' and 'ScheiBe' to go to the clubs the special edition includes some of the best that will have you fist pumping no matter where you are. With an all-star line up of collaborations with large names like Clarence Clemons and Brian May Lady Gaga leaves no doubt that we can expect more great things from her in the future.
I'll be patient for the entire album to be available in the cloud I can imagine that Amazon is experiencing a much higher volume of orders/downloads than normal today. I have the digital booklet and 1 song so far I ordered approx 2 hours ago.
If I could give this -10 stars I would.What do we have here? The same old generic beats same old same old.In the hard rock/heavy metal world most people still listen to and talk about Black Sabbath's debut album in reverential tones. It was released FORTY ONE YEARS AGO. Why do we talk about it? Because it was an honest uncompromising work of unparalleled power and originality. It stands as a relevant moment in music history.The same goes for the jazz masters. The body of work left behind by Ellington Monk Coltrane Jaco and Miles (to name but a few) is as fresh and relevant today as when they were active.Can the same be said of this repetitive derivative pile of bubblegum? Hardly.The clock is ticking Ms. Germanotta. Your 15 minutes are almost up. You WILL fade away soon.
after releasing 3 singles before the cd drops you think this is the best. Hell NO....there is so much more. I love gaga and i love this cd. She pulls out all the stops. If your a fan your gonna love it if your a hater than thats what you are case closed. Its all about music  fun dance...its not gonna take care of the worlds problems but is any music gonna No so lets dance till the world ends could you think of a better way to end it????? thought not. thanks gaga love it. you rock my world till the end.
Well it happened before and it'll happen again I guess. The album wasn't even a dollar. However every place that sells this album in America needs to make damn sure we know that it is fully censored. You don't get to hear the songs in the way that they were intended. Once again we were duped by a record label who doesn't care about freedom of speech as much as Gaga or any of us do. DO NOT BUY if you wanted to hear the songs in the right way. Instead wait and get the uncensored version if it's ever released(probably won't be). However I believe the Australian version of the Album is uncensored like The Fame Monster.Buy the Australian version. I'm going to give Amazon a call to make sure they have that in the information.
Lady Gaga's second or third outing (depending on how you're counting) is very much a different outing than her first two releases which seems to have caused no end of angst that this wasn't The Fame Part III. Given how many middling songs I felt were used as filler on the Fame (virtually all the non-singles) this wasn't a bad move. Overall she tries her hand at a wider array of genres and pulls most of them off fairly well. The diversity of musical styles left me scratching my head at a lot of the criticism that all the songs sounded the same on this album which is almost impossible to believe. Songs like Bloody Mary and Hair sound the same? Really? I will say that nearly all of the songs were meant to be danced to and have club-style beats to match it. If you love long slow piano-driven songs this album is not for you. She promised a very danceable album and delivered. I love 80's-style songs too sax solos and all. Sue me.As much as I have enjoyed the singles released thus far especially Judas the high points for me involve (as yet) non-singles:Marry the Night is a great album opener.Schei&szlig;e is absolutely a hoot and is probably the funnest song on the album especially as she's apparently convinced a not insignificant number of people that she can speak German when the song itself tells you quite plainly that she can't.Bloody Mary is brooding and excellent.Heavy Metal Lover is a song I dismissed as uninteresting at first but grew on me immensely to the point it's almost my favorite - smooth and methodical with an excellent bridge.The only song that truly faceplants on the album I feel is Yo&uuml; And I. No one has managed to get me to enjoy pop country ballads and that includes Lady Gaga (Speechless made me similarly cringe). Americano also is a bit all over the map but still is fun to listen to.5 Stars if only to counteract the complaints about Amazon's service which don't belong here.
"Before this album I've only heard a few Gaga songs thanks to Rock Band and Glee but after hearing this album I'm going to buy and try more of her music. ""Born This Way"" and ""Government Hooker"" are what I've been replaying more than other songs. Over all great album."
THANK YOU for the .99 album on day of release! Even though I will go out and get the extended album tomorrow as well its so great to have it the night before!As far as the album is concerned I am listening and wondering how does she top this?  She combines the best styles of the 70s with the synth magic of the 80s that we all fondly adore and the hard driving edgy techno from the 90s (think the firece DJ remixes by people like Barry Harris and Thunderpuss Victor Calderone Peter Rauhoffer Hex Hector).Thank you Gaga for burying your competition maybe they will learn to keep up!!
what can I say pure entertainnment keeps me moving & motivated.  Enjoy listening when have lots to do and meed to keep up the pace
Gaga impressed me with poker face  then bad romance telephone  and paparazzi!  Paparazzis is by dar the Best gaga release!However this album is like a dejavu. Something I have seen before. She is not innovating and he put way too much effort in trying to send good messages in the lyrics. The result= the songs don't sound good. The only decent song is I was born this way but this album is full of fillers and does not add anything to pop music.
I bought this for 99 cents and I'm glad I didn't pay a penny more.This is a rehash of just about every dancey techno-pop song I heard in the 80s and 90s. Lady Gaga might seem original and genius to people who weren't around back then but take it from an old Gen X'er she's not.
This album is pure awesomeness...Such a variety of songs each special in its own way. A must have album! Get it as soon as possible!!
Either Cloudplayer is buggy for this download or is just unstable and pointless. I had to send an email to customer Service to get help downloading. And they'll get back to me within 12 hours?!? Its a download service and you can't get back to me any sooner than twelve hours?Generally a huge fan of Amazon but the Cloud Player has been nothing but a pain in the a@@.  Too bad this has to go under Lady Gaga Album but I have no idea what half of it sounds like so maybe I'll give it three stars and the Cloud Player and big fat raspberry.
This cd is great. I project a few songs won't make the radio seen like Hair and Americano but the other songs are great.  It's a must have. Her voice is good the music is better and her message is clear. She was born to stay a born winner!!!
This album is a masterpiece.  The only problem with this album is that it was hyped to death.  If this album just came along it would blow everybody away.  There is not an album out right now better than this one.  And I can honestly say it is the best album I've heard in years.  This is not just a superficial pop album.  It is a great work of art and you can tell it was a labor of love.  A lot of hard work went into this and it shows.  It reminds me of Michael Jackson's albums in that the production is so prestine and perfect.  Standout tracks: Bloody Mary Electric Chapel Shiebe Black Jesus Edge of Glory.
Honestly I expected way more than what I received. Even though I'm aware of all shipping process and badly managing that it is handled with the collector box looked nothing quiet as the image of the adverting available item. The box was barely a square shaped looking box all damaged. I've been told that +2 packaged items comes in bigger and safer shipping boxes which assures it's quality yet I think you should be a little more careful with one item packages since they are easily broken or ruined. Just for you to be aware of how you're making your customers receive the products you're selling. As a person who usually buys from many websites you cannot (or at least should not) leave all the shipment process up to somebody else's hands. Not returning it though because it's an useless thing to do.
"Well with ARTPOP less than a month away I figure it's time to review Lady Gaga's third and at the time of writing this most recent album Born This Way. I have a lot to say about this album before I do my usual run-down of each individual song so I hope you'll pardon the wall-of-text. First of all if any of you followed Gaga for quite some time now you'd know that this album had an insane amount of hype built up for it. Gaga started talking about this album as early as March of '10. For those keeping score that's before Alejandro even released as a single. From then on out she teased songs from the album several times in the coming months. Because she wanted to finish her Monster Ball Tour before releasing the album itself she ended up releasing three singles to further build up hype.When the album finally came out it was during a somewhat low point in my life and I hadn't listened to any Gaga in nearly a year so hearing these new songs really cheered me up. I listened to the radio a lot back then and my local pop station was playing tons of Gaga in celebration of this new album which sort of re-kindled the crush I'd had on her years earlier. So did it live up to all the hype? Let's take a look at each song and find out.Marry the Night: Though this was the first song on the album it was actually the fifth and final single. It's a song about not letting life get you down and instead seizing the day(or marrying the night?) and living life to its fullest. It sounds phenomenal and quickly became one of my favorite songs on the album. The music video isn't half-bad either!Born This Way: This is the one that everyone has heard regardless of whether they're a Gaga fan or not. It's the title track as well as the lead single a first for Lady Gaga. You could argue that Katy Perry Ke$ha and Pink all sent a similar message with ""Firework"" ""We R Who We R"" and ""Raise Your Glass"" respectively but I think Gaga pulled off the ""self-respect anthem"" the best. She's been a proud LGBT rights activist ever since The Fame and this song served to solidify that even further. It's incredibly catchy and I think even someone who doesn't care for Gaga might enjoy this track.Government Hooker: You know I'm honestly not sure what message this song was trying to send but it could perhaps be well how corrupt the government is? It's a generally fast song that goes back and forth from sounding happy and bouncy to dark and serious. The chorus is particularly driving and I consider it the best part. This isn't one of my favorites on the album but I still like to listen to it.Judas: For all the praise I've given Lady Gaga up until now this is where I must give criticism instead. You can say that I have no taste you can say that I'm not a ""true fan"" or anything else you want to say but this is my unbiased opinion. Judas is the worst song on this album. Not only that it's Lady Gaga's worst song overall. Considering how solid the rest of this album is I truly don't know what went wrong here. This song sounds and feels like something that was originally supposed to be given to Britney Spears or some other generic pop artist but was passed off to Gaga at the last minute. It isn't very catchy and the overload of religious references in the lyrics make it very uncomfortable to listen to. I generally don't like the way it sounds and the music video is rather lackluster to boot. Why she chose this as her second single is beyond my comprehension. I seem to be alone in my opinion of this song as I've heard many fans call it their favorite or at least one of them(sometimes the same people who will shun songs such as Brown Eyes or I Like It Rough). Thankfully this is where my negative thoughts toward this album end.Americano: Another one of the best songs on the album. Gaga really shows off her vocal range and prowess here and the acoustics in the instrumental complement it well. It's another political commentary-ish song but makes itself a lot more apparent than Government Hooker did.Hair: This promotional single is another fantastic one! Lyrically It's undeniably happy and uplifting and the instrumental is one of the best on the album. Many fans consider this a very relatable song.Scheisse: (I don't have German characters on my keyboard) I literally can't get enough of this song. It's my second-favorite from this album and it's an upbeat powerful feminist anthem that even a dude like me can appreciate. Parts of the song are sung in fake-German as an analogy to how many people hear feminists as speaking gibberish.Bloody Mary: I know I'll sound a bit contradicting when I say I love this song after I just ranted on Judas but this one doesn't shove the religious reference in your face as much as that song did and it sounds loads better! It's a bit slower paced than the other songs but catchy nonetheless. It has a very creepy ethereal vibe to it and the scream after the chorus really catches you off-guard the first time.Bad Kids: A happier-sounding song than the last two this one's sort of an anthem for all the would-be revolutionaries of this generation. I enjoyed this one quite a bit as well as it stands out quite well from the rest of the album.Highway Unicorn (Road to Love): The first romantically-themed song on the album and yet another one of my favorites. To me this song always had some Cher vibes to it which is never a bad thing. It has a very happy positive feel to it that should be able to lift anyone up.Heavy Metal Lover: With prominent elements of techno and rock in the instrumental this song kinda takes you by surprise. It's another love song with some interesting double entendres in the lyrics. Incredibly driving and danceable.Electric Chapel: This song sports some more evident electric guitar than the last song and features a very ""pulsating"" beat that goes well with the romantic lyrics. It seems like she put all the love songs on this album right next to each other and it really adds nice pacing to the whole thing.You and I: By far this is my favorite song on the album. Harkening back to ""Brown Eyes"" ""Again Again"" ""Speechless"" and the feel of her older music in general this lovely rock-piano ballad is not to be overlooked. It's a staple of hers to have at least one of these on every album and I'm glad she finally decided to release one as a single(the fourth for this album to be precise). It features a well-used sample of Queen's ""We Will Rock You"" and the song has a sweet endearing feeling to it. This is something I'd suggest to anyone who tries to say Lady Gaga can't sing.The Edge of Glory: The last song on the album as well as the second single. This one is about living out the last night of your life with a nice romantic touch to it. This was one of my favorite songs throughout most of 2011 and rightfully so. It has some deep meaning to it yet still manages to be catchy and dance-worthy. The music video for this song is easily the best out of the five and she looks positively beautiful in it. The saxophone in the instrumental sounds great as well!Born This Way (Jost & Naaf Remix): The sole bonus track on the standard edition. It's a very dance-oriented remix to the title track that somehow manages to be even catchier than the original. A nice extra addition!Final thoughts - This is the album that Lady Gaga wanted to be her best and most if not all of her fanbase generally agrees. While I don't think it quite outdid The Fame (Which is my favorite pop album overall) I still consider it a fantastic record. There was a lot of controversy over Amazon initially selling this record for 99 cents each but I think it can be overlooked considering that it sold rather well even without those figures. I'll give this record five stars because I don't think one bad song is enough to bring it down though it's still her only song so far that I outright disliked. I actually did see Lady Gaga live at the Born This Way ball at the start of this year where I was treated to live versions of all these songs as well as her older songs and it was an absolute music lover's dream! In summary if you enjoyed Gaga's previous work this is definitely something to pick up!"
This was my first foray into Lady Gaga. After hearing some songs on the radio I decided to give it a shot since it was a daily deal on amazon. It's ok I'm just glad I didn't pay full price for it.
When Lady Gaga first appeared I honestly didn't get the appeal. She took off so fast here in Australia but when I listened to her first album I will admit - I wasn't all that impressed. I started changing my tune when Alejandro came out and by the time Born This Way was being released I was just as eager for this album as most of her fans. Before I write my thoughts I will say that I'm curious about how the opinions of those who reviewed this album when it first came out might be different today some months on. I say this because my opinion of this album has definitely changed since I first heard it back in May when I probably would have given it 3 stars.I was less than impressed after my first listen with only a few songs having caught my attention. And now? every single song on the album is quite simply put a joy to listen to. It takes quite a few listens to really pick up on everything most importantly being the heart-felt intelligent and meaningful lyrics. I grew up on pop music from other female artists like Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera and while their music excelled at catchy tunes the meaning behind the songs was often quite shallow. And that doesn't fall back on those artists simply because it was others writing their music for them. It wasn't them baring their souls for all to see. That's what we have here with Lady Gaga who does contribute to her songs - she is baring her soul who she is and giving us someone real to connect with. And she does it well.While I said I love and listen to all the tracks I do have my favourites of course being Heavy Metal Lover Bloody Mary Scheibe Hair and Marry The Night. I would really urge people to take their time with the album not just take it at first listen or prejudge based on any assumptions you have about her as a person or artist. There is a deeper message beneath all of it and I think Lady Gaga is an amazing inspiration with her acceptance and tolerance of diversity - there needs to be more of this in the world. I've heard her older fans express disappointment in that this album sounds different to her earlier ones but I think it's important to realize that artists are typically put in shackles when it comes to their music and image and Lady Gaga seems to have been able to break away from all that and speak/sing freely of things that are important to her. It's all a matter of taste of course but people thinking about buying this album shouldn't expect it to be the same Lady Gaga sound as before and to judge it (or her) before even listening means potentially missing a very special experience.
Meaningful fun different and energetic new album from Gaga.  I can recommend it to whomever is interested in contemporary pop music.
This album is edgy but not outstanding; catchy but not trend-setting; special but not the best.I love several songs on here especially Electric Chapels and Hard Metal Lover because they reminiscent Britney's Blackout materials. I also enjoy Edge of Glory and Judas despite sounding like other songs but at least they are radio friendly and catchy.ScheiBe Government Hooker Bloody Mary Marry The Night is really edgy and special but looks like the production is trying so hard to give them special touches the whole things are just messy and the lyrics is even under Katy Perry writing levels.The rest are just flat. I especially hate You and I. If Gaga were to write this for somebody else to sing it would be better her vocals is very spiky and annoying.One last thing while this album is in my opinion on par with Rihanna's Hard and Ke$ha's Cannibal the promotion and selling campaign is ridiculous and desperate. I mean selling at McDonalds and paying Best Buy and Amazon to sell it for $0.99 you are a world-class and very talented artist you can do better and higher than that. I guess now she is just desperate for record-breaking numbers when the quality is going down day by day. Disappointing!
This is the first time I purchased a Lady Gaga CD. I only know her from press and video clips.I had a negative feeling for her due to her too much self-exposure and very eccentric personality.I am really happy I bought this combo set and watched the Monster Ball Tour.She is quite gifted talented and really a great performer.They way she sings dances and plays in the piano is very exciting.Yes she is very provocative but I grew up with listening and watching David Bowie Madonna Cher Michael Jackson and Queen. You can notice those superstar's influences easily. Still she made her own music in an impressive way.After all this a a great set to have in my personal collection and really worth buying it.I recommend to first time Lady gaga listeners as well.
I may be biased writing this review mainly cause Lady Gaga is my absolute favourite artist. But objectively speaking this album was fabulous! I was waiting for Born This Way for quite a while and did not disappoint! When I first collectively listened through the entire album it was different I couldn't tell if it was in a good or bad way. However after a few listens it occurred to me that this was just a different side of Gaga. The Fame Monster (my favourite album although it was an EP) was more of a dark and twisty edge to it. Born This Way at least to me is more of a celebration of who she is shown especially in Edge of Glory. To people who believe that these songs are commercial and that Gaga has lost what originally brought her stardom--you're wrong!! Who else but Gaga could have a saxophone interlude in her songs and still have it play on the radio. On behalf of all your fans thank you Gaga for the happiness you have brought to our ears!
After the disappointment of the Born This Way and Judas singles I must admit I was worried about how this album was going to turn out. Had Gaga lost her magic?I'm delighted to say that those two tracks are the weakest songs on the album and every other track is 5* classic pop.Memorable choruses pristine production values and so many magical moments I had to listen to the whole album twice just to really start to process how great this album really is.It would be unfair to pick out highlights because there arejust so many I only skipped Born This Way and Judas (sorry but I just don't think I can ever like these two).True Gaga fans need to buy the deluxe version as the 3 extra tracks you get are absolutely awesome and should really be on the regular version too. Black Jesus alone is worth the price of an upgrade.This is one relieved Gaga fan can't wait to see these songs being played live on the next tour.Is this the album of the decade? I thought following up The Fame was a tall order but she pulled it off. Go gaga go!
"Compare to The Fame and The Fame Monster ""Born This Way"" Is a heavy Duty with lots of Rock element in every songs. Personally I think GaGa just move to another level with this album. I'm sure people gonna be shocked because it's kinda new for Pop Mainstream music specially with pure Pop music fans. As for me I love this album because it's very hard tough deep and wild. From head to toe GaGa shocks people with Marry the Night with a surprising ending. Government Hooker Americano Bloody Mary Sheisse Hair You n I Heavy Metal Lover are all my favorite. with Edge of Glory she ends the album with a happy ending it's very emotional and happy I feel like she's holding my hands and claim to a mountain which named ""Glory"". LOVE THIS ALBUM!"
Born This Way album is amazing!!I love all the songs! it makes me feel so good and happy!!!!Gaga is my queen!!!!Love her so much!- Neta-lee
I just talked to Amazon.  The lady I spoke with was rude and it was almost like i was inconveniencing her for calling due to her company's product not working.  She said they are aware of an issue and to try and re-download it again in a few hours.  Then basically hung up on me and said thank you for shopping with Amazon.  Definitely no longer buying from Amazon.  ITunes from here on out for me.  Worst.  Experience.  Ever.
"Lots of people spend so much time describing what the lyrics of each song mean to them but don't really tell anything about the quality of the music and how the songs sound - this is a music album after all not a book!The truth is Lady Gaga makes OK sounding music. Nothing great.... And then she relies on the people to like and connect to her lyrics and uses her weird image and the media to make bada-bing red carpet news and get some hype about an upcoming album or a concert tour... (These tactics are so obvious and well known to anyone who is inside the music business)This album fails to deliver in the ""sound"" category in my opinion... Almost all songs sound like Swedish pop music from the beginning of the nineties. As a matter of fact when I first heard some of the songs I thought she must have collaborated with Ace Of Base or a member of ABBA... It sounds just like them... at moments it is so cheesy it drives me nuts... I didn't really enjoy most of the songs in the album at all. Her music is nothing special really that's why she only gets nominated (you usually get nominated when you do a lot of sales) for awards but rarely wins any. But most importantly her music is ""Listen"" only type. And it gets boring fast. The radio stations don't even play any of the songs in this album any more if they do they play Gaga songs they play her best 2 songs - ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face""... And you'll never hear a Gaga song in the clubs... (Just Dance may be).I am not saying that every album should be made for the clubs but if you want to be a Pop star you better make 2-3 ""Dancing"" songs or may be invite a rapper as a featuring...to make it more interesting. She wants to be the new diva queen of pop but her music is not popular everywhere really and that's what pop really means. Or she could of made a couple of songs with one of the top European ""House"" DJs (David Guetta for example) like Kanye did with Daft Punk. Or she could have done something new that no one has done before or something that rarely gets done - like mixing it up with reggae or Latin or something else... She started this Swedish pop sounding thing with ""Alejandro"" from her previous album and I thought Well - OK - one or two songs that sound like this is fine but then she released ""Born This Way"" and most of the songs sound like this... for me this is very disappointing!I hope she comes up with something better next time!"
I bought one song the title track and I like it. What more can I say but She is a great singer?
It was nerve racking enough when I heard she worked with Madonna...now to actually listen to it is sad. Her first album was fantastic...this album not so much. Out of the 21 songs I only like 4 or 5 of them...and that's because they stick with her old style. This album makes me think of her as a Madonna wannabe which is sad because she was so unique and out there. This album makes me think of a horrible Christian band gone totally wrong..there's a lot of Jesus in her music not that there is anything wrong with that but I don't think it goes with the whole Gaga thing...if this is the future of Gaga leave me out of it.
Seller was great and shipped fast.  great must have for any GAGA fan.  Bought this for my father who is a huge fan of hers for Xmas and he loved it!!!!!!!
"This chick has no talent whatsoever. Her music sounds electronic rather than having actual instruments going with it. It's all just computerized and boo-boo gaga! Every song has her screaming... do you think people want that? Uh... no! We actually desire nice music having some pop soft jazz or even a little twang. But n-no... Lady BooBoo-Gaga wants to be all creative and artsy which made her really look bad. That one video ""Judas"" made no sense at all and I had to figure it all out too long. ""Born This Way"" makes Lady Gaga dishonest because she wasn't born with clothes on just a birthday suit. Also Lady Gaga could lose her voice so technically she was only born with a heart brain and bones. Should we follow Ms. Gaga on Twitter and be her friend or should we start disliking her 'way-too-creative-side' for once? For me the radio isn't streaming good music anymore which disappoints me deeply. All I hear is ""We wanna make the world dance forget about the price tag!""... who cares our economy is showing that already dumb-dumbs?"
Giving the album the boost it needs for ratings after seeing bad reviews given for other reasons not even pertaining to the artist's work.
This was a gift for a teenager and yes it was well received. the package had everything including an album all with gaga's signature on it. thanks for making it easy to choose gifts for teenagers
&#34;Born This Way&#34; didn't live up to my expectation. I loved &#34;Fame&#34; and subsequently &#34;Fame Monster&#34;. There are some great songs but I was hoping for it to be more edgy than this. Still some very catchy songs to dance and sing to.
Not a bad cd. has a few good songs. Would say its only worth the .99 cents I paid for it though.
BORN THIS WAY IS NOT JUST AN ALBUM ITS A WAY OF LIFE. LADY GAGA IS A GENIUS WHO HAS CREATED THE GREATEST SONGS OF ALL TIME AND THEY ARE ALL ON THIS ALBUM!!!!!!
Lady Gaga everything you do every decision you make is simply brilliant. Thanks for making great music and for being such a savvy business woman. Your fans love your style.
This will most definitely be the best album of 2011 and her best album yet. Many of the songs from the album are all extremely original and resemble heavy metal rock songs with sledge-hammering dance beats. Not one song is boring. The vocals are fantastic and powerful while singing lyrics with so much meaning to society. Lady Gaga has really put herself out there and put a lot of effort into making such a great album.
This is a great product and I would purchase from this seller again in the furture. I'm pleased with the delivery and shipment of the product. I've also recommended this seller to my Family and Friends. Thank You!Twenty Words:It's the season of Mom and Dad! Celebrate the good things that being a parent brings. make this year special with heartfelt gestures and great gifts that give back.
I only got one song and the booklet which I didn't want anyways. False marketing!!!! I want the rest of the songs.
I was ready to love this album but it only took listening through one time to realize that this album is a bust.  She's trying too hard... saying the syllable of a word over and over again for every song gets redundant boring and expected. A-A-A-A-America Gaga-a-a-a-a Juda-a-a-a-a La La La La La blahhhh blahhhh.  I do like the Edge of Glory so that $.99 was worth paying for that one song.  Beware- the album is not worth paying full price!!!
I like this CD and is probably one of the best CDs she has put out. I am not a fan of her new stuff.
ah lady gaga  the singer that makes you wonder is she from another planet or from our drunken nightmares ?her second album is a gem of OVERUSED  recycled beats..theres nothing original here folks.. its a wonder why people would go nuts over tripe like this..shes nothing more than a madonna wannebee..
I had 7 right away then a few minutes later I refreshed and had 9 but I'm still missing 5 of the songs they are grayed out at the moment.  At least let me enjoy my impulse buy immediately!
I was worried that this album wouldn't be so great but that is because the media tricked me. Gaga comes to terms with religion in a modern world all through the album. While it is drenched in 80s and 90s madness it still manages to push ahead as a pop album that shamelessly commands you to dance the entire way through. Adele can sing to a harp with God while Gaga takes on heavy metal in the lowest depths of hell. She sings her ASS off. And the hooks will haunt your dreams.
"Before the release of this album I constantly said that when it was released I was going to be EXTREMELY strict on it since I have always been sceptic about Lady Gaga's ways on this business (the way she is the way she dresses and the songs she makes). Well after listening ""Born this way"" several times already I now stand corrected.This is a great pop album. From beginning to end Gaga doesn't stop enjoying herself on her songs and the whole production that OBVIOUSLY she put behind them. I understand harcore fans when they're saying that the album is kind of dissapointed because this is not a DANCE album as ""The fame monster"" (2009) was. This is more like a pop record with plenty of beats here there and everywhere but not quite to play on a party for instance but they shouldn't worry about that at all. I'm sure there are plenty of remixes to come for these songs for them to enjoy. I must say that ""Born this way"" has a huge Madonna's influence from her music back in the 90's and a bit of the 80's (you must know this by now with the ""BTW"" single). Personally I love songs like ""Marry the night"" ""Born this way"" ""Government hooker"" and ""Scheibe"" (great great beat on this one) ""Blood Mary"" ""Black Jesus/Amen fashion"" ""Bad kids"" ""Edge of glory""...these pop songs are top notch and that Gaga has shown on this record she can handle perfectly. Now I must stand out other ones on their own for personal reasons: ""Americano"" must be the song I like the least. The issue I have with this one is that it sounds full of latin cliches (acoustic guitars spanish vibe) and even the way Gaga sings sounds cliche. This could've been a decent B-side but not worth it to be on this great album. ""Hair"" is so far my favorite of this record. The music is great and it's memorable but the lyrics are simple and clever. When Gaga sings the line ""I am my hair"" establishing it as a part of her personality... hahaha! those are clever words to say to kids these days. Love it! The fact that I didn't mention the rest of the songs doesn't mean that they're not good in fact if you like rock music you might find ""Electric chapel"" and ""You and I"" guitar parts nice.Lady Gaga is a character to pay attention to on her own and eventhough I don't buy her whole image thing and her points of view on what she calls ""art"" her music is fun and really entertaining. If you ask me ""Born this way"" is a BIG step forward for Gaga since now she has proven she can make a good solid pop album. Now I'm just expecting from her to released a record that breaks her frame and goes beyond her own boundaries... what do I mean with this? well listen to Madonna's record ""Ray of light"" (1998) or ""American life"" (2003) and you'll know how I felt about Madonna herself when I thought the same about her.Congratulations to Gaga's new release. NOW I am a truly fan of her music."
I've seen other users have this problem so I'm glad to know it's not just me but only the digital booklet downloaded. Either Amazon needs to fix this issue or give us our 99 cents back.
"Say what you will about Lady Gaga but she's a bona fide talent. This album has it all. Gaga has evolved incredibly since her 2008 debut ""The Fame"" with the techno-pop disco songs ""Just Dance"" and ""Poker Face"" and the 2009 follow-up EP ""The Fame Monster.""  On ""Born This Way"" she opens with the rock-tinged ""Marry the Night"" but the album's first single and title track ""Born This Way"" is the true standout here.  Many have compared the song's sound to Madonna's ""Express Yourself"" but this is an unfair analysis.  Although the song's beat and message are distantly similar ""Born This Way"" is distinctly Gaga. It has become the unofficial dance anthem of misfits everywhere with the same universal message of acceptance and tolerance as Christina Aguilera's ""Beautiful.""Like Madonna Gaga is a frustrated schoolgirl at heart and this is most evident on the hit ""Judas"" which outraged officials at the Catholic Church (and of course got her plenty of headlines in the press). This is also evident on the song ""Bloody Mary"" complete with myriad references to the Virgin Mary and Christianity. There are also enough religious allusions in the song ""Electric Chapel"" to make any fundamentalist religious fanatic blush and perhaps that is the point.Gaga is a global artist which might explain the Spanish-tinged track ""Americano"" and the techno-disco ""Shei&szlig;e"" in which she sings a few lyrics in German. She also is not afraid to take on American myths of power and womanizing such as slain President F. Kennedy in the song ""Government Hooker"" in which she sings ""Put your hands on me/John F. Kennedy.""The power-pop ballad ""You and I"" could be by any classic rocker from back in the day in which Gaga professes drunken love to a ""Nebraska guy"" with of course more lyrical nods to the ever-elusive Jesus. Lady Gaga is a true provocateur."
"I will never understand the appeal of Lady GaGa.  Now I am a diva lover but GaGa is no diva.  The album is nothing but electronic drivel!  And the sad thing is that people call what she does as ""refreshing"" ""new"" and ""controversial.""  How??!  Madonna did everything and more than GaGa 20 or more years ago!  And with Madonna the music was good and at least in the earlier years focused on the song and not so much of this electronic vocoder ""my voice sounds like a computer"" garbage.  To me GaGa is talentless.I used to be a huge Madonna fan/collector until her music started sounding like electronic recycled drivel.  The problem is that all pop music sounds the same; overloaded with electronic synths.  You want real talent?  Download Adele's new album or Florence and The Machine.  True pop music is dying and GaGa isn't helping any.Listen to ""Government Hooker"" for example!  Absolute crap!  I'll admit there were certain tracks on Fame Monster that I liked but BTW is a horrid album that sounds like all other recycled electronic ick!  I understand that this generation needs a new gay icon I suppose but GaGa?  Stop capitalizing on the gays GaGa!  That's all she does!I know her album will and has sold millions.  I guess I'm just sad that pop music has devolved into such garbage!  Sad that we lost Amy Winehouse.  She was another one that made pop music come alive.So in other words all you 'lil monsters"" have horrid taste in music!"
"I see there are few 3 or 2-star reviews.  So it seems that a lot of people LOVE the album and more than a few hate it.  Only an artist with a lot of guts and more than a little talent could create that kind of polarity.I will admit that on first listen I was like ""huh?"".  But like another reviewer I have been won over by this album.There is NO ONE else out there who is as talented AND interesting AND smart as Gaga hands down."
"Born This Way was my first single from Mrs Gaga and as a Farmville player I was privy to hear the whole album on May 20.  The only songs that I really liked were ""Marry The Night"" ""Electric Chapel"" ""Fashion of His Love"" and ""You And I"".  The album version of the title track sounded like a remix and a poor one at that and so I prefer the single mix and also the Country Road Version to it.  ""Government Hooker"" ""ScheiBe"" are out un-listenable while the other songs just don't do anything for me.  While Gaga did not appeal to me with what I heard on the radio I thought that she may be on to something when I heard the title track and then the first three songs I mentioned above via Farmville unfortunately with the exception of ""You And I"" and the title track they would be the only songs I found appealing."
This album is so amazing. Gaga has definitely showed off with this album. All the songs are great!. She's just the best artist in this world!. :)
I bought this and had it downloaded to my cloud drive.  Only 4 songs and the digital booklet were stored there.  Be cautios about using cloud drive.
"The newest album by Lady Gaga is both artistic and historic.  With her sophomore effort Gaga sounds more like she travelled back in time rather than moved forward.  Gaga has established a reputation for pushing the boundaries of what is acceptable in both fashion and music and although a melodious throw back she retains this reputation with Born This Way.  The title track from the album has quickly become an anthem for every ""freak"" out there and clearly states the Lady's individuality and understanding of all the various walks of life experienced in the human species.  As a whole the album is decent but it definitely takes some warming up to.  While the track ""Born This Way"" is instantly likeable there are only a few other tracks that can make the same claim.  Other instantly listenable tracks are ""Marry The Night"" and ""You & I.""  The rest of the album tends to get lost in sound and mixed or juvenile metaphor as in the song ""Hair"" which leaves the listener thinking ""How awful must the rejected tracks have been from this album if such a poorly written lyric made it's way into the mix?""  Although from the public persona that Gaga portrays it seems unlikely that many people tell her ""No that's a bit too silly.""  While the general idea of the song touches on something truly American being free it is expressed in the equivocal manner of a pre-teen poem.  Similarly the track ""Bad Kids"" expresses a pre-teen hatred of parental control which I can only imagine will breed some ill-mannered disrespectful juvenile delinquents but at the very least the song is melodic enough to get your attention.  This being said I did find the two foreign language songs quite nice.  Although I can be a bit biased when it comes to this as I am a fan of hearing foreign languages sung or spoken.  ""Americano"" is both lyrically interesting and musically intriguing.  Gaga laces the latin vibe of guitars and ""la la"" chants with thick electronica.  The lyric also expresses a socially responsible message of worry for Gaga's generation acceptance of other cultures and the angst of loving someone if only for a little while.  Perhaps my favorite song on the album is ""Sheibe.""  While the exact translation of the German currently alludes me the gist is the recognition of your own flaws and the desire to be blind them and those of others.  The song is cool elegant dark and a bit strange just as you would expect from anyone who calls themselves Gaga."
First the single Born this way is a complete Madonna rip off. If you don't feel that way you were probably not alive in the 80's. But let's move beyond that. Gaga is very talented and this album is very creative. After listening to it a second time there are many catchy songs and she does have her own sound. I give her a lot of credit. After hearing Poker Face a few years ago I thought she would be a fade. Turns out she in it for the long run.
This is the kind of music i could listen all day! The entire CD is awesome every single song is perfect! I can't wait to see the next upcoming videos! My favorites songs: Highway Unicorn & Heavy Metal Lover!
"If there's one thing Lady Gaga is good at it's marching to the beat of her own drummer. No one can deny that while some of her style and musicality can definitely be traced back to earlier influences no one has done what Gaga does exactly the same way.While her sense of fashion has proven her a true chameleon as her music career continues she is showing herself to be very fond of repetition. There is a lot of ""Born this Way"" that can be easily compared to earlier hits of her career. Judas though catchy is almost a clone of ""Bad Romance"" right down to the chants and shameless insertion of her stage name. Most of the repetition however comes from songs on the album itself. The same beats voice alterations and synths surge through ""Born This Way"" leaving many of the tunes indistinguishable from the rest.It is natural that an artist carve a niche or create a known style that can easily be attributed to them but when your ""niche"" is supposed to be constant hyper-speed evolution Lady Gaga fails to deliver and stumbles through the album stuck in her ""Fame Monster"" phase.Perhaps Lady Gaga has set the musical bar too high for herself. It's almost impossible to change your sound as radically as she does her outfits but if it walks like a duck you halfway expect it to talk like one too. I don't think this is a *bad* album the intent here is clear as is the effort at creativity. However perhaps ""intent"" is the problem with ""Born This Way."" Gaga's fame seemed to come to her effortlessly songs about sex lust and drunkenly dancing about provided the world party anthems and a star with attitude to spare. Now that everyone is listening Gaga appears more conscious of what she has to say. That is truly the only artistic evolution ""Born This Way"" is evidence of."
"1. Marry The Night - 6/10 I am just not feeling this track at all. It hits me as too high of expectations for what she hyped it up to be (and what we were expecting with that epic instrumental).2. Born This Way - 7/10 Remarkably the more I listen to other tracks on the album the more I like this song. I hated it at first and it's still not one of my favorites. However it is so different from anything she's done so far.3. Government Hooker - 8/10 I really like this track a lot and it's fierceness is nice. Compared to the best dance tracks on the album though it's not as good. But it is still amazing in its own right.4. Judas - 9/10 I had to decrease this rating from a 10 because of You and I. But this song is one of my favorite GaGa uptempo song so far. It is good and it sounds so amazing when you're jamming in the car.5. Americano - 9/10 Other than the awkward introduction this song is BEAST. It is simply amazing the mariachi techno beats description was certainly appropriate. Another song to blast in your car.6. Hair - 5/10 Honestly my least favorite track on the album. I honestly can't believe that RedOne and Gaga made a track I didn't like. The meaning is contrived and honestly it sounds like something Miley would sing.7. Scheisse - 10/10 Now THIS SONG IS FIERCE. Easily one of the best on the album. The pulsating dance beats put you in a trance and you wanna stay that way.8. Bloody Mary - 9.5/10 Now THI S ROCKS. The instrumentation is my favorite she's done. It sounds so...epic. I absolutely adore it.9. Black Jesus / Amen Fashion - 8/10 - Based on the title I thought that I was going to hate it but I actually enjoy it a lot and get the message behind it. Definitely one of the stronger bonus tracks.10. Bad Kids - 8.5/10 Definitely a hard track and really interesting and epic. The intro is amazing and so is the chorus.11. Fashion of His Love - 8/10 I loved the ""Then You Love Me"" shoutout in the song it was a nice treat for the little monsters.12. Road to Love) 7.5/10 - Not really memorable to me but a good song nonetheless.13. Heavy Metal Lovers 8/10 - Fierce fierce track. Just hot.14. Electric Chapel - 9/10 Yet again she is slaying me with these instrumentals. They are so on point and key parts of the song. I love the eerie feeling of this song.15. The Queen 8.5/10 Prolly one of the best bonus tracks I love the meaning behind it and the PIANOOOO16. You and I 11/10 Honestly this is her best song to date. She will find it very hard to top herself with this. I do believe that the song did give me chills when she first performed it in June last year but she is doing the same thing EVERY time I listen to it.17. The Edge of Glory - 10/10 A Perfect Pop track. What more do you need?The album leaves little to be desired. The thematic direction and creative and artistic output present on the album more than compensates for the occasional weak track. Notice how I use the word ""weak"". That is simply because there are no BAD songs on this album and when you get right down to it that's what matters the most.5/5"
"I came to Gaga's defense when people compared the single Born This Way to Madonna.  I thought it had an early 90s vibe and a positive message but I did not think she was blatantly copying Madonna.  Until now.  This album is full of religious lyrics sax solos female empowerment messages etc.  It's all VERY Madonna from twenty years ago.  I understand that all artists today are influenced by Madonna but I'm honestly a little shocked at how much of Madonna Gaga has put into this album.  That being said I like Madonna's music from twenty years ago and I like most of the songs on this album.I love The Fame & Fame Monster.  My only real complaints about this album and Gaga in general right now are that she used to do things that were new and different but this album doesn't seem fresh and it feels like she is TRYING TOO HARD to be different.  But it's not different.  An Italian American Catholic girl writing vague lyrics about religion (and yes the lyrics are vague and don't make much sense--she shouldn't have to tweet and write on facebook and explain herself in interviews about what her songs mean--it's almost as bad as when she said the Meat Dress was somehow related to gay rights--a long shot--but I'm sure it makes sense in Gaga's head)...not original.She's just trying too hard to make art trying too hard to be different.  It all comes off as rather pretentious and annoying.I love Edge of Glory...I love Americano...Born This Way...the song where she speaks German...Bloody Mary is even good.  Those are my favorite.  I need to give the other tracks a few more listens.  I'm just disappointed because I was expecting something fresh and new from Gaga but this album feels tired.  When you are trying super hard to be different and artistic this is what you get.It's ironic because I feel like the same thing happened to Madonna...becoming pretentious and all of that...when Gaga gives us tears and acts like she still feels like a ""loser"" it all seems fake to me because 90% of the time she seems like she has a very high opinion of herself.  I bet she will start speaking with a fake English accent soon.All of the above aside this album is still much better than 95% of the pop junk out there and I do like it but I expect more from Gaga."
This album is phenomenal. Great music all around I think I could listen to this CD and not skip any songs. Lady Gaga took a great deal of time with this CD and it shows. Loves it.
"When Born this Way (single) came out I felt a bit disappointed. I was expecting a bit of darker more creative and poetic music from Lady Gaga. Yet the song grew on me. Judas impressed me very much by its lyrics and similarity in my point to Bad Romance. The Edge of Glory however I found to be the song she should have released as the first single from the album. When I first listened to the whole album I was a bit disappointed as it is very 80s pop and anthems rather than what I expected which was kind of a ""Marylin Manson-ish"" sound kind of techno and very rock. I gave the album another chance at redemption by forgetting all my preconcieved notions and just listening to the songs. Yes a few songs I don't like much such as Fashion of his Love Bad Kids Black Jesus and Electric Chapel which I find are too ""bubble-gum-pop"" lyrics for me.Now that all the ""negativity"" is out I will say that Bloody Mary and Americano are probably my absolute favorite songs on the album. Bloody Mary is very dark and edgy which I like and the lyrics are very creative. I love Americano for its artistic merit and its Spanish twists as it reminds me of The Fame Monster's Alejandro. Another good song is Heavy Metal Lover.In conclusion I find that the album is not bad at all but it isn't great. It'll probably grow on me later."
Only received 2 songs on the download.  For 99 cents that's not bad but not what I paid for.
This is not only a great album but also a great buy! Plus the digital book is awesome. I would recommend buying this album for all the little monsters out there!
My Son loves Lady Gaga and the digital Album is a STEAL! She is a very couragious beautiful woman and I myself love her songs too. The whole album is full of great songs and I'm glad I bought it though I only have 4 songs I'm waiting for the other 10.
Would love to leave a review of the music but as of this morning no download to my PC or Cloud.  Funny how easy it was for Amazon to download the money from my account.  My customers would be all over me if I ran business this way.  Disappointed.
Album of the year!! I love the motif of this album. so much more meaningful then anything else you'd hear on top 40 &lt;3
Amazon cloud is a great NEW product very happy so far.  Very very very happy with the .99 cent deal for this album. Love it! Thanx amazon!
I did not receive all the songs like many others.  I guess I got a few more than most; #3789 1112.  Don't off the album if you cannot deliver!
I bought Born This Way on the release date and have listened to it almost every day since.Every time I hear the album in it's entirety I hear new sounds and get something new and positive out of the lyrics.GaGa's Message is a very positive one of self exploration and finding your path and embarking on the journey no matter what obstacles may come your way.
This album is album of the year to me. The songs are so inspirtational + her message speaks to everyone. Hair happens to be my favorite song followed by JUDAS. :) You will deffinately like this album! Gaga is amazing + I love her. &lt;3
This album is very stylish with powerful and unwavering vocals from Lady Gaga on every track; her vocals unite a very electic and sometimes internationally flavored album. The production values on this album are through the roof and terrific. Lady Gaga manages to make a hybrid album from a wide variety of 80s sources: new wave in the manner of Depeche Mode 80s pop in the manner of Madonna 80s power-pop in the manner of Pat Benetar and 80s rock in the manner of Bruce Springsteen. It is also influenced by late 80s girl pop and there are 80s sound nuances 80s vocal hooks and hints of 80s optimism interlaced through the entire album. This album also incorporates 90s dance music German disco and Latin-flavored pop. It even manages to pay homage to Queen and The Eagles in the same song - You and I not an easy feat for any artist. The biggest downside for the album are the lyrics sometimes the lyrics are just cheesy (not in a good way) obvious strained and synthetic. On the plus side Lady Gaga spares her listeners from a ballad and she embraces a clever mosiac of soundscapes. The album flows quite well from start to finish as any well-crafted album should and most of the songs work better in their album format than as stand-alone singles. Suprisingly the album continously builds up momentum through tbe arrangement of its songs and it exits on a high note. All and all Lady Gaga has made an impressive pop album (good pop albums are always a rarity) and a cleverly constructed pop album that is multilayered and improves with subsequent listens.
"I was with a little apprehensive on buying (pre-order) this product because the DVD couldn't play in Europe. Then I had a chat with Amazon supporters and they told me to buy it and I did it. The delivery preview was December 24 but the product arrived last week. Faster than the preview and the best is that the DVD really works on European DVD players.The package was well protected and everything was ok.Lady Gaga is an awesome artist and this pack contains all of her latest works: ""Born This Way"" (album CD) ""Born This Way - The Remix"" (album CD) and ""The Monster Ball Tour At Madison Square Garden"" by HBO (DVD)!"
"I first saw Lady Gaga on David Letterman.  In spite of her ""over the top"" appearance she seemed to have her head together.  I believe she sang ""Born This Way"" and i liked the sound.  I went to Amazon and previewed the rest of the CD and decided to buy it.  I wasn't dissappointed.  The songs are uplifting and have a beat that makes you feel like dancing."
What can I say?  Some will hate her because of her success and some will love the messages she gives through song.  If you love to hate her that's fine too .... but she will always have dedicated fans such as myself.  Love it !
"Although I'm no way fan of Lady Gaga - the persona - her music always amazed me for the force and creativity. But here it's impossible even to find a ""just ok"" track. I just can't understand how from an album with so many creative  bombs came this complete tasteless trash. That's the biggest mystery we find here."
I love this women her songs are a must for a great cardio workout and to keep you going and going
Exactly what i expected and even faster than I thought! I have never bought from him before but I think we all should KEEP ON BUYING from him! Peace man! Thanks for the cool Thin Lizzy CD!!
"When Lady Gaga first hit it big I was annoyed by her and almost hated hearing her songs on the radio.I thought I was ""above"" her music and thought she would be one of those artists who disappears as quickly as she comes into our consciousness.I was a snob and I'm so sorry now.Because yeah -- this album. HOTTTTTTT."
lady gaga is great and this album is fantastic. this was an easy way to listen to a song immediately when i really wanted to hear it. great price!
"As a Lady Gaga collector I found myself buying this unquestioningly. But others might want to consider their options. For one you are buying a package of existing merch; there is no ""unique"" CD or DVD that is unavailable in other products.Do you or your giftee already own one or more of the items in the collection? If you don't care for duplicates you may want to go ahead and complete the set individually. This set is a good deal for someone who wants all pieces for a decent price. There is even a little new photography that makes it exciting. Other than that the packaging is pretty standard."
I loved this! Everything is perfect. I would rather have the monster ball dvd be blu-ray though. And the Born This Way The Remix is phenominal!
You like this mediocre Lady Gaga only if you eat a dish of s*** every day!Only mediocres like Madonna Spears Rihanna Beyonc&eacute; can be worse than Lady Gaga.This is the worst music ever done in all world's music history. If you have an IQ higher than 10 avoid this crap.
Great purchasegreat album at a very good price. After seeing lady Gaga on TV performing(Born this way) wanted this CD-DVD album in my collection. Definitely very satisfied. Product delivery was terrific. Would make future purchase from this Co. on Amazon
Like other reviewers I bought this album in part to support the need for intelligently valued music and I applaud the courage of Lady Gaga and her staff in working with Amazon in doing this. The other reason is that I like about half of the cuts; the others will need to find me in the right frame of mind. That being said I understand the whole performance art thing but the boundaries have been pushed about as far as I can stand. Lady Gaga has a wonderful voice and a great command of poetic imagery; now that is well known maybe she could ramp down the disturbing visuals and focus on her strengths. For example she was amazingly funny on Saturday Night Live with Justin Timberlake this last weekend; I would suspect that prior to her first song somebody who had not seen her before would have thought she was a member of the regular cast. I look forward to her hosting the program during the next season (I don't know if she's been asked I'm just starting the rumor).
Born This Way (Special Edition)This is the best album ever made ! There is nothing else I can say !
"The attractive thing about Born This Way - The Collection is the price. You'll save a lot more by getting this than if you buy the DVD and CDs separately. However if you're really picky do read on about the reviews on the individual items.Lady Gaga Presents The Monster Ball Tour:Well the only similarity this DVD has with Madonna's Truth Or Dare is the backstage black and white footage. Otherwise Truth Or Dare is more documentary than concert and Monster Ball is the reverse.I'm giggling as Monster Ball is rated Mature 18 in Singapore ostensibly for Lady Gaga mimicking male masturbation.The set list is fabulous most of her biggest hits are here including ALL songs from The Fame Monster. Expect lots of strange costumes and sets including a giant monster fish. I was so looking forward to see her jellyfish costume but it wasn't here (I saw it on YouTube). And did her male dancers enhance their packages or what?Most of the songs are full versions but Money Honey and Dance In The Dark are excerpts. Gaga's very lively on stage compared to the dead fish performances we sometimes get in Singapore from visiting pop stars.One major problem I had with the show was that Gaga was chatty to the point of verbosity. Her long drawn out ""soliloquies"" got rather tiresome. While I sympathize with her being sidelined in school she should air her grievances in an autobiography media interviews or her official webpage. She's got these avenues.Parts of the show are rather sacrilegious. Gaga calls her guitarist named Jesus Christ an a**hole for being ""disrespectful with that guitar"". She also mentions a bisexual dancer who is just like Jesus because he loves everybody. Is she trying to insult and ridicule Jesus Christ Son Of God through proxy? This was like watching The Exorcist. Gaga needs an exorcism.Born This Way The Album:I won't deny that the hits Born This Way Judas You And I The Edge Of Glory and Marry The Night are the best cuts here. Songs like Hair and Scheibe are also catchy. As with most albums fillers exist (Electric Chapel Government Hooker). The cover shot of Gaga she looks possessed.Born This Way: The Remix:Well I like this one slightly better than her earlier remix album. However I think mine is the minority vote. The Remix is kind of arty noises stuff they play in clubs during the off peak hours. Streamline could have used a better cover shot rather than this ragamuffin bag lady look.The packaging:Monster Ball and Born This way are housed in paper wallets with booklets while The Remix is in a singular envelope. The outer case is rather soft and is easily dented but features an arresting avant-garde look."
With the exception of Bloody Mary (which is a great song on a different level) and Bad Kids every single track puts me a really good and upbeat mood.  That's what I need to keep juggling everything that I am...
Good CD with several enjoyable songs that have not been played on the radio.  Not as good as her last one though.
This offer of a long-awaited blockbuster album by the widely admired international superstarfor 99 cents wasn't necessary.  We would have paid full price for the songs.  Amazon really f****d up royal.Tech support here was blindsided by overwhelming response but they should have anticipated it.Lady Gaga is a great musician songwriter and a dazzling amazing performer.She takes huge risks so people understand she is the real deal.The server was blasted by her tremendous popularity.Don't give the album a bad review just because of a delivery problem.  It's a really great album!
Oh Miss Gaga. She does it again. Something absolutely new. Compared to her last album. This is fresh and super exciting. Absolutely worth your money. Enjoy the cd.
This album is fantastic.  What more can I say?  Every song is unique and wonderful.  Her music suits tastes that cross so many genres.  Definitely recommend this album.
I love Gaga! Great CD. Ordered within prime and came to my door super fast! Allher hits are on this cd
I really liked Fame and Fame Monster. Both demonstrated Gaga has style flair great voice range funky songs danceable yet good melodies.After seeing the video release for Edge of Glory I was already surprised at how boring and typical and crappy that song was. Then Born This Way while I appreciate the positive message basically rips off the melody of Madonna's Express Yourself (Try singing singing Express Yourself over the music while you play Born this Way).I'm bummed. I was expecting awesome things from Gaga. But instead she went from unique melody plus cool style to...low budget anthropomorphic motorcycle and crappy club techno. Overall BLAH.
It is Lady Gaga of course it rocks! I put this album on my computer mp3 player and cell phone.
If all of your songs are not showing up check your order status it probably still says PENDING!!!  And if your songs don't show up by tomorrow then contact Amazon through chat give them your order number and they will fix everything. This is not the end of the world.
Contrary to every other reviewer I was able to download the whole thing and have it playing on my iPod as we speak.  Apparently I must have hit Amazon at the right time of the day.  I think it's a bit unfair to penalize the music for Amazon's unfortunate glitch.  I am not a Lady GaGa fan but thought that at $.99 I couldn't beat it.  As it turns out I like at least four songs so I'm coming out ahead.  I'm old enough to remember Donna Summer's disco; Lady GaGa sounds like a more technological version of disco.  It's great for dancing and working out.  Thanks Amazon for offering such a great deal!
An aggressive dance album full of electronica beats and numerous potential singles is what she gives her fans. This highly anticipated album delivers to the masses the key to Lady Gaga's success cutting edge production and well crafted songs with memorable hooks. The subject matter much darker and than on her previous CD exploring politics and religion but that is what artist do with their art they evolve grow and create a dialogue for discussion. I am so very relieved she did try to capitalize on her Fame success and release a part 2 like so many other artist would have done. Did we expect anything less from her?
I have been a fan for many years but I am quite disappointed by the release from GAGA. I listened through the music twice and hear quite a lot of repetition between this album and her other released music.  This time it wasn't just a plethora of useless remixes. There really are only 3 tracks on this new release that stand out as being different from her past recordings but there is clearly sampling (intentional or not) of music from other well known artists. On CD 1 there are 3 songs in a row that cannot be differentiated from each other.  It was extremely boring to listen to that section. Let's see if some innovative videos can add life to this album. Doubtful.I've returned to listening to Monster instead of this DEAD ON ARRIVAL GAGA release.July 15th 2011:  2 months have passed since I received the CD.  Haven't been inclined to play it again.  GAGA missed with this CD and her videos to try and support this CD are quite poor.  Back to MONSTER if I need to listen to GAGA.
Why would any guy like gaga? Her music is lame and its not like they are gonna kiss her or even marry her ha haAnyway I prefer to stick too Frank Zappa Grateful Dead etc. jazz and techno music.
So unless Amazon fixes the download issues I'll stick with my 1 star. If you advertise the album for as much as %0.99 while Steve Jobbs offers %9.99 get your download services up and running!!!!!
"It seems that so much attention has been given to Lady Gaga's resemblance to Madonna and her using the gay community as a marketing tool that her music has been overlooked. And that's a shame because ""Born This Way"" is a gem with some amazing songs. ""Marry the Night"" is a piano ballad with vocals as soft and smooth as honey and opens the album. The chorus arrives in an eruption of drums and power chords and the sound gets bigger and bigger. As that song ends Gaga holds true to her promise to deliver ""sledge hammering dance beats"" throughout the rest of the tracks. A triumph in sound engineering she uses a variety of ways to open her tunes: pizzicato strings operatic vocals 80s rawk guitar and then soon engulfs them all in buzz saw synths and robo-precise rhythms that make an instant impact. She touches on various themes: religion (""Judas"" and ""Bloody Mary"") freedom (""Road to Love"") identity (""Hair"" and ""Born This Way"") and hammers home the message like only Lady Gaga can. ""Scheisse"" has a ridiculously catchy chorus with Eurodisco-influenced techno beats. ""You and I"" is a beautiful piano ballad that offers a breather from the hammering pace set by the first few songs. ""Edge of Glory"" features some rad Clarence Clemons played saxophones that add a unique texture and is apparently a love song to her late grandfather. ""Bad Kids"" pays tribute to the NYC club kids era with a chorus that catches you and pulls you in. Everything about ""Born This Way"" is meant to provoke a reaction and as such it is a perfect expression of Lady Gaga's attention-hungry public persona. Highly recommended!!!"
"Inspired by 90's techno industrial 80's dance 80's metal Madonna Whitney and electro Lady Gaga returns with an album of epic scale.  ""Born This Way"" christened ""album of the decade"" by Gaga herself is a mash-up in concept.  80's metal tracks from the likes of hair bands like Motley Crue and Bon Jovi collide with tracks from early 90's techno/rave groups like 2 Unlimited and 80's pure pop tracks from Madonna and Whitney.  On first listen the edgy aggressive sound may be hard to swallow as it doesn't sound anything like her previous two multi-million selling albums but as you let the album unfold  and take you on its journey you start to wonder if Gaga hit the nail on the head with this project and if this is where pop music is headed next.  You start to realize that you miss hearing grand and inspiring choruses and real vocal strength in music and then you realize that by breaking rules and not giving us another album of mainstream pop hits Gaga just gave us the next pop sound.  I havent heard a 74 minute album (if you get the deluxe edition) since the late 90's/early 2000s and as far as I'm concerned it is still not long enough.  This is a full story album...THIS is bionic.Highlights on the album are:Schei&szlig;eBloody MaryBad KidsFashion of His Love (Why isn't this fab track on all versions of the album?)You And IEdge of GloryTRACK BY TRACK:1- Marry The Night - This sounds like an amped up 80's metal/rock/dance version (claps and all) of Cutting Crew's 1986 hit ""I Just Died in Your Arms Tonight.""2 - Born This Way - Title track and first single from this album becoming Gaga's 3rd #1 Billboard Hot 100 and staying in the pole position for over 8 weeks.3 - Government Hooker - Electro pop dark dance track with blips and all.  I expect to hear this type of sound at an industrial/goth dance night.  Very metal distorted vocals She sings in a lower register there are spoken vocals cold male spoken vocals creepy laughs throughout.  Its somewhat anti-climactic but does help to establish a cold industrial tone early on.4 - Judas - This ones already been broken down and analyzed a million times.  Truthfully I like it.  Its a faster Bad Romance with a highly addictive chorus.  She collaborates with ""Just Dance/Pokerface"" hit-maker RedOne.  The video on the other hand....hot mess.5 - Americano - This track is sung in a very annoying campy ""Broadway"" style.  It's her one Latin-inspired dance track with pulsating drum beat trumpet guitar and violins in the far background but is just too busy with the distorted screamy vocals the pulsating Latin dance beat the guitars the horns.  Think Madonna's Deeper and Deeper on steroids meets ""Me No Speak No Americano"". This one goes to the bottom of the list for me.6 - Hair - The first time we hear the sax on this album.  This was released before the album came out on iTunes so we've all had the opportunity to digest it.  Its a fun party track with  electric guitar piano hard pulsey drum machine and sounds like it came right out of the late 80's.  Throw your hands in the air dance anthem.  This track seems to fuse the industrial goth elements of the album with the 80's dance metal rock inspired tracks.7 - Schei&szlig;e - One of the strongest tracks on the album once again reminiscent of a previous Gaga track.  Great vocals spoken singing takes me to an early 90's techno industrial place ala ""Twilight Zone"" ""Who Shot JFK.""8 - Bloody Mary - Mid tempo operatic; the cold industrial goth ""Ladytron""-esque sister to ""The Fame's"" Ace of Base inspired ""Alejandro."" This is a major highlight on the album. A+ dark moody mid tempo synth dance track.9 - Black Jesus - Amen Fashion - very electro-rock distorted spoken chorus meets very 80's sounding melodic verse/bridge meets an uninspired chorus that is almost reminiscent of Gaga's previous soundtrack song ""Fashion"" mixed with title track ""The Fame.""  Another track I could easily live without.10 - Bad Kids - pulsating disco beat with electric guitars reminiscent of Donna Summer's ""Hot Stuff"" and another disco gem that I can't think of at the moment.  Half-spoken half sung verses meets a glorious synthy chorus which is mixture of 80's and 90's classic jams.  This track reminds us of Gaga's melodic sugary pop genius. A+ Highlight!11 - Fashion of his Love - This one almost sounds like it was inspired by ""Express Yourself"" as well but upon further listen you realize that it was THIS song where she pictured ""Whitney Houston.""  This is the young sister to classic 80's #1 track ""I Wanna Dance With Somebody.""  Lady Gaga sings fashiony lyrics over a hot 80's freestyle (think of Whitney's ""Dance w/ Somebody"" meets Shannon's ""Let the Music Play."")  One of the best songs on the album.  The double disc special edition is the only edition of the release that contains both the original along with a Fernando Garibay mix which is completely dance/club ready.12 - Highway Unicorn (Road To Love) - Another 80's dance rock track.  Not fond of the distorted vocals.  I feel like if she included more melodic softer vocals it could have balanced this hard track.13 - Heavy Metal Lover - Dark sleek sexy dance track.  One of the most easily accessible tracks on the album.  Similar in style to ""Government Hooker"" but much sexier.  This song is almost a culmination of the different styles that inspired this record and this song perfectly balances all elements and highlights all of Gaga's strengths.14 - Electric Chapel - Electric guitars pulsating electro beat sexy dreamy vocals.  This could have been a track on Madonna's Confessions On A Dance Floor record and sounds similar to ""Forbidden Love"" from that same album.15 - The Queen - fast paced 80's pop dance track ala GoGo's but the melody also reminds me of Cher's ""Song for the Lonely.""  The pace drops midway and this goes from being a dance track to a slow to mid tempo pop track with an electric guitar solo that closes the number.16 - You and I - Epic gem the speechless of this album. Major highlight.  The only true ""ballad"" on the album and very similar in structure to a Bon Jovi track or even actually reminds me of ""What It Takes"" from Aerosmith.  Showcases Gaga's stunning vocals and melodic mastery.17 - The Edge of Glory - fast paced hi-energy feel-good electro dance track highlight and because it was so successful during the iTunes countdown to Gaga pre-release it is officially the third single for this release."
very good LP with excellent songs but there's no contains inside(photos lyrics) so 4 stars this item is less good than the Fame LP (for the contain only)
Loved it! had no trouble downloading it--definitely worth the money---would have preferred the uncensored version but for 99 cents I am not complaining.  As always Gaga is not only great dance music but great dance music with meaning--reading her lyrics to me is like reading poetry so the music is great on 2 levels.  Not sure why folks are trashing the album (aside from Amazon crashing which of course has nothing to do with the music) other than what folks always do--go after someone on top and try to pull them down. Gaga has earned her way and this album is evidence.  A great great album.  Love you Gaga! Paws Up Baby!!
I downloaded the album no problem to my cloud player. People need to quit crying Amazon is giving us a great deal at a $.99. Hello dont you think that it would get busy and there would be some delays? Go buy the album for $12.00 if it's that serious.Ok album bought it because it was so cheap lol.Thanks Amazon. I will continue to buy my music from you and love the great deals we can get!!
"Ok I am from South Africa this Friday I am off to see the controversial Queen Monster in Johannesburg showcasing her ""Born this way Ball World Tour"" would have never decided to go if it was not for the actual CD ""Born this Way"" you see I was never a Gaga fan The Fame did nothing for me except for a few tracks like Poker Face Just Dance and Eh Eh (Nothing Else I can say) but I did not bother buying the CD. The Fame Monster got my attention with the Bad Romance Epic Video also Alejandro and Telephone tracks have great videos and are okay songs I appreciated Lady Gagas hard work and creative abilities in her music and videos even though I would cringe at some of her imagery and symbolisms within them.Born this Way was a surprise to me I remember all the hype decided to buy the CD and thoroughly enjoyed it from beginning to end it's a single led pop/dance/rock masterpiece the work and time taken in the production is mind blowing her improved theatrical vocals impressed me greatly too:Marry the night (4/5):  A great Opener very rock diva driven a great vocal and song weird video but good enough to get you dancing.Government Hooker (4/5): Amazing track great hard beat and typical sassy diva in heat vocal great track.Born this way (5/5)  One of her finest tracks with a rocking message do not care that it has similar tones to Madonna's Express Yourself Madonna is also a queen of taking popular ideas and making it her own Vogue being one of them ain't nothing wrong with that a riveting devilish but creative video this song went straight to Number 1 all over the world and propelled the album to have the biggest opening weeks sales of over a million in the first week love this track.Judas: (5/5) I do not understand why I love this track so much but I do they say it's the little sister to Bad Romance I can see the similarities but its a rocking track on its own the hard beat in the verse with her tough rough raw vocal then a sweet gentle vocal in the chorus Juda Juda aaaa this is one my favourite tracks it should have been a number 1 although it did in Korea and a few other places worldwide. Love the video choreography an EPIC track.Americano: (4/5) I like this track it's different a theatrical vocal another aggressive sound with a hint of a latino salsa vibe this track is attitude at its best.Hair: (3/5) Hair is a great track too but not one of my favourites great lyric and great vocal no complaints here.Scheisse: (5/5) Looooove this track with a German intro always thought German is such a strong scary language but it works with an incredible spoken bridge and sassy chorus cannot wait to see this one live on Friday. The beats on this track typical dance/pop funk amazing love it.Bloody Mary: (5/5) Love this track got that old school 80s pop vibe intertwined with a theatrical opera feel great lyric and vocal again love the beat and synthesizers with the additional background vocals GAGA GAGA at the bridge that petshop boy sound another favourite.Amen Fashion: (3/5) An ok track not my favourite maybe because I am abit sensitive to the phrase ""Black Jesus"" tend to sometimes skip this one but its not bad at all.Bad Kid: (4/5): This track started off as a least favourite but that chorus and bridge got me and now I love it a great message of liberation to those kids out there who feel somewhat not loved and misunderstood.Highway Unicorn: (4/5): Her epic opening for her Born this way Ball tour a great track too powerful vocal love how the song is structured production wise very dramatic and intense.Heavy Metal Love: (5/5): Love love love this track mainly for the production synthesizers hard core beat with a hard core I am gonna eat u up vocal play this track on max volume and shatter your eardrums its dark delicious and another favourite of mine.Electric Chapel: (2/5): Least favourite of the bunch but do not get me wrong it's a good track with a catchy guitar rift a more subtle vocal by gaga got an 80s pop vibe to it which I love since I am a kid of the 80s.You and I: (3/5): I like this track a nice melody a country kind of feel with a hard beat under it a great vocal by Gaga with the typical country backing vocal like a Shania Twain track who I am also a fan of the video is quite a spectacle a good song.The Queen: (5/5): Now this is my track the favourite of the lot love it love it love it a fusion of pop/rock with a gutsy vocal and catchy chorus it builds on and on then gradually demodulates to a slower groove towards the end reminds me of a Freddy Mercury Queen music love her vocal a pity she has not done a video or performed it on her Born this Way ball tour it's a masterpiece.Fashion of his Love: (3/5) for the track on main born this way CD on the DELUXE EDITION the remixed version by Fernando Garibay gets a (5/5) I love this version it should have been the one on the main CD I love this track so much her vocal is amazing and a memorable chorus and bridgeThe Edge of Glory: (5/5): Another masterpiece to bring the CD to a close love her vocals on this track another Rock/POP masterpiece EPIC.I will always have issues with Gaga on some of her ideologies and her choices in how she chooses to express herself creatively but musically and visually she is one of the best out there I take my hat off for her hard work bravery talent and tenacity this is one of the best pop records of the 20th Century even though I do not consider myself a monster I understand the hype well done girl."
I'm not a HUGE Gaga fan but figured this was a great price for her album.  Took a bit to download but c'mon for the price it's worth retrying.  Got half through the first time then the immediate retry got the other half.  Still a deal.  People needn't be impatient at this price.
I can't believe there are so many negative reviews. Take your misplaced anger and contact amazon rather than leaving a bad review for Lady Gaga. Thanks to this fiasco I doubt she or her producers will be green-lighting anything like this in the future.Personally I've been trying to download this album for the past 5 hours but I'm not petty enough to give this enjoyable album a bad review because of it. I like what I've heard so far. I don't consider myself to be a little monster so I like the promo because I'm going to be listening to Lady Gaga something I never might have considered otherwise.
You did it again Gaga!!  Thanks for inspiring us all.With love always...little monster
Had some difficulties downloading the album all morning but it was to be expected with the new album being sold so cheap by Amazon. Finally managed to get the whole album in the evening and it rocks! Thanks Amazon! Love your Mp3 store!
The description says that you get all the songs.. Do NOT believe it. I downloaded it and got 3 songs and the digital booklet. That was it! I'm not very happy with Amazon at the moment. If you're going to advertise that it's the whole album for $.99 then deliver what you advertise!This was also my first purchase of digital mp3's from Amazon and I will never do it again! Sticking with iTunes!!!
"The overall product is awesome.It's 2 vinyls with four sides. It includes all 14 of the regular version songs plus the three that are on the deluxe edition. When you open the vinyl you see the GaGa-bicycle that is the cover of the original 14 song version album. The back as the picture of GaGa learning over with the tracks listed as they appear on the sides of the vinyls.The labels are pretty bland though nothing like what's on ""The Fame"" labels. The sleeves have listed on them ""This is for &uuml; with the heart around it assuming you know who she is talking about (her boyfriend/ or more?) ...I haven't spun it yet but assume the quality will be good as what the Fame and The Fame Monser is. Also I assume that its censored just like the Fame Monser vinyl is with the infamous bleeps on this record like the song Government Hooker.About the quality of the music it is good. I have heard the music all except The Queen and am in love with every single song!If you are a GaGa fan a little monster :P you should enjoy this if you have a turntable."
Lady Gaga's new CD Born This Way is truly amazing.  It has great dance beats and the lyrics are very catchy.  She is truly an amazing artist with tons of creativity and talent.  The music is also mixed so you get a variety of different tones and beats.  I love every single song on this album but my favs are government hooker; Bloody Mary and JUDAS.
This is ridiculous... 10 hours since I purchased the CD and still only have 7 songs... give me a break!!!!
Sure the download was slow but in the end it worked.(and 3 tracks needed to be re-downloaded that's what the amazon downloader is for)I've already listened to the album 6 times. Good stuff!
The releases of Hair and Edge of Glory as singles almost had me convinced that Born This Way would disappoint but I'm very impressed now that the entire album is out.  Unlike The Fame I feel like I can appreciate nearly every song on the album.  Although I don't expect any of the songs to be as big of a hit as Bad Romance I feel like several of them (Bloody Mary and Schei&szlig;e especially) are nearly just as good as Bad Romance only lacking qualities that would make them ideal candidates for singles.  Hope she keeps up the good work.  Absolutely worth even regular price.
"I hate to say it since I love Lady Gaga but this album is very disappointing. I loved just about every single track that came from her first 2 albums but with this one she's changing her sound and I just don't care for the change at all. I actually bought the ""Special Edition"" 2 CD set and out of 17 songs (not counting the remixes on the second disk) there's only 1 song I love and then 2 others that I just like. ""Scheibe"" is the one song that sounds like something from her earlier 2 albums and I love it! Great dance song with a funky sound and some fun lyrics. ""Americano"" and ""Government Hooker"" are the other 2 that I just like. They're good-but-not-great songs.And that's it. The rest of the album is just ""eh"". This new sound is a little harsher and more rock-oriented to my ears anyway and that is not what I want to hear from ""Mother Monster"". It's her career and her choice obviously and if this is the way she wants to go now so be it. I'll just be very sad to lose what was once a great artist for some very fun and different dance-oriented music."
"My God this ""Lady"" already sounds so old (and tawdry)! This album sounds like a poor effort of end career. There is no elegance no search for anything new...just huge amounts of sounds and effects and when it comes to create something that could be a melody...it sounds so old (and tawdry)! Already..."
"Only Gaga and take Pop and turn it into the masterpiece that is ""Born This Way"". This is an album truly for her fans. Best 99 cents I've ever spent.Favorite songs: Marry the Night Government Hooker You and I The Edge of Glory"
Tell me why you love this dynamic lady talented as ever. i love that she is her own drama queen. And Queen she is. I love every sone on this cd. I just love her being a performer of the year.
"I love this album! I waited SO long for it and wasn't dissapointed! She goes through various music styles including country mariachi medieval-like heavy metal rock techno even opera! The variation is great she made great meaningful lyrics with great background music and isn't ""plastic"" like other singers that use auto-tune or lip sing and don't write their own songs. I love Gaga! Thank you for this incredible album! Best EVER!"
Love it! it is great!!!standouts:Marry the nightBloody MarryHeavy Metal LoverBad KidsBut i love every song!
I've been planning on buying some of the $5 albums Amazon has available but this one is too good to pass up for the 20GB of storage.Thanks GAF.
"I listened to the artist before she became Lady Gaga. Her voice was amazing; I thought she would have made a phenomenal star. Well she did... The fact that I don't particularly care for the kind of music that she sang since she decided that it was even more important (for her) to shock people did not prevent me from listening to the samples on Amazon today as the whole album is $1.Well I don't think it is worth the dollar. At least not to me. The music on this album is forgettable. All that I remember is the harsh beat not any of the songs. Feels like a car with the music loud on stopping at the light right by you. After it leaves you will remember: ""boom boom boom"" but not the song."
Got hooked by the .99 download offer so I thought I'd try it. Unfortunately it is NOT the whole album for that price. 3 songs and the digital book. The three songs that they allowed are hopefully not the best ones on the album since they really fell short. So I'm giving this album a one star based on the fact the offer was not good and the 3 songs offered were not that great.
"The power of music and fanfare can draw the masses and Lady Ga Ga has succeeded in doing just that.  Indeed the title track of the album ""Born this way"" is a jumping dance number that had already made waves that thousands have compared to Madonna's ""Express Yourself"" yes the inspirational lyrics and the slight melody and rhythm.  But for this listener this song as well as a few of other tracks on the album possess an array of musical influences of rock and cabaret that even go back to the sounds of the late 1970s and 1980s Donna Summer Abba Rickie Lee Jones Elton John Queen and many others; the sound can be heard underneath all of the electronica hence the tracks ""You and I"" ""Electric Chapel"" ""Americano"" ""Hair"" and ""Bad Kids.""Besides the comparisons all the songs on the record have a unique quality.  Indeed there is a bit of electronic experimentations but who can deny that important element when the album's production as noted on the liner notes (the digital booklet with the song lyrics and provocative photo portfolio) occurred at the legendary Abbey Roads Studios; where rock and classic music was and is still being produced.  An amazing fact to know for music lovers and Lady Ga Ga following in the tradition as many others before her."
"She really changed her sound with this cd..it's much more ""techno"" than before and not nearly as good as her first two cd's.  There are a couple of good songs (Born this way and Judas) but the rest is just so so."
"For years I have heard people say ""If Lady Gaga is as 'different' as she claims to be why is her music so mainstream?"" Finally I can point them to Born This Way. It highlights everything great about Gaga. Every song on the CD lets you hear the different sides of her and the emotions she deals with. She sounds so real and easy to identify with. Like other reviewers have said before me don't expect the Fame or the Fame Monster. She has really laid it all out for people to hear and you either appreciate it or you don't. I would honestly give this more than 5 stars if I could so I'm definitely recommending it."
This is a GREAT album and Lady Gaga has a wonderful voice!  I'd definitely recommend this for everyone to listen to!
I'm a 34 year old Little Monster.  I'm old enough to hear swear words.  I can produce a note from my mother to show to the nice people at amazon.com a little permission slip if you will.  It does not state on the site that this is a censored version of the CD...atually its the Special Edition so if anything it should be unmarred by some censor's eraser and their opinion of what I should and should not hear.Little Monsters take their Gaga quite seriously.  We have been waiting since New Years Eve for the 5/23/11 release date.  I preordered from Amazon knowing that other stores would be censored and past experiences with Amazon orders have had CD here on drop date or the very next day.  Drop date was Monday I got mine Wednesday...and now I have to send it back....AND they told me they DO NOT have a non censored version available.  Unacceptable.
There are a few cheesy songs on here like Born This Way Hair and the Unicorn song but there are also some real bangers like Schei&szlig;e Gov't Hooker etc.  Gaga is very creative and this is an interesting album.
If you're expecting music like you got on The Fame you will be surprised (but not disappointed!)  The songs flow so well together have really danceable beats and if you know the meanings of many of the songs very powerful lyrics.  I find myself wanting to just listen to this album all day and I feel like I like each song more and more the more I hear them.
DO NOT BUY THIS FROM HERE!!!!!!!!!  IT IS A RIP OFF!!!  i HAVE BEEN DOWNLOADING FOR OVER ONE HOUR AND ONLY ONE SONG HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY DOWNLOADED.  iF YOU CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE YOU GET SOMEONE FROM INDIA WHO CAN BARELY SPEAK ENGLISH AND THEN GET TOLD THAT ITS A TECHNICAL PROBLEM NOT A CUSTOMER SERVICE PROBLEM!!!
It gets you moving.  I enjoy dancing to most of the tunes.  Some of them were a little too long for me.  But I  liked it for the most part.
"I figured I'd wait until nearly a year had passed tosit down and give this album a full proper listen. I thought if the dust had settled I'd be able to give it a serious listen and yes I have made it this far without listening to front to back. Usually the comparison I make when I listen to albums I compare them to a conversation. And this conversation? Well it rambled and wandered off... but I listened alright.Look I will admit I am a tad biased toward Gaga I'll admit I hated her at first but i quickly got into The Fame album and the Fame Monsters EP. however I wasn't pleased when I heard the lead singles off this album- the first was a Madonna ripoff and Judas sounds like something too crappy to make it onto Dance Dance Revolution.The biggest problem with this album is it's too long and it rambles too much. There's 14 tracks and there don't need to be 14 tracks- at least 25% of the songs feel like b-sides. Not even good enough for that- I'd call them Z-sides. All the songs sound exactly the same!!! All of them have the same thump thump thump beat and while it may sound fun the first few tracks for the rest of them it just sounds boring.There's only a handful of tracks I really like on this disc. ""Bloody Mary"" mainly because it reminds me of early Garbage material and Lady Gaga sounds a lot like Shirley Manson on it. Her voice is so beautiful on it its insane. ""Heavy Metal Lover"" is fun and quirky delightfully naughty and just an enjoyable track all around. I also really like ""Scheisse"" it's funny and surprisingly has a good message too.That's about it. ""Marry the Night"" is boring and whiny crap. We already know how much I hate the eponymous track and Judas. Government Hooker is BLAND. Hair is cheesy and awful. Actually we already know what I'm about to say...If you want a good disc by a female artist I suggest you invest in ""Blonde"" by Coeur de Pirate ""Born to Die"" by Lana Del Rey or even the new Madonna disc. But by all means avoid this disc. It's boring and bland and enough to put anyone off Gaga."
Yeah I had to wait 24hrs for Amazon to work things out due to their complete lack of preparedness for the volume of purchases this deal created but it was worth the wait.  Great tracks...if you like Gaga you'll enjoy the album.  If you don't like her well why did you buy the album?  If you want to be convinced she's talented you need to watch/listen to her perform live--this is where she stands apart from her contemporaries.
happy to find the 99 cent deal bc i wouldn't have bought the album at full price - not a huge fan of either singles and i expect to only use the album amongst my workout playlist when runningi like the song you & i but none of the other songs have really stood out to me so far  maybe it will grow on meand as far as the 99 cent album deal goes - all songs downloaded properly for me so if there was an earlier issue it seems to be fixed. my review is for the album not amazon - amazon gets a five star review from me.
"Lady Gaga sucks. 99 cents is still too much for this album especially when you take into account that every ""sale"" boosts her ranking in the charts."
I can't complain. I already had the Amazon Cloud Player installed from previously purchased MP3s. By the time it took me to open the Cloud Player after I purchased this MP3 album all of the songs were already installed and ready to play.Another great bargain from Amazon.If you want to build up a classical music library try their classical album downloads for the best bargains anywhere.
"I really wasn't impressed with the two singles released from this album. I was going into this with low expectations (but at 99cents how can anyone resist?!). So far I'm as unimpressed by the album as a whole as I was by the singles.A few standouts are: ""You And I"" which has a bit of an Elton John sound to it. ""The Edge of Glory"" is pretty awesome and brings me back to the likes of Pat Benatar or 80's anthemic rock (""Marry The Night"" and ""Hair"" also fall into this category but not as good). ""Americano"" is pretty fun and quirky and probably my favorite so far (must be cuz it stirs up my Latino sangre). ""Heavy Metal Lover"" has a really nice dreamy/New Agey sound to it that I love with some sugar techno on top.""ScheiBe"" is like a rehash of previous Gaga but I feel that I'll start to love it after hearing it a few times more. I appreciated a tiny homage to Michael Jackson at the beginning of ""Bad Kids"" (assuming Michael didn't get it from someone else himself).The rest seems to alternate between the worst of Madonna (""Government Hooker"" ""Bloody Mary"") and more of what I consider Gaga's own cliche gone wrong (--what I love about Gaga is mainly her ability to switch a song 3 or more times throughout and make it seem smooth and groovy but in this album it's not nearly as smooth and feels like a cheap imitation of her skill---). If you knew me personally you'd know how much it pains me to compare her to M but...it is what it is.The reason I don't give it 1-star is because Lady Gaga is a true artist and you can hear it in this album more than in The Fame/The Fame Monster. It's very different and you can sense her love of music and the effort she put into it to make it different than anything else out there. But...you just won't find anything as unique and exciting as ""Bad Romance"" or as fun and funky as ""Just Dance"" or even as catchy and danceable as ""Telephone.""  Except maybe in the exceptions I listed above.But it's 99cents and I'm no music expert. I just go by what sounds good to my ears (you'll notice I mention nothing about lyrics but other reviewers have noted her awesome song-writing and how political her songs can be). So it's worth checking out for yourself. Great deal any way you slice it. And please be patient the songs will become available if you give a bit."
Comes with 2 CD Deluxe Edition :) i love it so good and looks great too. It comes with the sticker on the front of the album and the album book is great.
More varied and remarkable tracks from the Princess of Pop.  An exploration of Gothic styles and personal expressions of musical art..
"The best review of this latest totally unoriginal piece of garbage is ""the most litigation ready song ever released"" - come on - it's a total Madonna rip-off. Can GaGa or GooGoo (or whatever her kindergarten moniker is) do ANYTHING original? She steals from every disco era singer - yes disco. Madonna Donna Summer - you name it. Lyrics melody and with this steaming pile the actual music."
"I have enjoyed Lady Gaga's music since I first heard ""Just Dance""-- clearly a dance record.  Since then with all of her hits she has proven to be more than just a dance queen. She is a pop music icon in the image of many artists including Madonna Robyn Cher Blondie with bits and pieces of rock techno electronica and jazz in the mix. Her icon status is no accident. She clearly makes the effort to explore varied styles and subject matter with her music which gives this album Born This Way an ecclectic feel providing something for everyone.Let's break it down into different categories. For romantic there's Marry the Night a kind of valentine to NYC Fashion of His Love with clothing as a metaphor for passion Hair representing individual style and You and I a  pure expression of devotion.We have anthems dedicated to personal pride and ambition: Born This Way Highway Unicorn and The Edge of Glory. Her increasing boldness is evident with socially relevant tracks Government Hooker Americano and Bad Kids.Finally there's what I love most about her: songs reaching the edge of contraversy.  Judas and Scheisse. The latter which is basically a German curse word is interesting considering the record label's censoring of curse words.  I was annoyed with the bleeping but I am not surprised after the word b**** bleeped out on The Fame Monster. Now we have to black out in liner notes as well as bleep out s*** and f***. Yeah I know I'm bleeping them out too cause I don't want my review withheld but why not release two versions clean and explicit? Probably a budget issue. After all this release contains a decent amount of music full lyrics elaborate photography and even thicker paper for the booklet. I believe Gaga's Scheisse is a dig at that censoring she knew the label would employ. I really love the sound of that track too its Lady Falco! Yeah!As far as Judas her catholic upbringing clearly is an influence. But why not pit Judas as the opposite of Jesus if one regards these individuals as men and categorizes contemporary men as one or the other. The same bible story is on her mind with Bloody Mary ""When Pontius comes to kill the king...I'm ready for their stones."" So maybe she is ready to defend some modern day savior or she compares herself to Jesus and sometimes feels like Judas. At this point with all her success I think she is entitled. Let some folks call it blasphemy--its simply freedom of speech.If we ignore the lyrics and focus just on her sound there is quite an 80's influence but in a good way. She is not copying the metallic synth pop but rather borrowing jazz saxophone electric guitar and dance beats from that era and making it all an original Gaga creation. For me Electric Chapel was the most reminiscent of the 80's and kinda sounded like something Madonna would have released then.  And yes Born This Way is a little like Madge's Express Yourself in the chorus.  Of course the saxophone on Edge of Glory and Hair is by the great Clarence Clemons from the E Street Band which gives us a little Springsteen rock and You and I has elements of Queen's We Will Rock You. No matter how we define her sound the music is infectious the lyrics catchy and you will want to lather rinse and repeat the experience over and over and over again.*******The Special Edition has the added bonus of the Country Road Version of Born This Way on disc 2. I love this version because the simplicity of the arrangement allow us to really listen to the lyrics. The rest of the second disc contains excellent dance remixes which we would expect from Gaga and is fun to listen to in the car for a short trip."
I wasn't really sure if I wanted to pay more than ten bucks for this album. Then amazon was like you want it for less than a dollar?! Ha I mean you must be the world's most stingy person in the world to pass it up for less than a dollar. Overall the album gets like a B+. Bloody Mary and Marry the night are really good.
Just when I thought her last album was jaw dropping this one is edgier and even better!  Thank you Gaga!
This is an amazing album! If you look at the state of pop music today it isn't really good. But this album blows everything out of the water! It's amazing!I loveHeavy Metal LoverElectric ChapelYou and IGovernment HookerandAmericanoThe most. They are all really really original! Give the album a listen.
This CD is like the revolution of pop music. I love how different Lady Gaga is from the rest. She has her own unique sound for each song and has written all of them herself. Way more than you can say for everyone else out there. The tracks on this CD are risky but very likable. Love the dance beats. she is a great entertainer. Maybe not the best album of the year but it is definitely the biggest happening in Gaga's career. I'd have to say my favorite song is Schiebe. :)
I really enjoyed this album compared to the Fame Monster. I felt that album wasn't as good as The Fame itself. I felt that it lacked alot of spunk compared to the first album and was alittle worried that this one wouldas well. Boy was I wrong! This album took me completely by surprised. This has to be one of the best electronic albums this year! Schiebe Judas and Bad Kids are three of my favorite tracks. Bloody Mary and Americano are also good as well. In fact I thought Born This Way was the weakest of the tracks. (Which may have been a smart marketing move!)I felt like she did a great job of picking out producers/ musicians. It reminded me so much of Deadmau5 and some newer Pet Shop Boys type music. She does a great job of mixing in 80s pop with modern rhythmic beats. This album is playing along side Calvin Harris and Goldfrapp's releases from last summer on my mp3 player. I felt like she outdid them both by a longshot. Lady Gaga is really a good student of music and I'm sure she'll have a successful career. One as long as Madonna or any of The Jacksons has yet to be seen. This is defiantly a good album to have if your a fan of pop music. Lady Gaga's really done a great job!
"I admit some of Lady Gaga's songs make you tap your feet or even make you stand up and move a little. However the rest of the album sounds like a very bad workout track.With lyrics made to ""shock and awe"" the world I wish there would be some sustenance to them....there isn't. If you don't care what she says then you should be in pretty good shape. She has about 5 songs with great lyrics/messages (out of 17). I guess she figured if she gave you an album with 100 songs on it you wouldn't take the time to worry about the quality.But heck what are you reading this for? You're still going to buy this album aren't you?Do yourself a favor: Preview the songs first."
"Upon first listen I found myself hitting the forward button on to the next song.  The cd contains songs which are loud on production and offer little in the form of memorable sing-a-long pop lyrics.  This is dissappointing because we associate Gaga with fun danceable sing-a-long hits.  She has suddenly gone Euro-Underground with heavy 80s synths reminescent of Pet Shop Boys The Cure Blue Oyster and a little religious iconography and references ala Madonna.  She even goes worldly on us by singing a chorus in German on ""Scheiss"" and a little bit of Romania-Gypsy-Spanish on ""Americano"".  I struggle to find one song on the disc which will be an instant hit.  Even the lead single ""Born this Way"" has taken some time to grow on listeners merely by the heavy airplay it receives.  And ""Judas"" - while appropriate for an underground club with its driving bassline - is difficult to sing along to.  I think my favorite song is ""Government Hooker"" - it contains a little bit of that Gaga sassiness and would play well in the clubs.All in all I'm afraid Gaga is experimenting here just to experiment and say to the world I've made it and I can do what I want - perhaps at the expense of losing a certain fanbase.  I would compare this CD to what Alanis Morrissette did when she began her experimental phase and lost her fans.  Sometimes fame makes artists experiement too much in the name of ""growing artistically.""  Hopefully the remixes will come out soon and make these songs more radio friendly.I still respect Gaga as an artist and performer and agree she's one of the best out there right now.  I enjoy how she changes the live versions of these songs for performances and often enjoy the live version better.  I guess I'll wait for the next disc!"
"[Update]Amazon.com finally got around to delivering the album.  I am imagining that whoever it was that came up with the ""really popular artist's new album on release day for $0.99"" promotion is probably in some hot water right now.But anyway Amazon's spectacular issues with digital file delivery in this case aside the album itself is decent.  It is in my opinion a love letter to the 1980s specifically to Madonna.  The album screams 1980s in its beats ""synthesizer"" additions and general feel of the music.None of the songs really grabbed me unlike past albums.4 stars (updated from 2 stars from earlier today when I couldn't get hold of the album to properly review it)-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Please see the ""customer image"" I am uploading along with this review.  I went ahead and purchased the album with the Gold Box deal for my girl.  I have my mp3 store settings to put any new songs into my Amazon Cloud drive storage AND to auto-download to my PC.  The auto-download didn't happen.So OK no problem I can just go into the Amazon Cloud Player for the web and select the album and download it manually... um actually no ... I can't.I can't listen to the songs I cannot download them I cannot interact with them.  Only ""Hair"" seems to be available to me right now.  I am going to fire off an e-mail to customer service but I thought I would put a ""head's up"" out there to anyone who might be considering this deal.It is most likely just server load issues and they will get it worked out.  But I (and I imagine you) will be quite irritated if it is some DRM thing or some sort of a ""street date"" thing.  If the album is available for purchase (at whatever price is set for purchase) then if I purchase it I should have immediate and full access to it. Period.I will update this when/if this issue gets worked out or I get more information."
This album is so high energy and upbeat! I also love the different creative ways she sings the lyrics.  I think its the best album I have heard this year so far and I have heard a lot of albums this year! and for only 99 cents the first day for the MP3 album what a bargin!! Go Lady GAGA go! LOVE it!
Let me start off by saying what a huge Lady GaGa fan I am...that being said this has been the biggest waste of money I have spent on an album in a long time. I could have just downloaded two of the singles and been better off. I don't know what the deal is with these songs...they just don't have the same quality as Monster. I don't even want to listen to them...and why so angry? And why all the weird religious references in these songs? Just don't get it. Save yourself some money and just by Born This Way the single and The Edge of Glory.
the worst music from the WORST copycat in musical history. black jesus+amen fashion? LMAO The FASHION of his love? lmao HAIR? LMAO SCHIBE? old techno sounding stuff she ripped off from Human Resource. she doesn't use autotune? yeah right.. hahahaha this is TOTAL junk. crappy cover as well. ugly music from an ugly singer. do not buy. save your money. total waste.
When she first shouted out the the name of this album at the 2010 VMAs everyone knew it would be a hit. It's been a year since the the announcement and she already has four successful singles out. All the other songs on the album are great and the album is a huge hit. She was born this way she was born to be successful.
This is a solid effort by Lady Gaga to put forward an extensive and thorough new album. Overall it is very creative and there is a heavy 80s influence in this album that is still current and different. Most of the album has an up-beat tempo except for a few tracks in the middle. Now that I've listened to it many times I will skip over a few tracks usually - but I prefer this in a 17-track album instead of an 8-track album. There is a good variety and the album showcases her talent ambition and thorough work as an artist. This is a must-buy for music fans!
"Like some of the reviewers I was not wild about the first releases from the album -- I liked the message but did not care for the songs so much.  When I downloaded the album I was underwhelmed with the first listen.  The songs seemed chopping slipping from one style to another in this incoherent mishmash.  Or so I thought at first.  After listening to the album about a dozen times -- it's addictive! -- I have to say I really LOVE it now.  ""Government Hooker"" will be a smash hit.  ""Schiebe"" will be a smash hit.  And neither song sounds like anything she's done before.  ""Hair"" is certainly radio-friendly.  ""Americano"" comes off as this wild Spanish-flavored number that seems to invoke hot-button issues like immigration and gay marriage in a playful way.  The chorus of ""Heavy Metal Lover"" is hummed -- think of Madonna on ""Frozen"" or ""I'll Remember"" but to a mid-tempo song.  Anyway I read somewhere that she plans to release 9 singles from the album and I certainly believe there are enough potential hits on this album for it to stack up quite well against ""The Fame Monster.""  It's a hectic album that is quite production-heavy.  But for me that ended up being the album's greatest strength.  It's quite slick actually...."
"First run through of the album and there certainly are some very different sounds on it.  Can see why some people don't like it - but I think it's great. Can even stomach ""You and I"" even though it's certainly NOT my kind of music."
This is still about a dollar too much but in all honesty I wouldn't pay the electricity or waste the bandwidth to download this.
I bought the mp3 album when it was a $0.99  and loved it. I also ordered the Born This Way Special Edition CD and couldn't be happier. There are so many great songs on this album. I love every single song on this album and the remixes... I love anything Lady Gaga.. Loved every single song and video of hers. Buy This album... So put your paws up because you were BORN THIS WAY BABY....
While Gaga is famous for selling any old 'edition' or 'special' in 10 different packages this was perfect and a great deal! I love spending money on her prettier items like this. I just wish it was bigger but great things come in little packages too.
I PAID FOR THE 99 CENT VERSION AND IT DIDN'T GIVE IT TO ME AT ALL. AMAZON SUCKS AND SO DOES GAGA
"I think I have figured it out. This is actually just a weird performance art piece and the joke is on all of us. The idea was to regurgitate everything bad about 80s and 90s music and see how many people will buy it and actually think it is good and intended to be good just because they love Lady GaGa.  With the Born this Way album we get a few awful 80s style saxophone solos that are cringe inducing at best. On top of that we get a bizarre no reason for it song sung half in German (99 Luft Balloons anyone?). The bad keyboarding reminds me of Tiffany and Debbie Gibson. Now I know Gaga was busy being born when those two were popular but even the teens then knew the music then was awful. And electric guitar solos? I kept thinking this has got to be a joke! To make matters worse there is a cacophony of all the worst 90s techno noises here and there for no apparent reason other than to grate on your nerves and see if you can make it through the song without intentionally ramming your car into a wall. Given her past creativity and overall talent I can't come to any other conclusion than this is all just a joke on all of us. Personally I love The Fame/Monster and actually like the title track and less so Judas. The final indication of her performance art intention is the inclusion of obvious Madonna rip offs including the reworking of ""Express Yourself"" into ""Born this Way"" and all the catholic Jesus Mary Judas references. I mean ""Black Jesus""? Seriously? That is so ""Like a Prayer"" 1989."
"My first thoughts on the album were a little short and narrow-minded so here are my thoughts after a close second listen. I haven't read along with the lyrics and even though there are plenty of political allegories and deeper meanings I'm a ""music first""-kind of guy. Melody and vocals is king if the lyrics are good that's a plus but bad lyrics can't break a good song. Just like with the best metal music what draws me to Gaga's music is the heaviness the tempo and the relentless melody simple as that. I find it sad that people are discussing the quasi-religious aspects to such a degree; if we can't even express ourselves freely through art and music what kind of world do we live in? It does give the music a controversial edge true but I've always loved those kind of overdramatics; epicness color and controversy being bolder and larger than life it just makes for a stronger iconography and mythology which is exactly what made Gaga who she is; the myth and icon.""Marry The Night"" is a great way to set the stage. The song establishes the almost non-stop tempo and is the first that you'll be slaughtering in the shower.""Born This Way"" wants to be a lot better than it is; Gaga wants the whole world to embrace in an anthem of acceptance but the in-your-face subject matter can't hide a rather bland song. It does stick a little bit so passable if only for the catchiness.""Government Hooker"" will divide people; it may come across as the most self-indulgent nonsense ever or an amazing feat of originality and art. It's actually pretty good if a little bit annoying. One of the only songs that is neither sledgehammering nor entirely slow. Half-decent.""Judas"" is ""Bad Romance"" done again only faster and better; the way Gaga builds a dark heavy pounding structure and then soars above it with her vocals is so amazingly infectious and I've never heard anything like her wonderful wailing. Fantastic.""Americano"" is hilarious but also freakishly original had Britney Spears attempted anything like this she would've been kicked out of Mexico in a heartbeat. Gaga nicely balances humor and musicality making for a somewhat decent song at least it's one of the album's few brighter moments.""Hair"" isn't too bad but there's nothing radical going on here. Steady beat a love for follicles (ironic coming from someone who mainly wears wigs) good times. My favourite part is the ""stuttering"" but Gaga's known for that and she's done it way better in other songs. Good.""Schei&szlig;e"" is uhm...no musical highlight let's just put it that way. Gaga throws together nonsense-German in a speaking manner the result is underwhelming maybe a little bit funny if you don't hail from Germany.""Bloody Mary"" is another highlight. A slow and very dark (musically and lyrically) dance-ballad with Gaga's haunting vocals and all-out bloodcurling screams. Very inviting great change of pace absolutely memorable. Awesome.""Black Jesus  Amen Fashion"" is the song that always passes me by; almost the entire song can pass before I realize it's started playing. That's not a compliment to any music but the song doesn't strike me as particularly ""bad"" either though it just doesn't reach out and grab you by the ears.""Bad Kids"" sounds a bit off for me sort of merging the dark and light suddenly becoming a little ""jolly"" in the chorus which doesn't cut it for me. Weak.""Fashion Of His Love"" is a song I'd describe as ""cute"". One of the lighter jollier little gems of the album it might just stick in your head as well. The rhytmic percussion is a little much (a little too ""present"") but the joyfulness in Gaga's voice makes up for it. Good!""Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)"" is probably the weakest on the entire album. It always strikes me as a mishmash of tempos and ideas that don't gel; the overblown epicness of ""Marry The Night"" and ""The Edge Of Glory"" combined with weird breakdowns and the typical Gaga-repeating. Keyboards and drums fight for sonic space making this song sound like a bad overblown mixture of all the better songs on the album. Bad.""Heavy Metal Lover"" isn't very heavy metal at all; it's a heavy dance/techno-grind with spoken and electronically skewed verses blooming into a wonderful ""ooh""-melody. It doesn't take much to make a memorable track and this is definitely one of the better ones. Very solid.""Electric Chapel"" is actually the most ""metal"" song on the album it opens with a gripping heavy metal-guitar melody and builds into a steady thumping rock/dance track which is equally subtle and hypnotic. The ""du doo doo"" melody is unbeatable; simple but undeniable and followed by a guitar solo it makes this the album's absolute highlight. Short but oh so very sweet.""The Queen"" is the companion to ""Born This Way"" another joyful up-tempo track that might put a smile on all kinds of queens' faces (take that anyway you please) but it's nothing for me. Bland forgettable and with an odd tempo-shift. There's a little more soft guitar going on in this one though which is the only saving grace.""Yo&uuml; And I"" opens sounding almost beat for beat like ""Speechless"" but suddenly it adds a slowed-down version of the drum/clap from ""We Will Rock You"" so it's just a little bit heavier than most power-ballads. It's a little bit better than ""Speechless"" too the overall melody isn't as ""pop"" and it works well with just piano and vocals as well. Decent.""The Edge Of Glory"" will probably go down as one of the most memorable singles from the album it's an unapologetic rock anthem disguised with dance-beats. An epic victorious song for graduating students drunk graduating students skydivers and graduating skydivers. Clarence Clemons closes the album with his saxophone bridging the gap between dance and rock old and new beginning and end. Very good.There's also a bonus disc with remixes they are as follows.""Born This Way (Country Road Version)"" is exactly what it sounds like; if Gaga's vocals were merged with some mellow Bon Jovi this is what it might end up sounding like. I don't think it's the ideal song for a country-rendition (the chorus is far too grand) but it's really nice to hear a slightly different vocalization by Gaga in the verses. Decent.""Judas (DJ White Shadow Remix)"" is the shortest of the remixes; it's what I like to call ""zipper-techno"" (technically electro house) the sound Benny Benassi is most famous for. Pretty epic nevertheless far from the worst remix I've heard. Good.""Marry The Night (Zedd Remix)"" sounds like a giant bass bumblebee (more electro house?) fighting a mosquito who fires beeping lasers. Weak.""Schei&szlig;e (DJ White Shadow Mugler)"" goes on for nearly ten minutes and sounds almost exactly like the previous track except with Gaga's fake German interspersed. The horror.""Fashion Of His Love (Fernando Garibay Remix)"" dispenses of the odd percussion and provides a much cleaner and more straightforward take on the song. Good.""Born This Way (Jost & Naaf Remix)"" chops the chorus into pieces and mixes it into a crescending keyboard battle. Half-decent.Overall Gaga's taken her music to a darker and far odder place than the shallow hits on ""The Fame"" but she's also building on the legendary foundation set with ""The Fame Monster"" it's just too bad she goes so far it almost ends up sounding like parody at times. There is fierce originality here and overall it's an album that shouldn't be missed but most of the songs never make the extra leap from ""passable"" or ""very good"" into ""new territory"" or lack that extra bit of hypnosis or intensity. A weak four out of five is my final grade. Gaga's without a doubt the most compelling and interesting artist in the mainstream world today but if she only dared to make a cohesively dark and intimate dance-rock-opera (and dispensed with the silliness) she'd make history by transgression."
So I have been spending a lot of time with this album over the past week. I checked out the tracks a weak early with the leak as well. I was initially a bit underwhelmed. I thought it was too straight forward bland and I didn't like that it's target audience seemed to be a younger crowd as opposed to the club scene and partying....But after spending some time with it this album really is making a greatly positive impression on me. I have high respects for GaGa really making this HER album as opposed to a bunch of producers writing her songs and telling her what to sing about. This woman is a real music artist whose work evolves reflects and is influenced by current culture and herself. You don't see that often in pop culture ESPECIALLY with the super stars. Sometimes I forget that you need to just strap yourself in  see where the artist takes you and enjoy the journey. It's a huge departure from her current album but how boring would it be if we stayed in the same place forever?Anyways songs like Americano Heavy Metal Lover and Fashion of his Love were initially turn offs for me but I am finding myself falling in love with them and consistently humming the melodies around the house. She's exploring a lot of territory within many genres of music and I feel she's doing it with incredible style and boldness.With all that being said I am very VERY happy with this album regardless of the slightly sour beginning I had with it.I really love it.
"It's hard to argue with a 99 cent album but I can't rate this as more than average.First note that this version of the album has fewer songs than are included in some of the CD versions (or in the version at iTunes). That's a shame because the alternative version of ""Born This Way"" not included here is worth a listen.Second there's the music. It's reasonably well-produced and not offensively bad but for the most part it's derivative ""dance"" music that was already old when Madonna did it a decade ago. The best of these tracks is ""Bloody Mary"" which sounds like a cross between Madonna and Debbie Harry; at least it made me feel that I'd got my 99 cents worth. ""Yo&uuml; and I"" is a departure stylistically though and Lady Gaga turns in credible mainstream rock performance.Third--and speaking of ""Yo&uuml; and I""--there's the lyrics. The superfluous umlaut in the title of ""Yo&uuml; and I"" is confusing enough but the phrase itself is also ungrammatical in context. As if to prove that the poor grammar is no accident the next song (""The Edge of Glory"") includes ""you and me"" where ""you and I"" would in fact be proper. But given rampant illiteracy among pop stars that's a mere quibble. What's worse is that Lady Gaga seems to be trying so very hard to be ""deep"" but comes off instead sounding like legions of college sophomores who discovered the thrills of political engagement and nonconformity during freshman year. Pop music can certainly be poetic but let's just say that she's no Paul Simon--and for that matter she's no Madonna.Lady Gaga is never going to be my favorite artist but I did find more to like on earlier albums where she stuck to making fun dance music than on this ambitious-but-flawed effort."
Know before you buy: This IS the edited version.This album is fantastic! Well the 11 songs that I have been able to download from Amazon are fantastic anyway.  Still waiting for the remaining 3 but I'm enjoying these in the mean time.  Can't believe it was really only $.99.  For that price I'm willing to wait until the Amazon servers clear up before delievering the rest of the album to me.
Great album especially for .99 cents. saw Lady Gaga at Lollapalooza last year and she was just a brilliant performer. still would buy this album even on a regular price. Thanks amazon or Lady Gaga for a great deal which is quite rare these days.
"Gaga has proven she is no flash in the pan! Another great accomplishment! Saw her perform ""Born This Way"" in concert so I knew what to expect from the title track but the rest of the CD was also very good!  Also Amazon is a great venue for ordering things of this nature! First rate!"
It takes a few listens to really realize how amazing this album is and STILL two years later I can play this album in its' entirety and it never gets old.  Awesome album by an awesome artist.
When you get a highly-anticipated product almost for free people are going to line up to be first for it.  I'm curious to see how many digital units this incredible deal has sold when the final tally comes in for the 99 cents deal.  It took hours but I got all 14 tracks + the booklet.  As much as I dislike the idea of the seller (Amazon) editing comments in this case they should; let people's reviews of the product stay but complaints about tech issues/delays should be removed.
I see reviews all over the place for this album. The ones that do not shock me at solid 3-stars and an overall 4-star ratings.  The 1 and 2 star reviews are outliers in that these reviewers likely have negative dispositions with her and the genre of music.  Yes she is brilliant and hard working and YES she caters to pop culture! Why not?  Let's face it those 5-star albums out there are usually boring.  Not all but most. The ultimate goal is to make money and if your album is boring...well no moola from fans. So I give her a solid 4-star rating on this album since most of the songs are catchy.
"This album is definitely one of Gaga's best. She's gone from bubblegum pop to hard edgy rock infused pop. Gaga is definitely kicking butt and taking names. She wants to showcase her music skills in ways that many artist are scared to venture in. ""Born This Way"" has few filler tracks which venture into new styes of music that only indie musicians would dare experiment with. If you haven't gotten into Gaga yet then I'd suggest Born This Way as a must buy album. You'll like at least ONE song from the album. It's worth every penny."
I know it's probably a crime punishable by the RIAA but this album is so very and totally over-rated. Musically not that interesting or stimulating. Somebody got paid off big time to promote this music.  I miss the days of locally owned radio stations that could play what they wanted.
This is one of the best albums I have ever heard.  It's a big step up for Lady Gaga.  This album is great to listen to while chilling out.  It's even better for dancing.  I can't help but dance and sing along when listening to this album!  It is definately worth the money.
I love that about her.  She is soRaw and talented.  I love different.  And Lady Gaga is very different.
"I am a huge fan of Gaga; I have been since The Fame. Not only is she quite creative and very talented but she's iconic in the way that Madonna was decades ago. She's taking a stand for social progress and inspiring people who feel like ""freaks"" (or monsters LOL) to find their true colors and stick to them. Some people seem to feel that she's ""trying too hard."" I can see what they mean but I can also see how difficult it is to be in the limelight all the time trying to make a positive difference but needing to work on her career as well. I think that Gaga is doing the best she can; she's only human after all. I personally loved Born This Way the song when it came out. It had such a positive life-affirming message and was quite catchy as well. It was refreshing to experience the happy soulful side of Gaga after the darkness of the Telephone video and such (a video I really liked by the way.) I knew that many people would dislike the song as it is for a certain taste.It is refreshing and appropriate for the times to have a superstar who is such an advocate for diversity and acceptance. Lady Gaga may not be perfect but she's awesome in my opinion. She is her own person as well as her own artist that's for sure.As for the music:  While Born This Way is not as strong of an album as the brilliant The Fame Monster it's still very good. I like it just as much as the quirky-pop of The Fame although they're very different from each other. BTW is experimental creative funky and appealingly non-commercial compared to the Fame (even though I do enjoy commercial-pop).  The lyrics are clever and often inspirational. My fav tracks are Marry The Night Born This Way Judas Electric Chapel (my fav song on the album; so haunting and wonderful) and You and I. But I loved the album as a whole; it all flows together and is  moody (not as in depressing but more that it sets a certain energy/mood) very stylish and even a little punk-ish.Lady Gaga is def. one of the strongest pop artists around these days. She has brains beauty a quirky charm talent and is a breath of fresh air after the swarm of all-the-same female pop superstars  that have surfaced in the past ten years. I hope Gaga continues to make great music and to be the true artist she is - someone who takes creativity and artistry to a whole new level even to the point of fashion statements!"
"Let me start by saying that i fully intended this to be a negative review of this CD. But it turns out after finally getting the whole thing I just cant call the Cd ""good"" or ""bad"" or I can call it both at the same time. I love it or hate it depending on what part is playing. I believe the bad is due to Gaga just trying too hard. A lot of the songs are downgraded due to things put in that just did'nt need to be there. My 12th grade English teacher once told me ""It's what you leave out of a story that makes is great"". I think Gaga needs to apply that to her music this time around. The amazing thing about this CD is every single low rated song had the potential to be a an epic 5/5.Marry the Night 2.5/5 Starts out good but then goes off in the wrong direction like many of the songs on this CD.Born This Way 5/5 Not sure how anybody dislikes this song about freedom and being yourself. Its not inherently a ""Gay Anthem"" and I'm not sure why people view it as such.Government Hooker 5/5 Love it. Dirty. Raunchy. Just the way i like it. Cant wait to get the UNCENSORED VERSION.Judas 5/5 Love it when she mixes religious symbolism in her songs. I know a lot of people don't but I do. The bridge is awesome. Awesome music video.Looks good so far. But here is where things take a turn for the worst to make an understatement.Americano: 1/5 I am going to pretend this song does not exist. Over the top is an understatement Gaga trying to hard. The last 30 seconds is good though. Anything before that is horrible.Hair 0/5 Corny lyrics. I am as free as my hair? I am my hair? Really gaga? Really? I understand the sentimental value this song has for Gaga but i found it uninspiring. Sorry.Sheibfie 2/5 Starts out EPIC and then the chorus comes to let you down. Yet another song with good parts and horrible parts. Better than Hair and Americano though. Remixes will be better than the album version. Basically.. what they take out.Bloody Mary 5/5 Best song of the CD. Love the religious symbolism once again. Love the synthesized sound effects and the beat. Deep spiritual lyrics. Ironically based on what I read this song was a spur of the moment fluke.Bad Kids: 2.5/5 The yelling at the beginning was unnecessary. Lyrics sound like it was written for a rebellious 12 year old. Musically it sounds ok.Highway Unicorn: 2/5 Just plain bad. Song is a chaotic mess. Some of the mess does sound good though if you can bear getting through it.Heavy Metal Lover: 4/5 A good upbeat yet mellow song. Good for cruising. Smooth structure and lyrics.Electric Chapel: 3/5 At risk of repeating myself (again) Good and bad at the same time. Driving me insane at this point.You and I: 5/5 I honestly did not think I would like this song but the direction taken was surprising. It is not her singing it on the piano which is what I expected. The song needed reinvented due to it being sang on tour for so long and it was successfully done.Edge of Glory. 2/5 I would have liked it better with less singing and more techno sounds or being a pure techno song. How did we get from house music to a saxophone? Meh. The pure techno remixes are far superior. Overkill with the strings at the end.Overall i think the CD is worth buying. But i certainly suggest sampling it before you hear it. Its most certainly different.  Reviews are going to be very polarizing even for Gaga fans like myself."
I was really excited when this came out.  I was hooked on Hair Schiebe and Edge of Glory!  The style was good but there were some songs that didn't line up well for me.  You and I was a bit too countryish for me.  There were plenty of songs to listen to that were really interesting like Bloody Mary but that one song still trips me up.  Over all I still love the Fame Monster the best but I'll give Born This Way an 8/10! :)By Ishyama
Takes a minute to let it all soak in. But overall I really like the new album. Lady Gaga is a very talented musician who's always pushing the limits and isn't afraid to take a chance.
I would love to listen to this album I ordered 10 hours ago but it still hasn't downloaded and I have yet to listen to it.Add to this that Amazon has yet to reach out to the affected buyers.Amazon if you don't have the infrastructure to support the high demand a deal like this creates then don't offer the deal.  I'll think twice before purchasing music from you again.This entire situation has been a total customer service failure.
If you are going to offer a special it would be nice if it was delivered. Yes it was only 99 cents but how many customer's 99 cents were collected and still have not received the download. Try contacting Amazon it's impossible. I would suggest to any one else who has not received the download to write your local authorities. Maybe it would prompt Amazon to put up a real contact point.
I never seen so many of her videos (like Die Young) that has nothing but Anti-Christ and Illuminati symbolism in them. I thought Kesha and Mondana was bad. If you don't catch it then your being programmed.
Awesome album you won't get enough buy it now. Can't wait for the tour.  Lady gaga at her best so far.
So glad I decided to download for .99 (really? Wow!.) Not a bad song on the list. Couple of faves already. You probably got more change in your car ash tray. Buy it!
"For all of the hype and shameless self promotion by Gaga this album fails to deliver. All of the interviews where she claimed it was ""genius"" just indicate that she's very deluded. I really tried to like this album listening all the way through five times. It's terrible. At best it's Europop-trash. At its worst it's derivative of everything from Madonna to Depeche Mode. Nothing on this album is original and the lyrics are forced and kind of stupid even by Gaga standards. ""Put your hands on me...John F Kennedy"" - seriously? The only song that isn't a complete failure is ""You and I"" a Gaga ""ballad"" and I say that because at least the song's lyrics and feeling seem to be genuine and not crafted to hook the idiot masses. This album isn't even worth the 99 cents I paid for it."
"Born This Way is an odd record that blends elements of dance music gothic pop arena rock and even a touch of metal but never fully inhabits any of those genres. It's Lady Gaga's way of announcing she was born to be a loud garish genre-bending machine and her Little Monsters were (hopefully) born to ride beside her. Where image means as much as sound the purposely tacky cover art confirms this statement. She's neither as Bruce Springsteen nor as Whitney Houston as she may claim to be but she's certainly a unique pop personality who nearly converts appropriation into originality. Could another modern pop star give us an album where feel-good anthems like ""The Edge of Glory"" and ""Hair"" sit nicely among weird club forays like ""Scheisse"" and ""Government Hooker?"" Although the standard edition clocks in at just over an hour barely longer than The Fame it feels much longer because this is a record that is defined by its relentlessness. In an era where hype means more than music Born This Way is still one of the most interesting albums and Lady Gaga continues to grow more interesting as she inhabits fame."
This was a christmas present for someone.  I personally dont listen to this artist but it is nice to see vinyl records are still popular.  I have no complaints.  It shipped in a well protected box and arrived quickly.
Classic GaGa with the perfect songs! These are most of the ones that you want anyway! Chart Topper songs all in one place!
"I wasn't sure if I was going to purchase this album based on the singles I've heard on the radio but when Amazon had it on sale for $.99 I figured why not?...Then I listened to it and figured out why it was on sale for $.99 on it's release date.Nearly every track on Born this Way makes the weakest tracks on the Fame Monster look like masterpieces. There's nothing that even comes close to Just Dance Pokerface Bad Romance Telephone...etc.The Best Tracks (Best not to be confused with all that good):""Born this Way"" - Catchy although it's a pretty blatent rip-off of 1980's Madonna.""Heavy Metal Lover""""Electric Chapel""The Average Tracks:""Judas"" - this reminds me of a crappy remake of ""Bad Romance""...without the lyrical ingenuity of the original.The Boring Tracks:""Marry the Night""""Hair""""Bad Kids"" - What's with the weird 80's throwback vibe anyhow?""Highway Unicorn""""You and I""""Edge of Glory""The Seriously? Tracks:""Government Hooker"" - I hope this is the worst song of her career because I'm not sure I could take any worse.""Americano"" - Is this supposed to sound Latin? Italian? Cause all I hear is stupid.""ScheiBe"" - The English part is almost catchy. The German rapping(?) makes my ears bleed.""Bloody Mary"" - It was a tough choice between Boring or Seriously?...it qualifies as both.We get it Gaga - you're all into self-empowerment and the 1980's on this record. The problem is you aren't particularly good at writing songs in those themes.Overall verdict: If you spent $1.99 or less on this album you're probably not too disappointed. You probably have that much change in your sofa afterall. I would NOT recommend spending any more - it's called buyers remorse for a reason!"
Like Lady Gaga's music and this was an interesting album to listen to while driving on my daily paper route.
OK the songs are catchy and rich with meaning and depth but I think some Gaga fans are going to be just a little disappointed.  The songs on the album don't have the same level of elegance or catchiness as her previous works.Now I get it that an artist evolves and moves on and that fans just can't keep on expecting new derivations of prior hits.  And it's not like her songs lack substance or are devoid of artistic meaning.  However the songs don't rise up to the same level of melodic and harmonic excellence of what she's done in the past.The songs certainly pleasant to listen to but these songs won't be the first pick on the karaoke machine.
It has taken me ALL day to download this album. I understand its due to the mass volume of everybody trying to download it at the same time. But seriously if you are going to have this type of deal you should be prepared for mass volume it produces.  Had to purchase this album twice so I hope that I am not charged twice either.  Tried to download in cloud no such luck so finally got it to go in the mp3 downloader which I prefer in the first place. Looking forward to listening to the album...some day if it ever downloads.
Love this cd.  Great song selection.  Listen to it often.  Downloaded right into itunes and I can listen to it on my computer whenever I want
I was not remotely a fan of Lady Gaga's - in fact when she started getting very broad publicity I hardly took note.  But there she was --- EVERYWHERE!  I was hearing songs that I thought were fun exuberating only to discover it was Lady Gaga.  I had sworn I'd never buy into a trending new musical artist (unless I could compair them to one of my favorites from yesteryear) but Lady G changed my mind.  I am happy to have her latest CD joining the 500-plus that I already have not to mention the vinyl I started collecting as a kid.  Yes Lady Gaga is sharp talented and COOL.  Gotta love her! Hey Lady Gaga why not come out on vinyl?? There are so many of us who prefer it and it would be a SO cool thing to do!  I can see you make it happen - vinyl rules!!!
I only got the booklet and two songs Marry the Night and Schei&szlig;e. They're both pretty fun songs and if they're any indicator of what the whole album is like it feels very much like a dance album. She's bringing back some old beats and musical styles and I think she's doing it well. I don't know if this album is quite 5-star worthy but at least this will offset the 1-star ones.I imagine Amazon decided to take a loss on these sales in hopes of promoting their cloud player and digital music. Unfortunately for them these issues just seemed to make a lot of people angry. I've bought digital downloads before and used the cloud player. I've never had a problem and I really like the features. I figure with the large amount of people downloading there are bound to be issues and it'll take a day or so to fix. The way I see it I only paid $.99 so it's not like I didn't get my money's worth with only two songs. Haha. Really though hat's off to Amazon for making this available for customers for so cheap. I was on the fence about whether or not I wanted the album this is at least a nice way to test drive it. Here's to hoping I get the rest of the songs fixed soon!
I'm a Lady Gaga fan but wasn't that thrilled with this CD as I was her first CD - however for those die-hard fans still recommend adding this to your collection
purchased this... but struggling with being able to download the items... I work in the IT dept at my work and it isn't an issue on my end....
I do really enjoy the Collection CD's that I got in the mail. I am a huge fan of gaga and I lov eher so much. I just didn't like the casing with this package. Why cardboard? Or-whatever this is. It's going to tear by the time I start to acutally want to use it. -.-
I like many others have been woting for this cd for a very long time. It is simply amazing a little darker that your usual Gaga but Mother Monster can do no wrong in my eyes! I LOVE IT!!!!!!
Born This Way has to be one of the most moving albums I've listened to in a long time. You begin the journey with Marry The Night the song always reminds me of an epic awakening to the inner spirit. Then you descent into Government Hooker which takes over your body with it's sick dance beats. From there we learn about how we were all BORN THIS WAY!!! :D The album continues through gaga's muse of life love and liberty. My favorite songs from the album are: Bloody Mary and Black Jesus Amen Fashion. 10/10 AMAZING ALBUM!!!!!!
I love Lady Gaga and this album is great! I like that I can go back and listen to it whenever and I could download to my computer
Not worth it...pay the 15 dollars on itunes and get the whole album.  I like Lady Gaga but what a horrible way to promote your music.  You only get a few of the songs.  This is mentioned nowhere and if you want to download them to itunes which probably the entire world does then you have to spend an hour navigating amazon's horrible software.  Amazon should stick to selling books because it is failing horribly at selling music and isn't ever going to compete with itunes.There is a simple formula for success that amazon lacks...I pay money I get music INSTANTLY...not I pay money then get jerked around for an hour trying to figure out Amazon's software and the reason why I only got 6 of the 14 songs. Note to buyers after that hour you will not get the remaining songs that are missing which are all of her hits.  I'd give it back if I could. Bottom line I will never use amazon mp3 to buy another album so long as I live...worst experience of my life.
Full albums typically release on Tuesdays. Stop complaining that you are going to get the full album tomorrow for $0.99.
Yes when the Lady herself provoked the thought that Alexander Mcqueen was looking down on her pulling her strings of artistry - she wasn't kidding.Every song is a an ocean expanded on something so common place or trivial that is amplified to be thought provoking and thirst-quenching. In an industry of bland personalities poor dance style and terrible music - This one DELIVERS !!!I cant explain enough that the album is not a running theme thats recycled throughout with different measures of the beat. rather each song is a shock to the ears something different something new that skews to directions you cant predict.All I can say gagaloo is Mcqueen would be proud. and I know that means a lot to her and many people.
"First I'm not a big fan of lady GaGa. Im not a big fan of ""pop"" music at all. But... for $0.99 I'll give anything a try.I see that Lady GaGa is credited with composing one track on the album; is that correct? We should say that producers are the real artists and the performer is merely another instrument at their disposal. That's true of so many pop artists. It's not unique to GaGa by any means.So here you are .... the production value is very good. The loops and beats are flawless. Sadly I didn't really enjoy any of songs but this is matter of personal taste not a reflection of the artist.This album really reminds of Madonna. ""Born This Way"" actually borders on plagiarism It sounds eerily similar to ""Express Yourself"". The lack of originality is my biggest complaint.Now: Stop bashing Amazon. Geez you got a new release from a popular artist for less than a buck. I personally had no problems downloading album. On the rare occurrence that a download was sluggish or stalled altogether Amazon corrected it for me no questions asked.Sure Amazon learned something about their capacity. I'm confident in the future things will be even better. I don't buy anything from Apple anymore but I do recall a number of failed downloads; some they comped me for and for others I was just out of luck.strengths:good production valueinfectious beats tight groove on most trackswider subject matter - more variety than previous releaseGreat value at $0.99weakness:totally unoriginalmore about shock value than musical credibilityalbum is somewhat of a reflection of a narcissistic personality"
I purchased this on Monday when the had the 99 deal then too!  First I must say that I was planning on purchasing this album before I knew it was on super sale but getting it for less than a buck was awesome!  On a side note I had absolutely no problems downloading it - it took as long as any other full albums I purchase take (about 15 minutes or so) so I'm not sure what everyone else's problems were...Anyway to review the product (which I agree with others - reviews here should be about the product NOT issues with Amazon and/or your computer/operating system/internet connection problems).  I LOVE THIS ALBUM!  I loved Fame Monster but I think this one is better than Fame Monster in my book.  A lot of people have complained about the 80's/techno beats to the song and I think maybe that's why I love it so much.  Gaga has a great voice and writes pretty damn good songs.  This album will be on repeat for the next few weeks for me!
Lady Gaga is trying too hard. This whole rebellion thing she has going on it's too much. And a revolutionary anthem of self-love and world peace based on God? It's a little incredulous. No good comes from Religion Lady Gaga. Just war hatred bigotry and recism. Try again.
But it's still a ton of fun to listen to! This album has a lot of unique tracks all with different-sounding songs. It's a lot of fun to sing along to in the car but it doesn't have the same dance-feel as her previous albums.
This album is for Lady Gaga fans. (Or her little monsters if you prefer.) If you're not a fan don't bother. You don't like her or her music now so you won't like this. Personally I think this is even better than her first album. I love Lady Gaga and her music speaks to me. So happy I finally got this album!!
I was very excited to see that I could buy Lady Gaga's new album today for 99 cents. However like many others I was only able to download 2 songs at first and when I refreshed I had 4 songs.  I hope that this will be fixed soon.
"After three listens through the whole CD I was hooked. There is so much FUN to this music. Is it the most epic music? No. She is a fairly new recording artist. She has not been around as long as Madonna. For making so much in so little time she has skills and more than that a message: Accept each other.That is her controversy not her music. yet here is the beauty of the criticism she is receiving. In her own words she is ""being compared to legends."" Why isn't it more epic? Wait- you just expected it to be epic. That says something. That says alot.What do we expect of Britney Spears? Another hit! What do we expect of Katy Perry? Another hit?What do we expect of Lady Gaga? Revolutionize pop music and our culture.Wow. That itself is her great impact. And shows no matte what people will always connect the most with authenticity and individualism. They will always critique the greatest the most. Yet those who just give hits and not true artistry we expect that. How we settle on product versus art.The cover of  Born this Way: She is a feminist with activist agendas taking her Little Monsters on the ride of their life. She is not another objectified female. She is beating that system as well.But I'm not here to glorify Lady Gaga. There are some racial insensitivities on this album: ""chola"" and ""orient-made"". She gets dirty in the song ""Heavy Metal Lover."" Speaks of dirtiness in political history past with the song ""Government Hooker."" Her songs sounds similar to others just rehashed. She herself has quoted ""A good artist copies. A great artist steals."" Meaning- she wants to be like her influends but her own version of it all. Personally I consider that the melodies are different so it is not stealing.Gay Rights- she is a big advocate. In Born this Way she makes that loud and clear. I just think of how many ""bigots"" may listen to this song and have their minds changed. How many people decide to become brave and step out of the closet. How people decide on the stance that being gay is something that they were born as and not made into through corruption. How many people will decide that religious institutions can be oppressive and that is not how Lady Gaga views God on any day ""God makes no mistakes...I'm on the right track baby I was born to be brave.""She even sympathizes with the bad kids in her song ""Bad Kids."" I take it as the runaways the homeless the angry kids...the key is that she does not judges. Yet many will argue that she condones bad behavior. Still if we learn to stop judging HER we may come farther as human beings ourselves. After all this only art remember? She has the freedom of speech remember? She can say what she wants. Yes she is singing it. And some people need to hear it. Those who get offended can simply wear an ""ear condom."" It's that simple.This took me back to my high school days of listening to Meatloaf on the school bus and thinking ""this is totally epic but nobody gets it anymore."" She gets it. She's a rockstar disguised through pop. That is the genius. She is meant to be bad. She was born that way.She's a message song writer but she does not sugercoat or come off as all ""good."" That is her appeal. And it works for her. It works for this album too. That's why I gave it five stars.Oh and Marry the Night = pure awesomeness. Through all her messages she reminds us to ""Just Dance"" and to ""find our Jesus in the music"" even when we are ""Dancing in the Dark"" and despite any  ""Bad Romance"" that comes our way it is like how ""Judas"" betrayed ""Jesus""- a darkness that occured so that the person betrayed could become what they were born to be= brave. And no matter what ""poker face"" we show the world or how much we worship pop songs and ""Paparazzi"" there is a ""Heavy metal lover"" in all of us that just needs to recognize freedom and fight until the end or ""Edge of Glory.""-Sarah Browne :)"
I think this album is more RAW Gaga. Think stripped down Fame/Fame Monster. I enjoy her music because I enjoy that she is different. I don't actually like POP music ( my favorite bands are Nine Inch Nails and Tori Amos) but adore Lady Gaga. I know I will grow to love this album more and more as time goes on.
I wasn't even planning on buying this album right away but $.99? Thanks Amazon. And thank you Lady Gaga for being amazing.
Great album! It's too bad that people are giving it lower ratings due to downloading issues not based on the quality of the music. Take a listen -- you won't be able to keep from dancing!
I pre-ordered this album when it first became available. I did not know that I was pre-ordering an album that was incomplete. Three songs are missing. Black Jesus Fashion of His Love and The Queen were not on my album. There were 14 tracks instead of the 17. I feel ripped off.
"This Lady Gaga collection is perfect You get the ""Born this Way"" 22 track deluxe edition CD this CD is the edited version just like the solo CD you would buy so there's no difference between the two. You also get the Remixes CD which is awesome and the HBO special of the Monster Ball at Madison Square Garden all put into one packaged collection. I think this is the best value by far. The collection is made of cardboard some people like it some don't it works for me because I wanted to buy a compilation of Gaga all into one and this is ""IT"" I give this product a strong 5 stars because this collection is exactly what I was looking for and the price point is great too. Enjoy!"
"It's not ""The Fame part 2"" it's an evolution.Many 10/10 moments more consistent than her previous work... A lot of 80's and 90's influences Gaga uses different styles and shows new sides to her voice.It's dark and fun at the same time. Best pop record of the year (at least so far)."
I got the .99 version of the album and purchased the 3 songs that aren't on the regular edition. only for those 3 songs not to download! great from the songs i've heard so far though!
"After a full night's download I have all of the songs - I almost wish there were a few left to dl that may actually be good.  This album is NOT GOOD - juvenile high-school poetry lyrics...droning music...seems she could have created SO much more.  Maybe her illusion has outshone her talent.  She has become very over-exposed for someone with limited creativity.  I'd like to hear some decent music - perhaps she should focus on that and not her ""image""."
Bought the album.  Six of the tracks appeared in my Cloud Drive music collection within a minute.  After more than 8 hours the others still aren't available to me even for download.  Recommend not buying with the Cloud Drive option!
I preordered this months ahead of time and eagerly listened to each song she released leading up to the cd's release. I must say I don't find myself disappointed. At first a few of the songs didn't stick with me. But I'm glad for this. With 17 songs I would have gone crazy if I loved them all at once. I'm one of those people that gets obsessed over songs and can't stop listening to them. I found myself obsessing over 4 or 5 songs at a time perfect for my work commute. And overdoing 4 or 5 songs at a time got me nicely through the cd really getting to see how each song was better for different moods and eventually loving the whole thing. I have found myself loving every track on every Gaga cd and this cd doesn't break that streak.
When I first listened to the CD the whole way through  I was dissappointed.  Then I kept listening and started loving every song. It's a lot different than the the fame monster but it's still really good.  Although a couple of the tracks feel way too much like madonna.
"I am so very dishearted and saddened to listen to this CD. As a fan of Gaga from way back I absolutely adored her last album The Fame Monster. It was creative fun and showed so much heart.This CD is such trash that I can't believe it came from her. There is nothing special or relatable here folks; just a lot of noise and sensationalism just for the sake of being shocking (news flash - they're not shocking at all). The lyrics are boring (nothing I can really feel connected to). Even the song titles are inanely ridiculous! There is maybe one other radio-appropriate tune (aside from the ones already released). The rest sound like European underground songs that may be played at some dank dark club in the basement of a building in the Czech Republic. Lastly and possibly most importantly there are at least 3 songs you can tell the music was taken directly from the songs of other artists. Any originality she had appears to be gone.If her career can withstand this awful awful album I hope she can find her way back to the songs that made her the name she is. Unfortunately this just isn't it. It's hard to believe that this is from the same artist that brought us the incredible ""Speechless"" & ""Teeth"".Needless to say I won't be buying this CD or listening to any of the tracks again. I had given Fame Monster a 5 out of 5. Born This Way gets a 1... out of 5."
Because of the overwhelming demand for this brand new popular album priced at $0.99 Amazon is having trouble keeping its servers from overloading.  This is not the fault of Lady Gaga.  People are rating this album with one star because of technical issues.Please be patient.  You will get your ridiculously cheap album. Be happy such a deal was up for grabs and save your whining for something that warrants it.
99 cents isn't much to lose and it downloaded to my itunes and transferred to my iphone in 10 mins.  This was at 9:15 pst so well after the well documented issues.
"I bought ""Born This Way"" on the day it came out after I got off of work listened to the entire CD on the road back home and felt overwhelmed. I had enjoyed the music but I knew I hadn't yet experienced the album. So finally after digesting everything that ""Born This Way"" has to offer through multiple listens I declare it an epic experience that is easily Lady Gaga's best output thus far.With 17 complex and multi-layered songs that touch on many subjects such as love death self expression self confidence and empowerment sexuality fashion and religion this album proves that Lady Gaga is in a league of her own in todays pop world. Not many can touch what this woman has to offer. With ""Born This Way"" there's a huge and edgy sound(curtesy of RedOne DJ White Shadow and Fernando Garibay) enveloping gritty and clever words that together reek of Gaga and it smells like a confident and unique monster with the attitude of Metal and it cannot be confined.There's the obvious Madonna influences(who I am a huge fan of) on 'SchieBe'(Erotica-era breathy monologue) and 'Fashion of His Love'('Dress You Up') while 'You and I' is reminiscent of Elton John and Queen. I am a huge fan of Bruce Springsteen and The E Street Band so I love the fact that Clarence Clemons plays sax on 'Hair' and 'The Edge of Glory'.Overall ""Born This Way"" holds a lifestyle of it's own. One that I can live only through this album. A sort of New York nightlife of black leather motorcycles raunchy love and wildly colorful hair...a 5 STAR good time!"
This CD Gaga seems to use up of her talent and more common songs than the others. I do like 2-3 songs. But most of the are not exciting. The previous works are much better.
"What a disappointing follow-up album to the Fame and the Fame Monster.  There is nothing on this album that is original unique or catchy like on the Fame.  Reasons why I think it chokes:1. Write some lyrics rather than repeating the same words over and over2. Stop ripping off other people's songs.  One sounds like Britney's ""Gimme More"" and another sounds like the chorus of ""Shout at the Devil"" by Motley Crue.  ""You and I"" sounds like a rehash of the Carrie Underwood hit ""Before He Cheats"" crossed with Anna Nallick's ""Breath"".  Let's not forget ""Born this Way"" being a huge Madonna rip-off.  There is nothing original or innovative on this CD.3. Can you spell P-r-o-d-u-c-e-r?  It sounds like they spent an hour or less mixing and producing this CD.  It is sloppy at best.4. Stop repeating your own name!5. Is she trying to gain a country following?TRY AGAIN!"
Thanks Amazon and Gaga for a 2nd chance at downloading.  Great tunes great cloud music and great enjoyment.  Awesome! I will be using the cloud as a result!
"Personally I couldn't wait until Lady Gaga released this album. Hearing the song ""Born this way"" got me really pumped for the album itself. And I have to say Gaga didn't fail to deliver. She includes a wide variety of musical styles such as opera mariachi pop rock-n-roll and even delivers a country infused ""You and I"" which is one of the album's strongest points. With killer hooks and catchy rhythms it's impossible to dislike every song on the album there's something in it for everybody. She even uses different languages including spanish french and some german(it's more like german gibberish but it still works). Now the tracks themselves are good but the way they are ordered could have been done better. A perfect example would be placing ""Electric Chapel"" after ""Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)"" and ""Heavy Metal Lover"" the album tends to be repetitve and kind of redundant. But don't let this distract you from the high quality of this album and I'm not just saying this because I'm a Gaga fan it's my unbiased opinion. When people say this album is all hype don't believe them or else you will miss out on a truly great piece of work."
"loved her last 2 albums so maybe my expectations were set too high. felt the strength of the fame monster -- ie. catchy danceable riffs -- was mostly missing here. i found many of the songs flat . . . and just sorta weird. ""judas"" was one exception and even that song was IMO only so-so compared to some of her earlier work. i got that she was trying to be creative with the 80's stuff (the one success was ""edge of glory"") but it didn't really work for me. won't be listening to this much."
For me downloading this album has taken patience but it is worth it.  Just don't close out the downloader.  Lady GaGa is the modern form of Madonna and she will probably be around for a long time as she keeps putting out the hits.
"Lady Gaga's new album ""Born this Way"" is incredible! Not a single dull track on the cd. A bit different from her earlier all-dance tracks but still very upbeat with many more dance tracks. There is more depth to these tunes but they are all still very catchy. I purchased the special edition the day it was released at Best Buy. By far my favorite album of 2011! Other than the current hit singles that have been released off this album Marry the Night You and I Government Hooker Americano and Scheisse are my favorite tracks. Amazing stuff. If you're a little monster then do yourself a favor and buy the special edition. It includes a few bonus tracks and bonus disc with the country road version of Born this Way as well as a few remixes of her hits. 5 stars!"
Despite what the 1 star reviews say about how they can't download the songs those problems are now fixed.Lady Gaga has done it yet again! This is a great album with some catchy tunes. You have to install the amazon mp3 downloader to get the songs but it's an easy process. This album is well worth the money.
"Got this album for 99 cents and I normally don't listen to Gaga but I thought ""what the hell"" for 99  cents but I listened to it and I gotta say It's pretty solid. I'm a big electronic junkie and the album definitely had a great electronic beat to it. I may just be becoming a fan of Lady Gaga. Shh! Don't tell my guy friends. What the hell who cares this album is awesome!"
After I finally got the album due to Amazon's cloud issue finally got a chance to listen to it.  Overall a good album but not as good as last.
"Love this entire album just like I loved her last entire album.  Im a fairly new Gaga fan and truthfully I didnt know who she was until a couple summers ago.  When I heard her music it reminded me of how music used to be fun about dancing and letting go.  Just hearing it makes you want to move and it somehow imbibes you with confidence even if you're a shy person. I can't dance and I dont club because Im a dork and I feel unsexy.  Gaga's music makes me feel sexy and that's hard to do lol.What I love about this particular album is I feel it speaks to some serious heartfelt issues in us all.  We all want to be ourselves we all want to be loved we all want to feel gorgeous and awesome.  We want to feel like we matter to someone.  The tracks on Born This Way are for everyone who's ever felt down about themselves for any reason. It's for everyone who didn't have a perfect childhood for everyone who still feels like a dorky kid at the ripe age of 30 etc.  When LG sings to you you feel it and that's a very rare quality in any singer.I dont really understand all the fuss over ""this is too Madonna"" etc.  Madonna was one of the originals to do what she did but she's not the first to break any molds.  Madge has sort of passed her prime as the 'go to' of female pop royalty.  Im totally ok with a new face taking over those power reins especially someone as talented as Gaga.  Even if her music or taste isnt to your liking you have to admit this woman can siiiiing.  I enjoy her voice far more than I ever did Madonna's and I love Madonna always have.  She made the same splashes in the same way but in a different time.  Not everyone today had the joy of the Blond Ambition Tour but they can enjoy the Monster Ball in the same way :).Anyways from someone unbiased and unaffected by media oversat whatever this album is fantastic.  I love the beats love the lyrics love the voice.  It just about kicks ass like a flaming boot made of meat.  If you'd like some fun AND heartfelt music to make you feel sexy BTW definitely wont let you down.Im a little monster from here on out :E  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"
Very talented lady. She is the current generations ultimate performer. She knows how to get noticed and she stands up for the defenseless.
Lady Gaga's Born This Way Album is one of the best of this year. Every song sends it's own message and they're all able to move to.
I had the same problem! I only got 3 songs.....so lame! Please get it fixed! I was so looking forward to this album! &lt;/3
Amazing beats vocals and songwriting! Expect the unexpected from Gaga and be amazed. Every track will make you want to dance.
I read about all the problems others had with this and wanted to add my 99 cents.  My download worked fine.  I must have been one of the lucky ones.  Great deal for a great price.  Thank you Amazon.  :)
Tired disco beats from another era all sounding bland and quite the same as all her other stuff with a few blatant Madonna ripoffs. She basically just changes the lyrics and reuses the same tracks. Ughhh!
Although I purchased this roughly six hours ago and I still only have two songs I trust the rest will come with time. I'm a Gaga fan so I'm sure I'll like the complete album.My rating is technically only for the songs I've already heard but I thought that the album could use some love since it's being rated low because of the technical issues with Amazon.
Only doing this review to get amazon not to recommend me this crap.Everything from the cover to songs and videos are cheap simple easylistening pile of useless garbage that is made for average joe consumer who loves sugar coated melodies and brainless lyrics.Cover colours and titles of songs may suggest association with metal or gothic genre. Don't be fooled. Cover is an atrocity btw.Its a pity this sells... This proves that most people don't appreciate proper music. Not that I care.
this is the steal of the year!!! and the download was FLAWLESS! Seriously it took about 30 seconds and i had the whole album on my itunes. GET IT NOW...before AMAZON comes to it's senses.
Took a while butI got the album and I am totally pleased with the purchase... Five Star album. Nuff said...
The beats are orgasmic the lyrics are unique and new unlike any other generic pop song. They go under the surface and each song has a different mood and feel. The guitar the piano the screaming. This is the album of the decade.
I love this album. It is one of the best. I just downloaded like two days ago. The soung quality is the best
Let me just start by saying that although I consider myself a little monster but had this album sucked I would have been the first to say. It's amazing! Definitely a lot of upbeat techno-ish beats on this album but I'm not complaining. If you listen to the WORDS you'll understand why I really do love this album. Did I mention it was only $.99...yea that doesn't hurt either. Gaga and Amazon definitely made a great choice & in my opinion are trendsetting for future artist.
Definitely one of the best albums ever created.  So Great So Powerful So inspirational!!! It's not your typical pop it's not your average rock.  It's the most exciting and epic album ever! It's truly avant-garde techno rock. Such a great sound! 5 Stars!!!!!
This is my favorite album of all time!1. Marry the Night - 10/102. Born This Way - 10/103. Government Hooker - 10/104. Judas - 10/105. Americano - 10/106. Hair - 10/107. Schei&szlig;e - 10/108.

not fair to La Gaga for us to give low stars for e-delivery issues on today's special deal.upon download in the early afternoon i only got two songs and the cover art pdf.by 11pm Amazon fixed the issue and i now have 14 songs.  love gaga & amazon!
Yes the album did take slightly longer than expected to download. But it DID download in probably 30 minutes and that's to be expected with a deal like this! THANK YOU AMAZON and THANK YOU GAGA for an amazing product at an amazing price!!! Love it!
Can't say enough about Lady Gaga. Her unique style appeals to the masses and this latest album is destined to produce many hits. Great work Gaga!
im not a fan of gaga but its a great album all the songs are really good. i love the edgy of glory.
can only listen to one song and the digital booklet.  This is contrary to EVERY OTHER album I have found where you get full rights.This is just a promo for their cloud player which does no good if you have apple products to listen to them on.Really bummed and I am one of their most loyal customers.
If you want this anytime in the next...6 hours or so...don't bother downloading it from Amazon...it's not happening.  They don't even apologize when you contact them via online chat!
The CD was damaged and unable to play.  wish I had purchased new. Never again will I buy a used cd
"I am one of Lady Gaga's monsters but to be honest this album was a bit of a disappointment for me. It has 3 hit single so far: Born This Way Judas and Edge fo Glory. Born This Way has a great message (just be yourself) but isn't as well put together as let's say Just Dance or Poker Face. Judas is a much better written song but the lyrics I think would offend a lot of people. The only really great single is Edge of Glory. I found two other songs on this album to be very creative and have some of the spark of Gaga's previous hits.  Those songs were Hair and Highway Unicorn. Here is why I titled my review ""GAGA GONE MAD!"": the album is 17 songs long and most of them are just plain scary!! More than 50% of this album's songs creeped me out. Less may have been more... I think the album could have been improved by omitting some of the more out-there songs."
I don't understand why everyone is complaining. I bought it and the ENTIRE cd was downloaded in about 5 min. I only give this 1 star bc I don't like Lady Gaga. I bought it bc it was only 99 and I kinda like 2 songs making it worth the 99 purchase. So if you like Lady Gaga or even just ONE song or so on this cd I suggest you buy it today bc it is a bargin :) YAY Amazon!!
Very excited about it being only .99...but only 4 of the songs have shown up so far...the rest of the album is grayed out??
I just bought this album for .99 which is crazy to me! I had no problem with the download. I was ready to wait as I know that a lot of people was going to download this album at the same time as me but to be honest with you I didn't have to wait long at all. Love pretty much all the songs but then I love Lady GAGA!
i loved born this way album it had awesome songs. i was always a little monster fan. i loved born this wayu and ithe edge of glory marry the night. i love lady gaga shes awesome
I keep reading that people feel they were ripped off but you really weren't.  I know in this digital age we expect everything instantly but with this high of a volume it's understandable that it will take some time for songs to be available (we have been spoiled by faster technology).  Just be patient!I got most songs right away although I expect by now traffic has died down a bit and aside from two songs that are still processing it's all there.  I downloaded to the cloud right away and it seems to work faster than trying to download to your computer plus then you can let it download by itself in the background with no worries.  First time I've used Amazon Cloud and gotta say I like it.  Yes it may not be as good as others but it gets the job done plus now I have my music available everywhere I go and worry about getting it to my computer.As for the album I love it!  She pushes the envelope again and I can't get enough of her.  She is a great artist and despite her eccentricities she is genius and always speaks the truth.  Way to go Gaga!
Great music to listen to daily.  Great to drive down the road and blast!!!!!!  Great Motivator to GO!!!!  My Favorite album at this time.  Wonderful purchase that I will never regret.  Wow Ga Ga gets my attention and keeps me movin.
I can't believe I got this album for a dollar.  This just goes to show that amazon is a serious contender against apple and their total dominance in digital music downloads.  Pick this one up you wont regret it not only that you get 20 gb of cloud storage free!
This album has much to love. Most of the tunes are catchy and memorable. The artistic variety on display here is impressive. You'll see a sampling of different styles and personas and all of it communicates a raw passion. Here we peer into the heart and mind of a social commentator and musician.
At first I was a little hesitant about buying this since it is the follow up to her other albums but I did buy it and I'm glad I did. My favorite song on this is The edge of Glory. When you hear that song it makes you wanna dance dance dance...Dont get me wrong I also love Judas and Born this way too..I've listened to the rest of the songs on this and they are great as well even though they are starting to grow on me a little more everytime I listen to them but all in all this a really great album..
"I love Lady Gaga. She has an amazing voice! I love her attitude everything she stands for and stands up for. She was calling this album ""the best album of the decade."" So of course I purchased the album. What a huge disappointment. There isn't a single song that stands out. She barely uses her wonderful voice. She yells a lot and just seems to kind of talk the rest of the time. Where is the piano that she so beautifully plays? Where are her heartfelt lyrics that she can belt out like no other artist? It's not a horrible album but it isn't anything worth owning. If I hadn't paid only .99 for this whole album I would be demanding my money back."
Only the pdf has downloaded but message is that my purchase is complete.  Where do I complain on the Amazon website?  I haven't listened yet so haven't rated appropriately.
this is a great album on multiple levels from the catchy hooks and dance-inspiring beats to the lyrics and overall theme of self-worth and self-acceptance. its hard to listen to her album without getting up and dancing around my office! i highly recommend it to anyone who likes pop music techno or 80's inspired tunes.
...but this is a pretty good song. Might find some others that I like. If I were 15 years younger she might be the shizzle. lol
I bought this album yesterday and downloaded the songs in the evening. It took all of 5 minutes to download. Amazon must have fixed the server issues because I didn't see what other downloaders were complaining about. Great deal. Happy camper.
Born this way shows the versatility of Lady Gaga as an artist that has more depth and can cross different genres. It's a much better album than her first although it dances have as many club-style hits that are more fun but not deep. This album has a lot more depth and creative talent displayed and touches on deeper issues than her debut. That being said it could've used one or two more fun songs to really dance to but overall it's worth buying.
This album took quite a long time to download. Eventually it all came through & all 14 songs work as promised. Folks line up all day for free music.
The price was .99 for the album when I bought it unfortunatly I should have remembered that I don't like Lady Gaga....
Lady Gaga's music is not for everyone but I'm a huge fan and will always support her music. Love it!
This album is by far my favorite Lady Gaga CD yet. It does vary from her preious music a bit but I would go as far as to say that it is an improvement when compared to her previous albums. My personal favorites were You and I Marry the Night and The Edge of Glory. A must-have for all Lady Gaga fans!
Great CD great music!  I have not checked out the Digital booklet part yet I just loaded it to my Iphone so I could take the music where ever I go and put the CD in my car for on the road.
"Let me preface this by stating that I love Lady Gaga.  I think The Fame Monster is virtually flawless and I still listen to it regularly.  That being said I see no reason to give her a free pass just because I think she's great.  I had a lot of problems with Born This Way and I'm not sure how to feel about this CD.  Parts of it are flawless; a lot of it sucks.  Track by Track review ahoy!Marry The Night (2/5) - This song is growing on me a little.  It is definitely catchy but unfortunately it sets the tone for the rest of the CD.Born This Way (1/5) - There is just so much I hate about this song.  Everyone knows what this sounds like so there's no need to get into that.  What I dislike the most is that Gaga has proclaimed this song to be the Best Gay Anthem Ever.  There is zero subtlety to this song and there is little to draw true inspiration from.  Totally calculated in my opinion.Government Hooker (3/5) - I know a lot of people have trashed this song. It's true that the lyrics are completely insipid and the screeching ""HOOOOOOOKAAAAHHH"" is obnoxious.  But this beat is FIERCE.  It just makes me want to strut around my apartment in the highest heels I have smearing lipstick on the walls or something haha.Judas (2.5/5) - I don't mind this song.  There is a lot happening musically and I really think this song would have benefitted from some paring down.  The best part of the song is the breakdown (despite the fact Gaga is terrible rapper) and the bridge which is all percussion.Americano (2.5/5) - Okay Full disclosure.  I kind of love this song - the driving beat the handclaps the trumpets the terrible Spanish all of it. BUT - for some reason Gaga insists on singing in foreign languages with terrible accents and she butchers a lot of Spanish for a large portion of this song. Wasn't there ANYONE to tell her that it sounds pretty awful?Hair (2/5) - The Sax makes it's first grand appearance.  Clarence Clemons is undoubtedly talented but his inclusion makes the song almost seems like a parody.  All this reminds me of is theme songs from 90s TV shows like Full House.  This song works better as a self-empowerment anthem - I think it's because the focus is decidedly more personal than talking about being ""Orient-made"".Sheibe (3.5/5) - I want to love this song - and it starts out awesomely (bad ""German"" aside).  But...Gaga seems slavishly devoted to this terribly dated techno/quasi-industrial sound.  Minor key verses Major key chorus.  It could be so sinister and dark but the chorus wrecks it.  I will still probably jam out to this.Bloody Mary (5/5) - Gaga really shines on this one. There aren't a lot of vocal acrobatics but the restraint really fits with the music here.  It is dark and melancholy and I like this direction a lot more than the 80's power pop.  This is just a tightly crafted song and I can't stop listening to it.  Best song of the album for me.Black Jesus + Amen Fashion (3/5) - I like this song but it's nothing spectacular. The beat is nice and I can dance to it.Bad Kids (1.5/5) - this is another almost for me.  The drum machine is rocking to be sure but I HATE HATE HATE the chord progression in the chorus. It grates on me something awful and renders this song totally unlistenable which is a shame because I like the rest of the song.Fashion of His Love (0/5) - You can tell from the opening strains of this song exactly how it is going to go.  This song is terrible from top to bottom and is probably the worst thing Lady Gaga has ever written.Highway Unicorn (Road to Love)  (0/5) - Gaga has to be trolling us with these song titles. Jesus the intro sounds like Van Halen and it hurts me.  I have no idea what's happening right now - I guess this is what pop would sound like if unicorns wrote it?  I just can't.Heavy Metal Lover (4/5) - This song is pure sleaze and I love it. The only detractor is that the lyrics are kind of cringe-worthy.Electric Chapel (4/5) - Another standout track.  It's giving me Galaxy Ranger Fever (cowboys in space!) and that probably why I love it so much. Yes it borrows wholesale from groups like Enigma - the church bells the chanting the synths - yet somehow it works and I like it .The Queen (2.5/5) - I'm feeling pretty ambivalent about this one. I don't hate it I don't love it. Though I enjoy the guitar duet/solo.You And I - This sounds just like Queen and it makes me rage so hard. I understand that they were a huge influence on Lady Gaga but this song irritates me to death and back. I'd bet both my big toes that this will be a single and a big one at that. While it's a well written tune this offends me on a personal level that I can't fully articulate.  I just cannot get behind this.The Edge of Glory (4/5) - This is song is going to be huge.  And truthfully it is a solidly crafted song.  Do I like it?  I will probably be Stockholm Syndromed into enjoying it because I'm going to hear this every time I turn on the radio or go out in public.  Does this make me happy?  NO!Obviously the overarching theme for Born This Way is being true to yourself no matter what.  But to veil that in all of these ""shocking"" religious overtones is just the most. This whole Jesus Mary and Joseph are Government Hookahs thing is just tiresome. It's trite and it's been done and Madonna is still alive.  I'm just saying.The vast majority of these songs sound so incredibly dated and I really don't know what else to say except that they are giving me late 80's/early 90's fever.  To be fair I was a kid then but I remember the music and to say that Gaga borrows heavily from that era is an understatement.  She aped everything but the hammer pants and the puff paint.Born This Way just falls so far short of the mark.  I suppose that's the way it goes when you really stretch yourself creatively.  A few times (Bloody Mary Edge of Glory) this sound she is working with really truly works. The rest is a spectacular mess.  All of the songs are tightly crafted - that much cannot be denied - but they mostly just sound out of touch instead of sounding she is bringing the past into the far reaches of the future (which is what I think Gaga was going for).  This album will probably sound like a revelation to anyone under the age of 18 - those tender-footed young folks with no frame of reference for the music Lady Gaga is borrowing from - or anyone not interested in anything but the current pop landscape.2.5/5 Stars"
As always Lady Gaga comes through with her album.  Most of the songs are very catchy.  I would highly recommend.  You won't be disappointed.
All you people who say she's not good anymore try really listening to her music! And you must STOP saying it's made to be commercially successful! I mean have you heard Katy Perry Rihanna Britney Spears and Justin Bieber songs? They're disgusting and yet you buy them!
"""Born This Way"" by Lady Gaga is a musical kalediscope of pop rock and dance (with different songs that actually work together).  The appeal to many of these songs on this compilation is that many of the meanings to the songs have various meanings to them such as the quirky ""Government Hooker"" and the ""Fashion of His Love"".  I am only guessing that ""Government Hooker"" is about being many things to those around you (subconsciously acting in accordance to how someone expects you to act). ""Fashion of His Love"" appears to be comparing how a love of certain fashion is almost related to when you intensely care about someone. However my two favorite songs on this catchy cd are ""Heavy Metal Lover"" and ""Edge of Glory"".  ""Heavy Metal Lover"" seems to be a musical track about group love.  ""The Edge of Glory"" is a daring song about taking controversial chances in the personal life arena.  The easiest way to determine if you are going to like ""Born this Way"" is if you are open to enjoy pop rockand dance music. In addition I have recently been to one of her concerts where she put much effort and fun energy into her musical performances. This compilation is similiar in the sense that you get a sense that she put forth much of that exciting energy and fused it in her songs on the ""Born This Way"" collection."
When The Fame came out I enjoyed it.  When The Fame Monster came out I adored it!  It took the elements of The Fame and added a little bit more shadow to it.  Born This Way continues down the dark alley The Fame Monster peeked down.  I am in love with this album.  There's a little something for whatever mood you're in -Marry the Night and Hair for when you wanna dance Government Hooker and Scheibe for when you wanna feel a little dirty and dark Born This Way and The Edge of Glory for a little encouragement and You and I for Gaga's version of the piano ballad. (This album's Speechless and/or Brown Eyes :))If I hadn't already pre-ordered the album I would absolutely take advantage of the 99 cent offer!  I'm tempted to just buy a bunch and gift them to people even those who aren't huge Gaga fans. hahaNote: It's sad that you can't really take the average rating to heart since people have been giving low ratings to AMAZON and not Gaga for her fantastic work here.  &lt;3 Mother Monster!
"So the 99cent deal was pretty sweet. I heard a few new songs from her (that are in this album) on the radio and wasn't too excited- thought maybe there would be something else on the album I would like... not really.I really liked her ""older"" stuff... but this will just be added to the songs I barely touch on my playlist.wasn't impressed. the 2 stars was because it was 99cents. I'm glad I didn't pay more for it."
i really love this album it shows that Gaga is more than just a person who can crank out hits. You can tell she put a lot of love into this record and wanted to make sure that it had a positive message and that it was something little monsters would be proud of. It has a lot of really good songs on it and the more you listen to them the better they get!
This is not Lady Gaga's usual style but I like some of the songs based on the samples. And for 99cents it is a steal:) I know that it taking time to download we have to be patient the cloud crashed from the overload of downloads ( I called customer service).
I didn't care for most of the songs but there were a few I loved. I'm sure some of the other ones will grow on me in time.
Lots of thumping beat to techno pop background music.Can't say I like Gaga trying to Rap her singing voice is OKShould be OK in my convertible going down the freeway with the top down.Thump Thump Thump ...For 99 cents I feel like I got my money's worth.
Ok I know all the Little Monsters will hate me for saying it but it's true.  Don't look for anything new here.  Actually it sounds kinda retro.  Not dated just retro.  Which isn't a bad thing.  If you are like me and are a sucker for a good dance album this one is for you.  Look past her weirdness and trying to push buttons and get your butt out to the dancefloor.  One thing I do like about this album is that her vocals aren't constantly distorted.  You can actually hear what she is singing.  I wouldn't say that songs are deep either but they are well written.  She sounds kinda like a pop-diva in love on the song Fashion of His Love.  Bad Kids is another sugar coated pop song as well but still flows great and makes you wanna dance and sing along with it.  Marry the Night and Edge of Glory sound like they could be remixes of 80's songs from Heart or Roxette with a modern twist.  Not a total flop of an album.  Just doesn't really live up to the hype that it's going to be a breakthrough album or anything.  Pure dance-pop fun is what is contained on these discs.  Not a bad thing...just not what we were told it was going to be.
This is by far the best Lady Gaga album ever even though she's only released 3. I love all of her songs and these are the best. All of the songs are amazing. She's amazing. Okay it is different but no good artist stays the same throughout their entire career and Lady Gaga is certainly not one of the artists that does. She changes her style with each new release and manages to do it perfectly. And that's what this album is. Perfection.
Well it is 8:15 eastern time zone May 23rd 2011 and the album downloaded for me in less than 8 minutes perfectly.  Excellent album also...a little different from her last one but some great club beats are in there.  Government Hooker is my fav. so far.  Thank you amazon for my 99 cent purchase!!
"Lady Gaga's second album is noticeably different from the first in mood and in thematic content. I was not in love with it on the first listen but on the second listen I began to see the light and each successive listen has made me appreciate it more. I say this to make the point that anyone who gave up after one listen because it was not enough like ""The Fame"" is missing out on something special.It is a rather dark album; not all dark but in my opinion the darker moments are some of the best ones. ""Marry The Night"" is mainstream dance music which sounds innocent enough but the lyrics say ""I'm gonna marry the dark/Gonna make love to the stark/I'm a soldier to my own emptiness"" so this is no ordinary night out. On ""Government Hooker"" the unique identity of this album really begins. It takes us into a sort of underworld and to support this it has a very nasty I would say menacing bass groove with the voice of ""Government"" saying things like ""Back up and turn around/Put your hands on the ground/Get down."" ""Judas"" is one of many songs which feature religious references. It has a rock/disco vibe behind lyrics such as ""Jesus is my virtue/And Judas is the demon I cling to."" ""Americano"" is a Hispanic sequel to ""Alejandro"" from ""The Fame"" but it is less playful more desperate.  ""Scheibe"" adds German to Gaga's linguisic repertoire and the music is rock/disco like that in ""Judas"" with more bass groove similar to that in ""Government Hooker"". The lyrics have a feminist edge: ""When I'm on a mission/I rebuke my condition/If you're a strong female you don't need permission.""""Bloody Mary"" is one of my favorites on the album. It is slower and quieter than the other tracks and it has obvious although ambiguous religious allusions such as  ""When Pontius comes to kill the king upon his throne/I'm ready for their stones."" I also like Gaga's vocal quality on this track and on ""Electric Chapel""; I would describe it as more subdued smoother sweeter. There are dark sounds and visions in ""Heavy Metal Lover"" and ""Electric Chapel"" two more of my favorites. In the first one ""Red wine and cheap perfume/And a filthy shout"" accompany the night's amorous activities in which ""A group does it better"" in ""a full house of leather"". In ""Electric Chapel"" love is more intimate and even mystical beginning with ""My body is sanctuary/My blood is pure"" and ending with ""I need something sacred from you/Down on our knees we'll find a way/To make a pure love work in a dirty world."" The sound of both tracks is appropriately dark and serious with plenty of electric guitar in ""Electric Chapel"".There are other highlights not necessarily dark ones. ""Born This Way"" is a retro-sounding dance number directed toward those who feel like outcasts from mainstream society. Likewise ""Bad Kids"" is both an affirmation and a defense for Gaga's younger fans. I'm not sure what ""Highway Unicorn"" is all about but the lyrics are lots of fun about a girl who is a ""free soul burning roads with a flag in her bra."" ""The Edge Of Glory"" ends the album the same way it began with an exuberant mainstream dance anthem. Overall I doubt that this album will be the ""monster"" of commercial success that ""The Fame"" turned out to be but I do believe that it will enhance Lady Gaga's reputation as a hitmaker and songwriter. The incorporation of  themes that are more complex and more ""adult"" shows a growth that would be missing if she had set out simply to duplicate her earlier success."
"Unlike most of the reviews of ""Born This Way"" (and many other new releases) this was written after sitting with the album for nearly a year. Most of the noise both pro and con concerning Lady Gaga currently exists in the form of hastily ejaculated poorly punctuated ranting. I write this for people who are truly curious about this album's sound more specifically its place in the wider music world.Lady Gaga's been enjoying immense success and popularity recently building a reputation among the mostly uncritical press as a daring and original multimedia ""artiste."" I thought Poker Face was a smart and sassy pop song and am still impressed with the theatrical sound of Bad Romance but I've largely been underwhelmed with Lady Gaga's output. Generally her stuff falls into one of two categories: 1) ""not bad but it doesn't really stand out"" or 2) ""this sounds WAY too much like (past pop hit) for my comfort!"" She's loads better than Katy Perry and no worse than someone like Christina Aguilera but I've never understood where the fanatical obsession came from. Perhaps this is simply reflective of contemporary music culture specifically of listeners who have abandoned earlier generations' standards of greatness in performance yet are still drawn like moths to the flame to worship anyone who happens to be in the spotlight as if they were the next (past legend). Whatever it may be the fact remains that ""Born This Way"" is a largely homogeneous forgettable affair. Many of the cuts likely sizzle in the clubs but staying power is not the order of the day.The album's strongest song is the opener Marry the Night. The stomping beats and sleazy buzzing synths make it a perfect club anthem. The problem is that save for the modern production it's just a by-the-numbers Eurodance anthem from the early '90s. It's practically begging to have a corny rap interlude (eg: ""gonna marry the night cuz it feels so right; when I drive in my car I look up at the stars"" etc). It's fun but I've largely heard it before...From there it's more familiar territory. The title track is a shameless rip of Madonna's Express Yourself (Madonna herself called it ""reductive"") Edge of Glory sounds a hundred other Cher-styled disco stompers Government Hooker is a lesser version of Britney's Gimme More and Judas just ""sounds WAY too much like (Bad Romance) for my comfort."" Most of the other songs are embarrassing exercises in style (Americano You & I) rehashes of other songs on the album (Bloody Mary) or just nondescript dancefloor filler. Scheisse is kind of fun but I doubt I'll ever think to play it a few years from now.The production is well done but over the course of the entire album it feels very samey with almost no contrast or breathing room available. The net result is a competent effervescent pop experience that while great for the dancefloor is wearisome and not likely to endure the test of time.It's obvious that Gaga has some talent but this album shows no growth from her debut only amplification. There may eventually be an album in her career that finally pulls me into her orbit of adoring moths but this one isn't it."
"1. I haven't listened in full yet so I have no idea if I'll like the music or not.  But unfair rating of Gaga for Amazon's server issues is just plain stupid.2. That said I had no issues- sure it took an hour or so to download but I didn't use the Cloud downloaded straight to my computer and only had to hit ""Retry"" once and BAM- now I have the whole album.  Easy peasy.3. For $.99 can you really complain about a short wait?  Come ON...  At least you didn't have to leave your house.4. Gaga I love you but I'm sorry- that album cover art is ridiculous.  &lt;3"
...it's edited.  Can't complain at the cost but I personally don't believe in edited music a big beep in a song takes away from the experience.
She needs to quit looking at the Madonna playbook and just be herself. This doesn't even sound like what many thought Lady Gaga would be. She's a flash in the pan.
"Get some hot pepper spiced gin in an ice cold glass.  Drink it pour it in your ears it burns like fire either way.  This is the effect of Gaga's latest fantasy world--hot infectious degenerate rebellious.  Gaga lights the disc up with synths pounding beats and that something that her imitators do not have--her voice.  She constantly impresses me with the power of her vocals--she has all the talent that you could hope for and she uses it to light up the dance floor.  This album is a little harder than the last but not in a way that should put off any of her fans just make them dance harder.  If you need a new companion to your workouts or something to sing too loudly in the car on a road trip this album will fit the bill nicely.  Great danceable pop by a master provocateur.  ""Americano"" is a delightful side of infectious dance--""I met a girl in East L.A. in floral shorts as sweet as May...we fell in love but not in court"" Gaga sings inviting us all to sing along dance along and the tune is impossible to get out of your mind.  As a bonus the song is sung in a hybrid of Spanish and English as catchy as anything you will hear this year.  ""We don't care what people say we know the truth"" she declares brashly in the opening of ""Bad Kids""...""Don't be insecure if your heart is pure you're still good to me if you're a bad kid baby""  seems like a ray of hope in a season of uncontrolled misundertanding and pain; the lyrics are a heart breaking indictment of family gone awry hinting at a deeper pain that may be show may be pathos may be real.  With Gaga it is hard to know what is real what is a pose and in the end as long as it speaks to you I suppose it doesn't matter.  In one of the most ironic lines sung with a straight face by anyone in recent memory she sings ""I'm not that cool and you hate me"" (ha) sings to the insecure teenager in all of us.  The fact that it is wrapped up in such a catchy package is fantastic.I love this album already and am certain that it will be burning up my speakers all summer long.  It wouldn't surprise me based even on my limited first listens is that this may very well keep a space on my ipod for a long time to come."
Had no trouble getting every song. Did the one click to order the cd. And less than 10 seconds I was streaming it from my Droid. Amazon MP3 store is leaps and bounds better than iTunes. I think I've been converted.
"I feel like I'm getting away with something that I'm not suppose to....99 cents for a whole album from a mega artist and free cloud space!! C'mon this is a real no brainer!!  Great promotion for the new album and a great way to introduce new users to cloud based storage....oh yeah for FREE! The other thing that's cool is this is being promoted kind of on the down low which gives it an ""in the know"" feel from the Amazon user underground!  Awesome job to Lady GaGa and Amazon!"
Sometimes second albums can be a bit of a let down but not this one simply great it is individual just like lady gaga and it is worth it.
The sides was all bent and all out of shape and I bought it new send me a free new one please
"When I downloaded these tracks I thought this album would deliver the same punch the previous two did despite my negative opinion of ""Born This Way"" and ""Judas.""  However upon listening to this CD I found myself incapable of making it through a whole song.  I kept skipping around because of the lackluster lyrics singing and choppy music production.  Worse still I found many of these songs downright...creepy.  I originally didn't want to purchase the physical CD because the images on the back and front gave me the creeps (I didn't even want to ride the NYC shuttle to Times Square because the images were plastered all over it) but now I see that the album artwork and music are perfectly suited for one another.  This album is much darker than her others and it certainly isn't for me (if you like a poppy Gaga it won't be for you either).  I'm pretty sure the only song that will make its way into my iTunes is ""The Edge of Glory.""  Maybe I'll add the first track too but I sadly don't even remember that song's title.  I will of course give future Gaga songs a chance but I am just so disappointed in this CD's quality."
I really liked this album. I love Lady GaGa'singing. I think her voice is totally awesome. She has a lot of her hits inthis CD. Which I like. Can't go wrong with this CD. I've bought lots of CD's from Amazon and I've been very pleased witheverything I've gotten. Thanks Amazon. Keep up the good work.
I don't know if we will ever have that answer but I do know that Lady Gaga is a woman of many talents. I enjoy all the tracks from this CD. Gaga seldom disappoints with her music in my opinion. Granted I didn't always appreciate her songs but once I REALLY listened to the person I began to listen and like the artist. Highly recommend.
It literally took less than a minute to download this the 14 songs and a little longer for the booklet.  Frankly I would have waited a lot longer for it to download if I had to.  It's 99 cents and I fully expected there to be a ton of people downloading it at that price.  It's common sense.  Thanks Amazon and Gaga for the music.
I'm a new fan of Lady Gaga.  I love to listen to this album when driving or exercising.  Very happy with purchase
The songs are okay. None of them are horrible. They're not interesting or memorable enough. Even &#34;Born This Way&#34; was only mildly interesting because of all the different covers.
I've been waiting for this album for months now. Lady Gaga is my absolute favorite artist. Her songs on this album are very rock techno. She sings a lot about love and being who you are which everybody needs to hear every once in in a while.I listen to every song on this album over and over again because some are fun while others are sad but still catchy.Right now it's only a dollar so how could you go wrong?
I like Lady Gaga so I was excited for the new Cd. I am not that impressed with the CD but for $1 I can't complain!
It is one thing to listen to Lady GaGa but it is amazing to watch her! I love her lyrics and her bold positions on today's issues. Great bargain with the DVD and 2 CD's http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005WZZRD8/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_img
I tried to download the album this morning and I am still waiting for the rest of the songs (only 4 work) to play. I really hope Amazon figures this out. I reallllly would like to hear the entire album.
Not her best album especially in comparison to her 1st one. Does have maybe 2/3 songs I like. Glad I only paid .99 during the 24hr special.
Much of this album is very reminiscent of Madonna; however as someone who grew up listening to Madonna I think that is part of what makes Lady Gaga so good. Madonna was SO controversial for her time and Lady Gaga is more of an updated version. I enjoy the variety in her songs her unique and constantly changing look and general gutsy attitude. I think she puts herself out there like Madonna does she holds nothing back and therefore comparisons will be drawn. In regards to this album specifically yes it's very pop (that her genre!) not all the songs are 100% amazing. I am listening to her sing about her hair right now and I'm not super impressed with the somewhat trite concept of living as free as your hair - particularly when your hair is mostly extensions and not even yours...but whatever. Overall it's an enjoyable album and she lived up to my expectations with this one.
ARTPOP is still her best work of all times.Nice moments on Title Tracc& Blacc J + A Fashionbut the rest is no good.Fly front cover thou.
Forget Madonna and Bruce Springsteen Gaga has been channeling Jim Steinman and Meat Loaf for this Opus- this is her 'Bat out of Hell' down to the picture on the CD.I loved the dance music of her first two albums but this one is definitely pop bordering on rock....And who the the hell has EVER put their best song last ?!!!You have to admire her balls!P.S. And it arrived on Saturday two days early - thank God for Amazon !P.P.S I've found this is the perfect album to drive from Santa Barbara to L.A. - just the right length...
This is such a great CD. It is truy addicting. Hair is by far my favorite song - truly inspiring! I have not stopped listening to it since I got it on 5+23+11 at 4AM!! Gaga keep up the great work.
Saw Lady Gaga on a very good interview and loved what she had to say so I ordered 'Born this Way'. Unfortunately I just couldn't get into it and thought many of the tunes had the same beat and sound - very techo.  I truly was looking forward to it but will pass it along to someone who can appreciate her talented ways.
This is a wonderful album. I think it's really solid. Every song sounds different it's really dance-y. If you like Lady Gaga you'll still like this album. 5-stars for a great album.
"Call me an obsessed Little Monster. Revoke my indie kid card or my credibility as a reviewer. Call me a crazed teeny bopper who wouldn't know good music if it bit them in the butt. I know what I like and I *love* this album. It is every bit as epic as I anticipated exceeding all the expectations I had for the album and in my opinion leaving The Fame and The Fame Monster (Both incredible albums in their own right) in the dust.I've been in love with music for as long as I can remember. I got my first ""Big kid"" album at the tender age of 5 (it was Britney's debut album and what can I say? I was born just in time for the pop music craze) and it all just escalated from there. It's been my obsession for a decade at least very probably more. I've gotten a reputation for being both a bookworm and a music junkie in addition to writer and for some reason beyond me singer. In any case music is my life blood. I'm all about the music which is why I love Lady Gaga (she also has an incredible passion for music not just as a luxury but as an art form) and why I love this album. Each song is a little gem and they each have their own individual quirk and flavor but they all have this big sound and from beginning to end this album is epic.1. Marry the Night- Gaga starts us off on the album with this song and it's epic sound with the sound of church bells in the background and powerful lyrics it's a love song to New York and also an incredible dance song. It was definitely an instant favorite for me from the first verse to the addictive chorus it's got an incredible powerful epic and haunting quality I think. Gaga's vocals are incredibly solid as they are on just about all the tracks off this album. More on this later. I love the sound and the feel of this track and something about it is just special. 5/5.2. Born This Way- Okay I admit I've grown a little weary of this song due to it's extensive exposure through different media outlets after initially falling in love with it the night it dropped. I still love it. It's message is empowering especially for someone like me who has always felt out of place who felt like a ""freak"" however you define it. It's catchy danceable has strong lyrics and vocals and an incredible moral to it. It's only shortcoming in my eyes is that it has suffered from over exposure the way that all popular artist's singles eventually do. 5/5.3. Government Hooker- Not one of my personal favorites. I like it but in comparison to the rest of the songs on the album I'm not crazy about it. It's a good song catchy provocative good for the dance floor. The vocals aren't lacking but they aren't as strong as on other tracks. I think this song may be an acquired taste because it has grown on me more as I've listened to it again and again. 4.5/54. Judas- As much buzz as this song created before it even premiered I was expecting something incredibly controversial. But when I heard it I barely even raised an eyebrow. I didn't find it offensive at all. What I did find it was catchy another fun single from Lady Gaga. Vocals are reminiscent of ""Boys Boys Boys"" and ""The Fame"" mixed with ""Alejandro"". It's not my all-time favorite but it's probably in the top 5. 5/5.5. Americano- I wish I could say otherwise but I just don't like this song at all. There's nothing really wrong with it it's just not my personal taste. It's very Spanish/Italian it has an exotic European feel to it and it's catchy easy to dance to. I think this one is a matter of taste and unfortunately it just isn't quite to my liking. Still there's nothing technically wrong with it alright vocals not as strong as the other songs but still acceptable. 3/5.6. Hair- Personal all-time favorite. Catchy tune relatable lyrics and great vocals it's a dance song but it features some great strong vocal moments from Gaga especially toward the end. Gaga of course has her own sound but when I heard it something in the back of my mind went to Cher. I think there's definitely something in here reminiscent of a song like ""Believe"". Whether you agree or not I love this song and I'm so glad it's a single. 5/5.7. Scheibe- At first I couldn't make heads or tales of this song. I like German but I was iffy on the intro. The rest of the song is thoroughly enjoyable. I do like the song but I feel like I'm more inclined to listen to it if I'm in a certain mood. Of course another decent dance track and the lyrics are good vocals are nothing to sneeze at. Sort of middle of the road for me. 4/5.8. Bloody Mary- This one takes a while to get going but once it does it is a very enjoyable song. Not my favorite it's a bit repetitive and the vocals aren't as impressive on this one as on other tracks but it's a nice mid-tempo song not as dancey as the others but enjoyable in it's own right. 4/5.9. Bad Kids- Another relatable song. For anyone who's ever felt like a ""bad kid"" whatever you and those around you define that as this song tells you that ""you're still a good kid"" to Gaga even if you're a bad kid. The lyrics and tune remind me a bit of Madonna to be honest at least in the chorus. I am forever quoting this song and it's definitely on my list of favorites. 5/5.10. Unicorn Highway (Road to Love)- One of the more epic songs on the album. All you have to do is listen to it to know what I mean. This is one of those songs that they play for Pay-Per-View commercials when they televise a commercial complete with clips of screaming fans and grand entrances. If this doesn't become a single I'll be a bit disappointed. It's also another very empowering song encouraging you and telling you that ""we can be strong"" on the road to love. Another one of my personal favorites. 5/5.11. Heavy Metal Lover- Another one I'm not so keen for. It's just a bit whispery for my liking though it's nowhere near as off-putting as ""Americano"". It actually sounds more like a La Roux song than a Lady Gaga song. Definitely not a personal favorite. 3.5/512. Electric Chapel- I do like the electric guitar in the beginning. The sound on this one is big. It's a song that would be good for dance parties and the vocals though not weak go from different levels of strength as the song goes on. Another middle-of-the-road track in my mind. 4/5.13. You and I- This track is another great one. It has a great rock feel to it and the vocals on this song are probably the strongest on the album. It's a love song but it just has this real great rock sound. If you only listen to a few songs off the album make this one of them. Definite favorite. 5/5.14. The Edge of Glory- Talk about ending the album with a bang! This is probably THE most epic song on the album complete with strong vocals a great dance beat heartbeat songs definitely a prom/wedding/NYE dance song. The lyrics are beautiful they make me feel energetic and lighthearted and in my opinion this is the perfect song to end the album with. 5/5.Cheesy though it sounds I give this album a 10/10 rating. It's everything I wanted and more. Lady Gaga delivered with this latest gift of music and now I can't wait until some far-off day when I can finally afford to go to one of her concerts. If I was just a fan before I'm a Little Monster for life now and there's no stopping me. I was born this way baby!"
Madonna redux but with less interesting music.  I downloaded this for 99 cents and well that's about how much it's worth in my music rotation.  Gaga uses the term disenfranchised a lot.  Right.  She is a franchise.  She needs to enjoy it and capitalize on it as best she can.  If she continues this derivative mediocre club music for the masses sound she will fizzle a bit faster than Madonna and Brittany did.
Thank you so much to Amazon for listing this at 99 cents yesterday.  I must admit I was getting worried that I would only have 3 songs but you know what 3 for 99 cents is still a deal.  I woke up today and 24 hours later I have the whole album which is surprising and awesome considering how many people were having trouble yesterday.  Still the product is out of this world. It took me a long time to get to Gaga and now that I'm in it I can't stop. She is on top of her game passionate creative and a wonderful artist.  This album is blowing my mind.
I've heard this album several times haven't bought it yet but it's free on farmville and you can also hear it at Starbucks today if you want to see if you like it before you buy. At first I didn't like it much but after listening to it several times it has grown on me. Not as good as her previous album but OK as a follow up. Nothing she does shocks me because you expect that from her. If you are a Gaga fan you'll probably like this album. I like Marry the night and Electric chapel the best.Downloading it now got 2 songs so far...it's slow but expected when so many people are doing it at the same time.
there were a few songs I really liked but many that I did not. was not really happy with this buy
it has some good songs but Lady Gaga is getting a little too much for my tastes. She's old news.
Like many others I was thrilled to download this album for $1! However I only got 4-5 songs the rest are not available! This isn't very fair. I see that others are having this problem but some even got 8 songs thats more than I got and we all paid the same price. Very disappointed!
Nice dance album great songs but nothing that we will listen to 20 years from now like Madonna more like the Party Monster soundtrack. fun songs though.
In case you didn't know Lady Gaga wrote or co-wrote as long as co-produced EACH song on this album. I feel many of the 1 star reviews are from bitter Britney Spears fans who are afraid she might break her record for the most albums sold in a week by a female artist. Well so what? Britney had her moment and now let Gaga have hers! I think the only song on this album I don't like is Americano and that is only after one listen.
.99 What a fantastic deal and what a sincere nice thing to do  for all of us little monsters even the ones in our 50 s!!!this album is absolutely BRILLIANT!!Lady Ga Ga's voice is simply breath -taking the lyrics are personal  pure and as always thought provoking   she is sharing her TRUE-SELF with all of us . PUT YOUR PAWS UP !!
Great songs that have a good modern beat. She is a bit outrageous at times but most of the songs are catchy.
"I was actually a bit unsure about this album as I wasn't too into ""Born this way"" when it was first released. I decided to give it a try anyway and I'm actually glad I did. It seems like a combination between '80s pop lots of techno and a wee bit of eurotrash. It's censored of course although there isn't much cursing in this album so it's not distracting--or perhaps Lady GaGa decided to exploit the censor beep into her techno beats but I think maybe I'm being too hopeful with that. It's definitely different in sound from her previous albums although I think it's a logical next step in the progression her music seems to be making so if you're expecting the same-ol'-same-ol' you may be disappointed. Approach it with an open mind however and I think you may like it too. This is really a pretty enjoyable album especially if you like electronic music.The digital booklet by the way is really neat. It's basically just the insert that comes with when you buy a CD so I really appreciate that she thought to include that with her MP3 release when she didn't have to.ETA: Now that I've listened to the album a good dozen or so times I LOVE it! I have also thought of a good taste gauge: if you like the music used for DDR games especially the older ones you will probably love this album also. (Not that you won't like it if you don't like DDR but that's what it reminds me of a little.)"
I purchased on Monday when it came out the first time and it took a day to download completely but totally worth it.
I listened a couple times through and then gave up.  This album has one good song and a dozen other rehashes of the same material from her last album.  The sum total of her singing talent appears to be nothing more than stuttering out a few cliche phrases.  After that she just applies a few musical style templates to create a handful of cookie-cutter songs.  Voila a new Lady Gaga album is born (this way).
"Like a lot of people I picked up this album when it was up for 99 cents on the day of release. I felt it was a good opportunity to try to understand what's up with this Lady Gaga thing. I had read her interview in Rolling Stone and came away mildly intrigued but really came to this album a blank slate -- not having heard Lady Gaga's music but willing to like it with a vaguely positive predisposition.But what struck me most about the record is its surprising lack of originality. Except for a few more ballad-like tracks at the end most of the music is dominated by techno-style rhythm tracks that you would have heard in any European dance club in 1995 (which is about when I stopped going to clubs).People compare Lady Gaga to Madonna a lot and I can understand why -- the title track ""Born This Way"" is basically a remake of Madonna's ""Express Yourself"" with a little bit of the rap from ""Vogue"" thrown in. But Madonna has actually done some innovative things musically -- the ""Like a Prayer"" album still stands out as a pretty decent achievement for example. I'm not hearing anything of that caliber here.Lady Gaga seems to have two things going for her. First she is an innovator at least a bit on the look-and-image side. Can't take that away from her. Second are her religion-themed lyrics. I still can't make out whether she is coming from a Christian angle or an angle critical of mainstream Christianity. This ambivalence is mildly interesting artistically.Otherwise the music is OK for what it is -- relatively mindless and uninventive dance fodder. But I don't think you can say much beyond that. To paraphrase what Gertrude Stein said about Oakland California: ""There's not much there there."""
or should I say i didn't like lady gaga very much till i got this cd.  it's awesome!  I love nearly every song on it.  they're all very unique and very catchy.  Good stuff!!!!!!!!
"I hate most of todays pop music but every once and then there are a few songs or artist that come along with some catchy songs and grab my attention. I am not a big Ga-Ga fan in fact I am not very familar with most of her material but I have heard some of her other releases and some of it is pretty good. Some is over the top cheese for me but she has a good voice and uses some interesting samples and grooves that are very catchy. I downloaded this release thinking that I could always just dump some of the songs I didnt want but I wound up dumping all but ONE song. Folks this is a very bad effort. I dont know what she was thinking but this all seems ""Rushed"" Every single track seems to use the same beat or sample and the vocal seems like it it 10x oversampled with the I just ran my great voice through a vocal processor so know it sounds like almost everyone else that does it in the world of todays pop. With a huge fan base and albums that fly off the shelves why this? Why does this seem like its dumbed down and sounds like most of todays garbage. I guess everyone is entitled to have bad albums. Some greats have had some duds like Led Zeppelin and the Who but..at least you could get some good songs off the bad albums this is just B.A.D...and I am hoping that Lady doesnt decide to go with this style for her next albums. She's got some talent no doubt but thsi is just wasted..Avoid this your not missing anything here at all."
THIS ALBUM IS PURE PERFECTION. SHE DID SUCH A WONDERFUL JOB ON IT IM SO PROUD OF HER. i SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO AT LEAST TWO OF HER SONG EVERYDAY I LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!
"You wont be running out and telling your friends that ""they must listen"" to this album. That pretty much tells you that this album is not horrible but it's not great. There isn't a single song on here as good as her smash singles from her last album (which was only good for those said singles). The tracks just sounds the same as you move down the LP and I found myself singing the lyrics and melodies of her past smash singles over these new tracks except for the fact that these new tracks arent as good as those past singles. Her fans will be loyally blind to her I am sure but for anyone with objective taste you can't say that this album has anything truly memorable like her past two projects. There's a reason why her singles aren't charting and running the Hot 100 like Just Dance Poker Face etc..."
I love every song on this album. I love how every song tells like some type of story. Many of them are inspirational. I'm very impressed. I seriously recommend buying this album.
Before this album was released Lady GaGa said that this album would be alot different than the others she had previously put out. Something i was a bit scared about. I (we & you) love our pop diva. But i knew no matter what this album would be good and it was. The album has such a wide range of styles and i really enjoyed it.
"Ill say this.I first listened too this album and i had some songs i loved and other i just disliked.But i didn't want too give it a bad review right off the bat.So i waited about a week and would see how i liked it then.&I have decided that this album is a amazing album.This is a well balanced album all around.Its catchy the tracks flow almost perfectly.Great driving music and very uplifting ""in my opinion""*my pointMy biggest problem right now has noting too do with the album.It has everything too do with the fans.I don't understand that people just don't get the fact that musicians change their music their constantly developing into who they are and want to try out new things.This might not be the huge fame monster that everyone was expecting.And what really bugs me is i know for a fact that if she made this album into another fame monster pretty much exactly the same people would complain and whine just like there doing with this album.I guess what im saying is give it a chance go in with a open mind.&you going to find you will love this album."
I purchased my download and it took 5 and a half hours...As for Ms. Gaga I will continue to support you by purchasing future albums.
The hassle with Amazon's MP3 Downloader were not worth the price. Amazon's tagline that they are building the best customer service in the world should be accompanied by a note stating that it is still under construction.Downloader didnt work.  Help material hard to find and unhelpful.Says click here and Amazon will call you. They do call immediately but it does no good because then they leave you dangling on hold without so much as a time estimate.Gave up and emailed a help request. Took 15 hours but I eventually got an email response.  It had new instructions and not a word about their server failure. The instructions seem to have worked but I doubt I'll be back.  Too much headache. Long ways to go in terms of understanding customer needs server failure or not.
WOW! That's all I could say when I listened to Born This Way for the first time. This album is so deep and special for Gaga and for all of us Monsters. Every track from Marry The Night all the way to The Edge of Glory has its own meaning and message. Gaga really put a lot of time and work into this record and it shows. There are heavy dark dance beats (Schei&szlig;e Judas) and fun sing-along stadium tracks (Yo&uuml; and I). If you're a fan of Pop music and thinking about buying this album do not wait any longer! It's worth every penny! Paws up!
"... This is the album of the decade (at least in my opinion). Sure you can read this and think that I'm just another delusional Gaga fan but hear me out. The church bells in Marry The Night the demonic voice is Bloody Mary the wonderful use of actual instruments in the songs- This is such an innovative record that is sure to set the lead for many pop acts to follow. Really looking at it listening to it Gaga's lyrics have grown and still hold the special meanings inside them; the music is still revolutionary; the production is just fantastic. All in all I think this is an enjoyable pop record not just for Monsters but also for the casual pop music fan.Standout Tracks:Marry The Night- The church bells added with the lyrics are legendary! This song is fantastic!Schei&szlig;e- ""If you're a strong female you don't need permission"". Words to live by along with a kickass chorus.Highway Unicorn (Road To Love)- How many people could relase a song with the word Unicorn in the title and have it be amazing?Heavy Metal Lover- The ""Oooo ooo oo oooo oooo Heavy Metal Lover"" chorus is phenomenal.The Edge of Glory- One of my favorites from the first time I heard it. This is just a SMASH the first time you hear it."
What a great way to start your cloud drive-20 Gigs for only 99 cents. However only one song downloaded! What's up with that? Not a great way to premier your new cloud service. I guess time will tell if the other songs become available but I am not impressed so far.
I don't usually listen to the radio stations that play Lady GaGa type music so this .99 cent trial for the whole album was $ well spent. While not something I will play every single day this is easy to listen to. The .99 cent promo was a great idea to get new listeners & reward the loyal fan base.
I really wanted to like this album but sadly it's just plain awful. All but two songs are worth listening to - Born This Way and Judas but that's because we've heard them before. Born This Way is a reworked version of Respect Yourself (Madonna) and Judas sounds an awful lot like Bad Romance. It's not like GaGa doesn't have the smarts or the ability. This album suffers from expectations that were set too high a hype machine that's tired and out of gas and a production team that peaked and then floundered in the 80's (and should have been left there). Let's just hope that this is the nadir of Gaga's career and that she can claw her way back to the top.
Absolutely love this album. It is so relatable. Songs are upbeat and I dont get tired of this album the way I do other ones. I have been listening to this album and its many moods for a long while now. About three years. Still love it. !
Its just typical disposable assembly line techno pop music. There wasn't a single track on this thing that I wanted to listen to a second time.
I prefer my albums to be thought of as a single large unit. This is really a collection of singles. For what I paid not bad but I would have been upset had I spent $10.
More mouse music sung by a chipmunk on Helium. Couldn't the music machine find a less creative format than boom boom boom and chipmunks?
I have no complaints about this album nope none at all. I love Lady Gaga & her music. Another great album.
I really liked Lady Gaga's first album and had high hopes for her second album.  The album is kind of lack luster besides the few singles they play on the radio.  I don't really listen to this album even though it's on my iPhone.  The only reason I purchased the album was because amazon was pretty much giving it away for $1 how could I pass that up?  Definitely would not have payed full price.
"I would like to explain why I'm disappointed in Lady Gaga's latest release.I grew up in the 1980s. I can remember an interview with Freddie Mercury in which he was asked about Queen's formerly outrageous get ups. In the 1970s Queen needed something that would get them noticed and wild costumes and makeup accomplished the task. However behind the costumes and makeup was an immensely talented band. Queen delivered the goods time after time and eventually what the band looked like did not matter. Freddie stated that he knew he and his band mates looked ridiculous but their ability to create music could win people over. This was the case with many talented artists of the 1970s and 1980s. Prince Grace Jones Cyndi Lauper and Michael Jackson all had an element of  ""strangeness"" to them yet their talent was able to overshadow that element (expect for later in MJ's career).Sadly what Lady Gaga has delivered in Born this Way is style over substance. When Gaga debuted The Fame she delivered a style of popular music which had not been seen since the 1980s. It was catchy one could dance to it and Gaga did something most singers cannot do any more-- she sang! Not only did she sing on the album but also she dared to sing live in concert and did it well. Each track on The Fame seemed to be its own creation. So well planned and construed the artist's talent could not be over looked. Lady Gaga ruled the charts in 2008 and she continued her reign the following year with the release of The Fame Monster. ""Bad Romance"" is easily one of the greatest dance/pop songs recorded by any artist and the album was filled with another batch of great songs. Clearly her image was a marketing ploy yet Gaga had proven herself worthy of being called a star. Yet the focus and talent Gaga delivered on her previous efforts is missing on Born this Way.The album starts off well enough with ""Marry the Night"" which is an all right song if one is into the club scene and doesn't care to appreciate an artist's singing abilities. The title track is a given and I admit I'm quite fond of it. However after that the album goes down hill at a rate I could not have anticipated. The endless thumping on every single track was overwhelming to say the least and the ballads were so lack luster I'm not sure what purpose they served. In short this is not the type of album I would expect a proven artist to deliver so early in her career. Born this Way seems to be more about the artist's ego than anything else... It seems Lady Gaga's fame (i.e. being strange) is more important to her than showcasing her musical abilities.SincerelyA Former Little Monster"
"Lady Gaga is a product of delicious kitschy wretched excess. She wallows in it like a bubble bath. She throws it into the air like so many bags of glitter and confetti. If there's something flashy she lunges it for it before anyone else even sees a flicker. And more to the point she makes absolutely no apologies for madly passionately being in love with what she's creating and the ingredients she is building her home for Little Monsters from. This is what make Lady Gaga and her ""Born This Way"" so lovable.Like Madonna Elton John or even David Bowie before her Gaga spares no excess when it comes to her music. Does she want to emulate Springsteen? Then not only will there be a sax solo Clarence Clemmons himself is going to play it (""Hair"" ""Edge Of Glory""). Does she think Madonna's expression of Catholic guilt on ""Like a Prayer"" was a high point of 80's dance music? Then ""Judas"" and ""Black Jesus"" are where it's really at for the 2010's. That cover image of Gaga as a human motorcycle is no accident either. To meet that expectation she gives herself up to her ""Heavy Metal Lover"" and then mashes cute girly kitsch with a road-warrior meme on ""Highway Unicorn."" There's nothing Gaga won't try nor any room for subtleties.The bonus disc proves this point even more by including the ""country road"" version of the title track. (The other tracks are useless remixes). Gaga is as calculating and cunning as she is creative and wild. The song ""Born This Way"" references Madonna's ""Express Yourself"" ""The Queen"" (one of the deluxe edition's extra tracks) references Queen's ""Killer Queen"" and ""The Edge Of Glory"" -  along with the title song my favorite on the album - takes its cues from all those 80's Bon Jovi and Springsteen anthems. The Mother Monster knows that this is her moment and she's using it to both pay tribute to all the influences that came before her as well as establish that she is every bit their creative equal. That's what makes ""Born This Way"" a terrific pop album and Lady Gaga herself such a fascinating artist."
"Gaga's attempt to do something ""different"" is basically a mess of cliche done before songs that are mediocre at best.  It's kind of like a Cyndi Lauper on crack CD."
Is there anything more to say.  She is more than an entertainer she is a phenomena.  I love her creativity.
"I was expecting something spectacular and it deliveres this music does show GaGa's vocal talents.  Where the fame monster was more dark this is all about hope in oneself and believing who you are some may think that is corny but who cares.  The song ""You and I"" is my favorite for the reason you can feel the emotional power of not only the music but of GaGa's singing oozing out of your speakers.  The only thing I wish was on the album was the beautiful acapella version of Born This Way we saw at the end of the HBO concert this proves to all you skeptics that she is the real thing no studio voice and I hope she is around inspiring the world for a long time!"
I am one of the people who was discriminate of Lady Gaga based on what she wears but I decided that I would purchase her album after all the good reviews I had heard. To my surprised I did not like this album at all! I paid .99 cents for the whole album which is the only reason I purchased it but I feel like I got ripped of...  Maybe a Lady Gaga fan would like it but as for me I do not.
BTW is without question the best pop album I've heard in many many years. Multiple tracks are single worthy in addition to BTW Judas and The Edge of Glory including Hair SheiBe Heavy Metal Lover and possibly Marry The Night. Bloody Mary gave me chills! The beats are sick. The vocals are stellar. Gaga has songwriting chops in spades!!! I highly recommend this body of work.
"For all the Little Monsters around the world May 23 2011 couldn't arrive soon enough. Yes kids Lady GaGa's full length CD ""Born This Way"" has finally hit the shelves of your record retail store.The fix is in. I have to admit I am one of the Little Monsters who has been waiting for this release. That being said the journalist in me did remain a bit skeptical on how good the CD would really turn out to be. Would it exceed all expectations and become an even bigger success than her ""Fame Monster?"" Yes the answer is a resounding it just might. Though I'm not a mind reader or fortune teller I'll go out on a limb and say ""Born This Way"" will enter the Billboard Chart next week at Number 1. I would be shocked if this isn't the case.There are two versions of ""Born This Way."" The first release is a Special Edition 2 disc set. The first CD contains 17 tracks. Disc two boasts 5 remixes including 'Born This Way' 'Judas''Marry The Night' 'Schdibe"" and 'Fashion Of His Love.' Don't worry I'm not going to bore you with a lengthily song by song synopsis. What I will say is ""Born This Way"" is an excellent release; doesn't have one bad or mediorchior song in the bunch. It is a strong dance release that contains endless hit single releases. Still a rocker until the end I have not thrown in the towel and joined the high energy dance club. Give me an electric guitar over a sync drum anytime. There is something here for everyone. Turn up the volume to 10. I'm sure even the health clubs will be cranked into this release so get ready spinning and cardio classes. GaGa's voice is a natural wonder. No studio magic here on the vocals. I should know I've seen her live. The woman CAN sing. Co-writing all 17 tracks she showcases more of her talent on this release. She's not merely a one-trick-pony. There's a lot more here than meets the eye or ears. Is she the greatest songwriter ever to grace the blank page? Of course not. Is she imaginative to come up with infectious hooks and choruses; absolutely. This release is proof positive she's not just another pop star who wears outrageous clothes steals the spotlight and basks in all the hoopla she's surrounded with.'Born This Way' starts out incredibly strong with ""Marry The Night"" and never lets up until the very last chord is played 17 tracks later. Of course the singles ""Born This Way"" and ""Judas"" resound with incredible sound and passion. There are other gems in the fold. ""Hair"" ""Bloody Mary"" (a great Goth-esque tune) ""You And I"" (produced by ""Mutt"" Lange guitar solo by Queen's Brian May) and the ""Edge Of Glory"" (Clarence Clemmons sax solo is right on target) are all superb. ""Americano"" with its LA/Mexican influence is great and sure to light a fire in your local dance club. "" ScheiYe"" is without a doubt one of the most unusual songs on the CD. Starting out in German (who knew GaGa spoke a bit of the language) still turns the corner into a groove that is undeniable. One might be surprised at the religious undertone of a number of the tracks on the release. I don't find anything inflammatory here. In fact the imagery is wonderful and the church choir chorus effects are inspiring. Perhaps that's just my perspective. Those detractors will always find what they wish to find and make mountains out of molehills. It's just Entertainment folks. Back to the review: I do have to say in regards to the second disc I really would have loved GaGa to include the acoustic versions (solo piano) of ""You And I"" and ""The Edge Of Glory."" Seeing her perform these live I can honestly say they were highlights of the show and very moving.I guess the ultimate question remains: Will 'Born The Way' surpass the mega colossal selling ""Fame Monster?"" If the initial buzz and publicity is any indication the answer without a doubt is YES. It is impossible to miss GaGa is week. Just turn on your television she's on every show imaginable. From Oprah The View David Letterman SNL Good Morning America possibly the finale of American Idol (right now that's a strong rumor) and countless others the promo train keeps on a rolling. Little Monsters take heed ""Born This Way"" is truly the release we've all been waiting for. This release is going to be around and running strong for a long time to come. I can't wait for the follow-up videos certain to come."
Awesome album! Every song is Lady Gaga at her best.If you're thinking about getting the $0.99 version note that it is a promotion for Amazon Cloud playerand YOU WON'T RECEIVE YOUR SONGS FOR UP TO 3 HOURS unless you download their cloud player.That is all! Get this version! :D
Lady Gaga id a great musician and delivers a solid energetic fully dancable album and combines with amazon so that you can get it for pennies. Class move and great album!
better than i expected from her bc i dont generally like her but a pretty good album all the way through
When I first heard The Fame I was with my dads girlfriend and LOVED it. Then the fame monster cameout and I loved it for awhile but grew tired of it. With born this way I loved half the album and then grew tired of it. She's going too far trying to put herself out ther rather than sticking to herself.Bornthisway is an album full of good songs but nothing great. The lead track was horrible.
Gaga has done it again.  This record is pure genius the amount of different styles is great but it somehow remains cohesive.  It also crosses cultures and has such powerful messages.  Happy Born This Way Day!  99 cents you cannot beat that! (I got a hard copy as well though!).
I have to say it's a disappointing release.  It's just standard dance fare - the songs start running together and sounding the same after the 2nd song.  If it weren't for LG singing each song I would have guessed it as a dance sampler.  Some of the choruses I've heard her use on other songs.  Many of the recording techniques and sound effects are commonly used by other dance artists today. I've listened to it 3 times now and there's not any one song that really jumps out. I really like LG - think she's a terrifically talented lady who has her act together. But for whatever reason the innovative and catchy songs that made her last release a multi-platinum seller aren't here with this one.  I have to give both LG and AMZ props for putting this out for .99 cents - helluva marketing scheme and much appreciated.  But in the long run I'm glad I didn't pay more than that.
"First off I did buy this on the original release day to hop on the bandwagon of getting it for $0.99 . I had no intentions of getting the bonus tracks but after getting the album for so cheap I listened to the bonus tracks to see if they were worthwhile. To my amazement they were and so I bought them as well. The download process took place over a course of 8 hours from the time of hitting the purchase button. Their servers were clogged - what do people expect when an album is the price of a song? It was a great scheme of getting people to try Amazon's MP3 service but implementation may not have been handled as well as it could have been but for me I understand.From first glance I was a little skeptical as it seemed like the tracks were all over the place in their beats and lyrics. However after listening more closely I saw the fluid message that flowed from one song to another. The album is about empowerment self affirmation and loving yourself (along with elements of knowing God loves you too only without making it religious-like).The use of upbeat tempos along with some slower ballads were well done. The major difference in this album is that she utilizes synthesizers much more than the 2 previous albums. Also the piano solos are more scarce than previously; instead this gets replaced with saxophone and guitar solos - I'm indifferent to this. If I could point out tracks that I will definitely be listening to for a while they would be: Marry the Night Government Hooker Judas Schei&szlig;e Bloody Mary and Heavy Metal Lover - the other ones I'll listen to but I could foresee them falling out of my playlist a lot sooner.Overall I'd say it was well done but the one part that I miss the most were the simple ballads of her singing with just a piano. She sings really well acoustically and I think that element got left behind. The track ""You and I"" does have major elements of piano playing but it gets lost in certain parts because of the guitar; is it just me or did this song remind you of a style similar to Shania Twain? This album is certainly more rock-ish than the previous ones but not too over the top. I gave the album a 4 out of 5 star rating because of the lacking of piano acoustics hurt it in a way to me. However if she did make an acoustic version of this album perhaps then I'd be more forgiving and bumping it to 5 stars."
This is one heck of an album. I admit it's not for everyone. Even those who loved her first couple of cd's may not completely love this.Is it overproduced? Sure. But it works.And it just gets better and better with repeat listenings.
This album is awesome. It contains 8 more tracks than the original edition. Which are: Black JesusAmen Fashion Fashion of His Love The Queen Born This Way-Remix Judas-Remix Marry The Night-Remix ScheiBe-Remix and Fashion of His Love-Remix. As a fan of Lady Gaga this is the must have album. I have both orig and Special Edition. The songs are GREAT and unique in their own way.
Great album great price great way to get it.  Downloaded directly into iTunes in 2 minutes.  Good job Gaga and Amazon.
"Yes 99 for an entire album is a bargain from an economic point of view. But when the music is this bad is it really a good deal? I submit ""NO!"" Bad disco is still bad no matter how cheap it's offered. Better to spend that 99 on one good song than throw it away on junk."
I love lady Gaga!  Most of the songs are upbeat and fun.  The first album was definitely the best but this is good also.
I pre-ordered this before the fact i knew it was gonna be 99cents on Amazon Mp3 download haha.. but i like the physical CDs when it comes to buying music.My personal feelings for this... I love the new sounds that Lady Gaga plays with... with some songs that i TOTALLY love (judas born this way bloody mary americano) and others that i took me a little bit to really get into. I think its not as addicting as the FAME MONSTER album.. but I still really enjoy it!.LOVE YOU GAGA! man i want to see her in concert! heard it's epic :)
I cannot ask for more. This woman is brilliant! like Tony Bennett said she is America's Picasso! She has a great voice. She is talented. She is very creative! So proud of her!
I was skeptical at first when she came out wow she really turned me around  now i love her music.I have every CD so far.And she has a great story to tell of her life & how it enfluences a lot of people.
I love this album has a mix of sounds and lots of great club tracks.  She really is the best popstar out right now.
I'm Gaga's fan in China love her so much and I bought this amazing CD at amazon to support GaGa. The international standard shipping is really fast and inexpensive it only took 10 days to ship to China. Great!
I am so disappointed!  The title track of this CD skips like crazy.  I should have purchased it at a local store.  What is my recourse now?  I have never had this type of problem from Amazon!
The only thing I can say about it is that it was free and my wife likes a song or two from it.
"There's a late 80s/early 90s aesthetic to most of the songs that makes them feel familiar even on the first listen and there's no mistaking Lady Gaga's intentions of being inflammatory.  Her activism on LGBT rights is well documented and on full display on the title track but the dominant theme of this album is religion.  Throughout Born This Way Lady Gaga takes aim at kneejerk bible thumpers as well--though her jabs are actually more thoughtful and subtle than I'm sure will be recognized once they're introduced to the crowd who has no room for any interpretation of Scripture that isn't their own.The best microcosm for this album is ""Judas"" in which Gaga sings of her devotion to the man who betrayed Christ to the Romans.  ""Jesus is my virtue/Judas is the demon I cling to"" she concludes.  Is the song meant to denounce Christ or merely antagonize those who shield their bigotry and hatred behind the Bible?  Hard to say but I think there's at least one more valid interpretation worth considering: that Lady Gaga is exploring the fact that we're all sinners.  No matter how devout you may be if you're really honest with yourself you can admit to having betrayed Christ in your own ways over the years.  In this context then ""Judas"" isn't as sacrilegious as it may appear at first blanch but rather a sincere discussion of faith.  Of course the very audience who might stand to learn something from ""Judas"" will renounce it the moment they hear about it passing judgment on the superficial rather than the actual nature of the song.Which brings me to the larger issue with Born This Way: Lady Gaga knows the world is paying attention to her so one has to ask why she would feel the need to bait such a backlash in the first place.  Could she not have written and recorded a song about how we all fall short of our spiritual ideals that doesn't appear to be a love letter to the most notorious back-stabber of all time?  Wouldn't her very celebrity ensure that such a more modest song would still have found an audience and resonated?  The problem this creates in me as a listener is that I feel that these songs were created for the sake of instigating controversy not to raise awareness of anything but for the sake of controversy itself.  It feels calculated which I fear detracts from the otherwise legitimate arguments espoused throughout these fourteen songs."
"This review also appears on Epinions!Pros: NothingCons: Lyrics musicianship cheap production repetitive and uninspired melodies comparing of gay people to monsters and freaks offensive religiously inaccurate and just plain old boring.I avoided this album like it was musical cancer. Not because I was afraid of liking it. But rather because I just didn't want to have to listen to it. I listened with open ears and an open mind and wondered whether or not Born This Way would have any sort of substance to it. Firstly does it live up to GaGa's debut record which can be regarded as her version of She's So Unusual. Well no it does not. And that isn't saying much. Frankly stated Born This Way is so bad that we need a new word for bad. It is not bad because of the way she dresses; it is not bad because of the fact that she gave the album away with proof of purchase of coffees game cards or cellphones; it is not bad because it premiered on a Facebook game: it is bad because the songwriting is very hollow uninspired and generally lazy. It is bad because the melodies are boring and plagiarized. It is bad because it is simply not memorable or catchy. It's difficult to continually give one one-star ratings to Lady GaGa's music-it's just what's expected of me. But I hope people read this review and find the merit behind it. I genuinely did not like this album and I still have no clue why people eat her up.The hype of this record must first be address. Before promotion for The Fame Monster was over little bits of information about this new album began to surface. It was hyped as being the album of the decade-of the century even and we should all be paying attention. But much like anybody under that amount of pressure they aren't able to deliver. This was true of Cyndi Lauper and it was true of Alanis Morissette. And thus it happened to Lady GaGa as well. Unlike on her first album GaGa truly took a whiff of herself and began to believe that she was the second-coming of Madonna. And as a result the first single released from Born This Way the anthem-esque title-track was a direct rip-off of one of Madonna's better known singles. Except this time people noticed the correlation between her and Madonna and it wasn't positive. Was the song a hit? Yes. Was it a monster? (No pun intended-I wonder why she wasn't selected to be on Kanye's Monster). No. In fact I would barely call it a success. It set the tone for the rest of the album though: bad lyrics repeated more than anything on a Police song (and Sting loves to repeat himself). Its follow-up was Judas another uninspired song that tries too hard to take it to the next level. Really in a world where Madonna has done it all before it was just a new middle. Not to mention the fact that her take on Mary Magdalene's story is wickedly inaccurate-for the record MARY MAGDALENE WAS NOT A WHORE; SHE WAS AN APOSTLE.But the singles didn't get real insight into the rest of the record which is very very long. But long doesn't equal quality. Rather than focusing on anything I would call an earworm GaGa released a bunch of mediocre haphazard tracks without any meat to them. Heavy Metal Lover has an industrial production that sounds more like tin than steel and ballad You and I has a decent ending but a bland opening and middle. Most if not all of the songs on this record never go anywhere. They want to be showstoppers but none of them are the least-bit impressive. The song Schei&szlig;e which is German for what you do in the bathroom offends my ears and my brain with its gibberish introduction and mind-numbingly bad chorus and outside of Bloody Mary which has a brooding melody to it there's nothing I would want to hear more than once. Lady GaGa seems content to waltz down the road that Madonna Grace Jones and Dale Bozzio had already carved out all the while bringing nothing new to the table. She is not edgy and she is not that interesting. But one thing that really annoys me is the way she seems to think she's the Queen of Homosexuals-she knows almost nothing about gay culture and the struggle we endure day-in-and-day-out. There is not a day that doesn't pass where we don't feel a little one morsel of shame or torture particularly living in America. And songs that pander like Born This Way just make me feel like a spoon-fed baby without a choice. A friend of mine recently posted to his Facebook wall that all gay people are monsters. When verbally slaughtered by his other friends he responded with ""My name is Lady GaGa and this is my message."" And he was right. Her lowering of homosexuals to mere freaks and monsterw and outsiders is not helping the cause but only serving to destroy it. By the time the seventeen songs are finished you will only feel underwhelmed slightly bored and very very sleepy. GaGa's voice croaks and roars like a kitten trying to be a lion as her desperate grasp onto her fame begins to slowly and silently erode."
"Wow after reading the lyrics in the digital booklet I cannot find anything commendable about this album. It's Gaga so I didn't expect it to be ""uplifting"" per se I just didn't expect it to be this bad. I wish I could say there was at least one song I liked to justify the 99 cents but at least it's only a buck down the drain. Can't be too disappointed over a wasted dollar."
This is one of the best deals I have seen on Amazon ever and I have been a fan for years!!!  The CD is not all that but for the price you really con't lose!!!!
Never knew of any star so humble. I full heartedly support her!!! She gives so much back fighting for equal rights and being a strong supporter of &#34;you are born this way&#34; -and we all have gifts. She doesnt care!! And neither should your neighbor as long as you are not hurting someone else. Yes she has weird outfits uncanny music videos etc but she does this out of artistic expression. All her songs are fantastic so this is worth the purchase. I can't think of a song I dont like.
There are edgy avant-garde rhythms and there are also retro/80's references. Catchy melodies and positive messages. Lots of variety and potential singles. Quite amazing that she wrote and composed everything herself and even co-produced the tracks. Without a doubt her best album so far.
I must say I am biased. I think Lady Gaga is THE most talented songwriter to come along since Tori Amos. (And if you knew how much I worship Tori Amos that is saying alot) Born This Way is all at once; Sexy Fun Pop Dark Haunting Freeing Enlightening Brilliant Insightful Educational and completely addicting. I have to have listened to this album several hundred times already. I highly suggest you buy it NOW! Seriously!!
probably one of the best albums released in the past ten years...amazing!  Watch out...she's going to get all the grammies this year!
I was ready to be disappointed.  However even right off the bat there are several tracks that are easy to like.  After a time or two through the whole disc no doubt you'll be loving even more!  LOVE IT!
Amazon way to go on giving me 1 song. Great job being prepared to support your promo. I hope Engadget Gizmodo and Crave post this crap up fast.
All in all i did enjoy this album and i do like lady gaga's music some of the songs are horribly catchy and i like listening to them. i just have a slight problem with the fact that some of the songs are censored it just makes it weird to listen to. what i found most strange though is the fact that their is a whole part of the song Bad Kids that was apparently left out...if you look in the booklet there's lyrics for like a whole verse at the end of the song thats not in the song....i just thought that was weird...was it maybe just the download version? i don't know
I loved this album even though I don't like Lady Gaga as a performer. I love her as a musician. Fun songs!
Bought this album for $1 when it was on sale. Love Lady Gaga great songs. But the real perk and reason I bought the $1 album was to gain access to Amazon's Cloud Drive Benefits they were offering at the time. If you support the artist buy the music instead of going to the torrents.
Every song from start to finish is a piece of art. It is such an enjoyable timeless album. Each song lends itself to the next and the entire album is a cohesive piece of work. What a mature step in the right direction as Lady Gaga is quickly becoming the true artist of a generation.
It's an amazing CD and I just wish people could see past her clothes and not judge her (very 1990s of those people).
Experimental followup to the Fame releases; a wide spectrum of dance subgenre's (electronic club synthpop) and 80's (early 90's) pop music. Reading this sounds fascinating and adventurous; how exciting for a young gemale artist to bring back the charm of vintage pop. The main problem I have with born this way is that it's a bit overproduced too much at one time and the lyrics become less important than the music. Although the package is exploding with imagination and ideas; the production is not strong and will be forgotten. There's no focal point or direction musically or lyrically the 'throwback sound' on random songs is the album's only leg to stand on; an unorganized production. The ideas are perfect but the arrangements are'nt defining or grate! I also don't approve of the unnecessary references to christianity the best songs on the album become unlistenable. Now for the good: it's exciting to see an artist experimenting and being imaginitive even if the results aren't all that. It's all trial and error eventually a true metamorphosis woll finally take place one of these days but until then Born this way is just another experiment in this process.Influences:Tiffany Debbie Gibson GilletteDiana DeLori Vixen
Awesum totally awesum awesum totally awesumGo out and buy dis CD its da best one gaga ever put out
Despite all the artifice attributed to Lady Gaga and there is quite a bitit is undeniable that she is a gifted artist and not simply a prefab pop confection. This new album demonstrates that Lady Gaga has no intention on resting on her laurels and she is definitely going for the glory. This album is much heavierdenser and darker in sound and vibe. The three singles released from this album really did not peak my interest however within the context of the album the songs not only make sense they sound better.This album is the special edition which has 22 tracks which includes remixes. Overall this a good album however there is no less than eight throwaway tracks1. Fashion of His love (insipid)2. Highway Unicorn(The title alone makes me gag  this track is totally forgettable)3. Electric Chapel (monotonous)4. The Queen (despite an interesting musical shift toward the end of the song the beginning of the  track is generic& cliche5. All the remixes except Scheibe. the remixes drone on and are not that much fun.You are left with 14 tracks of adventurous solid pop & dance with catchy beats and lyrics. I have no doubt that Lady Gaga is on her way to fulfilling her loftiest of goals and I'm looking forward to seeing her journey continue. Mazel Gaga!!
"Simply put Amazon dropped the ball. I have stayed away from dealing with Amazon for mp3's but was swayed by the attractive $.99 deal. I also decided to finally test out their Cloud Player service. What a terrible mistake. I received ONE song for the first 2 hours then ""Judas"" became available at random 20 minutes later. No obvious reason as to why until I searched Google of course. Then I realize that Amazon is causing this problem for a host of others and does not support iOS natively for their Cloud Player.Well...what was the point of me doing this again? I didn't get the album I paid for and even when I do get the songs it's a hassle to play them natively on my multiple devices? Regardless of the ability to use CloudPlayer on my iPhone with mobile Safari (which Amazon CLEARLY states will not work) there is no excuse for a lack of an App.In the end I can only tell you: Don't bother. Stay away from Amazon wait for a more put together offering from another company (ie: Apple Google) and don't let the attractive price convince you that this is a superior deal. After 10 hours I have been given my 14 tracks which are now somewhat unattractive.Again Amazon has seen there final purchase from this customer. iTunes and Google will remain my steady reliable and more enjoyable sources. Goodbye Amazon."
Rating of album: 4 stars the previous album was much stronger than this oneAmazon Service: Do we have negative ratings? This is my first Digital purchase from amazon and of course not at all pleased. I think I'll stick to zune pass for my music..
I only received 6 of 14 songs.  I would like the rest of the album please.  Who can I call or ask to fix this?  Please help!
The product is obviously good. I could sit here and review the album but this isn't the appropriate locale for that. It's amazing by the way really & truly. Great quality. Although the $1 promo is no longer going on I'm sure the $6 one is the same thing.
Yes I was one of the people that was able to download the entire digital album for .99 and yes it only partially downloaded for me as well. In fact I only got 1 working song. That being said instead of crying about it I contacted amazon (best customer service!) and less than 24 hours later all my songs had finished downloading to the Cloud Player. I will NOT be basing my reviews on the download process which clearly was going on here on release day.Album-wise it is not as good as The Fame(Monster) but it is still very good. There's good songs and blah songs. My favorite has to be Americano. It is fun very upbeat and catchy. I also really like Judas Electric Chapel and Bloody Mary. The other songs are good nothing very memorable. There are better songs than even her cover track of Born This Way which though catchy is not as impressive as some of the other songs on here.  I very much dislike Hair and You and I which came off very country. I don't particularly care for that genre of music but other people may. Just stating my opinion. All in all this album has a wide variety of sounds and Lady Gaga herself sounds wonderful.
Here is a prime example of everything that is wrong with the music industry. Gaga is all hype all fancy packaging surrounding an empty box meant to fool the public into spending dollars on nothing. You could literally take any of a thousand women put them in strange make-up and costumes and using modern technology make them all sound exactly alike. No musical talent required. None whatsoever. This performer (I will not say singer) is strictly the choice of heavy substance abusers.
This is not a review for this item but for Amazon's Cloud service. After purchase I only had available 3 songs. Apparently many people are experiencing the same problem. I hope Amazon solves the problem soon.
It looks like I fared better than most and got 5 songs but I still want my other 9! GrrrRrrr!!! I'm hopeful that the glitch will be fixed soon and I will be able to actually hear the rest of my purchase!
Sorry but other than one or two good tracks I just can't get into this album. Had Amazon not put this for sale I would have never purchased it.
"I don't so much care or mind that Gaga wants to make a darker kind of pop than what she did on The Fame and The Fame Monster more power to her. The problem with this record however is that it is so busy overblown overhyped and self-indulgent that it borderlines on parody. She's not breaking new musical territory she's just producing a lot of 80's techno noise and techno beats and trying to sprinkle in religion and ""controversial"" political/religious topics to ""shock"" the listeners which is not only boring but irrelevant and trite. It's very difficult to tell one song from another because they all sound the same especially with the repetitive ""baby"" and ""Gaga-a-a-a-a"" crutch that she constantly has to use in her songs. Her lyrics are just laughable and incomprehensible. Her album is more of a production than it is a record. Even though the Fame/Fame Monster still had a lot of filler amongst the infectious hit tunes at least there was more to like than what we're seeing on Born This Way. The Fame/Fame Monster was fun but it was also quirky different clever and creative without trying so hard. Born This Way is a sad attempt at trying too hard with too much noise and hype. It's disappointing especially from an artist who is talented enough and famous enough that she doesn't have to try so hard to be ""different"" and ""edgy."" Sadly with all the talent that Lady Gaga has she focuses more on the image/gimmick than she does on the music. Not to mention these days she tries way too hard to force a ""message"" in her songs (ex: Hair Bad Kids Born This Way). It's not sincere it's completely self-indulgent and corny. She's focused on producing hit singles than she is at actually writing good music. The only track that was worth more than one listen is ""You and I"" (which to me sounds a little too much like Speechless but at least it showcases the style of music that Gaga SHOULD be doing showcasing those vocals the piano skills and the human side of Gaga). I hope in the future Gaga could settle with a more laid back album that displays her true musical talents than this overblow overhyped outdated disco/80's nonsense. Lady Gaga DOES have talent she CAN sing and is a phenomenal live performer the problem is that she chooses to create a show around her gimmick image and ""controversial"" statements than on her vocals and her talent."
Dear Amazon / Lady GaGaThank you so much for the price break on the album.  After finding out that my debit card information was skimmed & I have charges that are not mine I will have to fill out & file an affidavit of fraudulent charges before I can recover my funds it was not looking like a good day.  But then I cruised into Amazon lo and behold they have a brand new release for $0.99 for the entire album.  I found enough change in the cushions of the couch & was able to buy something that cheered me up.  Thanks for a great surprise ~ I sure did appreciate it.The album is great.  Thanks to everyone that had a part in the price break for a great brand new hot off the presses tunes that I am enjoying as I write this!  This is the greatest thing that has happened all day and very appreciated in the current economy!
Lady GaGa. I feel like a rebellious teenager (which I'm far from) when I listen to her! From &#34;Electric Chapel&#34; to &#34;Marry The Night&#34;...hell they're all good...
"The problem with this album is Lady Gaga doesn't want to lose her pop music fans but she wants to be alternative and original at the same time. So everything gets messed up. She wants to give everything in one box. But the box doesn't carry as much as she wants so things drop out: techno rock dance electronic music .. she wants to be perfect it seems every track was worked with effort. Gaga wants everybody listens to her music she tries to take attention of all music listeners. She wants to be a legend you can understand it with this effort.But it doesn't work; There are so many ""stolen"" melodies from 80's and 90's. In some songs pop arrangements are very powerful but they are simple and ordinary there's nothing new in it. The album makes you tired and full of hard techno ryhtms almost same in every song. You get excited with ""marry the night"" at the begining but you lose this excitement after; even if you don't want to. Gaga also wants to give social messages but this is not a concept album at the same time. It's like ""i want to tell you this this this do this this this""  with ""born this way"" ""hair"" ""bad kids"".. and when it's done; ""well lets forget it and back to have fun again"" with ""government hooker"" ""heavy metal lover"" etc.. every song is different from each other so you can not get what Gaga really wants to tell.Also the album is too long when it doesn't need to be. Because there is no special instrumantation. Acoustic instruments lost their way in songs because of the hard techno they cannot flow together.  Rock songs and electro guitar solo arrangements don't sound fresh. The guitar solo melodies are like they were written in 1980's. so where's the originality?her debut and then the fame monster were presenting more clear and certain sound and they had a concept. but btw does not have that clear presentation although it has more messages and although the changes she had through.I like Lady Gaga. She is a great artist. Born This Way is a very good pop album especially comparing with other pop albums of current time. But we need to be honest this is not ground breaking album and definitely ""not"" the album of decade. The most successful albums in history are generally ""concept"" albums and the albums that have great instrumantation. But Born This Way is a product of scatter confused mind."
"is what matters. We're getting an album by an awesome artist for $.99. Lady Gaga isn't even my usual cup o' tea but I sometimes need some get up and go music - and she gets me up! Plus... her care for her causes rock.Now as to the tech issues... hrm a slow download for $.99. Have you ever... had a problem with something that costs $.99 before? A bad cup of coffee (which probably cost more than that)? A million other things you've wasted money on?Please stop spoiling the page of an artist because you're too impatient or ""thrifty"" to deal with a slow download of an *entire* album that cost you $.99."
Gaga has done it again! This album is incredible and I can't get enough of it! From the sick dance beats of Judas to the mellowness of The Queen Born This Way has a wide range of sounds. Thank you Gaga for giving us an amazing album!
What more can I say I got this whole album for a steal! I love all the songs it was really it was like a electric pop it was really cool!
There are a number of tracks which are very good on this album. I'd originally planned on cherry picking songs but it was on sale and would have been the same price as just getting the individual songs.
My favorite's album all the time!! it's worth to get one for yourself!! it's VERY DIFFERENT kind of POP MUSIC!! SO??!! What are you waiting for?
I love the Euro-Electro-Pop music. It's great. I had some trouble downloading but I figured it out. I love most of the songs so far. I just had a change to listen to them and I love them.
I really looked forward to this release.  I wanted to like it.  I'm not a Gaga hater.  I don't understand how so many people are loving this - to each their own I guess.  If I didn't know what this was and heard it for the first time I would guess that it was by some nobody from the 80's who was never very popular.  It is just .... Cheesy.  She has lost that edgy darkness that made her former hits so unique and memorable.  I'm very sad today.  I guess they all sell out eventually.
"I love every single song on this album. Born This Way is very techno but she also plays with a little country on ""You & I"" and the results are fabulous! $0.99 for all 14 tracks is a freaking awesome deal!"
This album is a clear evolution from previous two. I love the Rock Metal and Electro theme. There's a clear take on art pop-culture fashion and religion in her latest work.
I love it it's way different then her other stuff. People need to understand this. It's a new page for Gaga. And I think it's stupid to want an Artist to always sound the same. Reinventing yourself with each album should be every artists goal not a last resort at the end of a career in hopes to smart new attention. If you want your fans to continue with you . . . then you need to evolve with them to.
Overall I love the price of this album and the Digital Booklet that comes with it.  However I am having trouble downloading 6 of the songs on the album (Marry The Night Bad Kids Highway Unicorn Electric Chapel You & I and The Edge of Glory).  It keeps stating that the download failed while the other 8 songs successfully downloaded.  I am hoping that an issue can be resolved.**EDIT:  It ended up downloading everything after a few hours.. (5/5 stars)  LOVE!
Just like the rest of her albums this is a great album. A few of the remixes are good but some aren't that great. Other than that the album over all is really good. Amazon is selling this for a really good price because Wal-Mart sells it for $17 and iTunes sells it for around $16 so I'd recommend buying it on Amazon. :]
The music is a welcome collection to get the summer going. It's worth every penny and have a little patience.
"I bought this record on the day it came out after hearing ""Judas"" and ""Born This Way"" on TV and the radio respectively.Overall I like this album. There's a lot of the writing that I find interesting. However there is very little in the way of dynamics in the production here. The final mix is so compressed and the drum hits are very much in the front. As a result a lot of the more interesting elements of the production are buried in the mix and that's a shame because like I said there's interesting ideas in the music."
GaGa you are so great and this album is actually really good thank you for making it for the fans.
"Best album in a long time from anyone. This album reminds me why I love pop. Lady Gaga reminds me why I love pop. For those who are upset that it's different I can only laugh. It should be different. It's called growth. If it was the same as The Fame/Fame Monster you'd all be yelling that it was tired & stale. Actually I would too.As for Madonna references & Madonna fans hating on her...rediculous. I couldn't be a bigger Madonna fan (multiple tattoos standing in line for days...her autograph hangs over my head as I type. I'm 40 & have been a fan from the beginning. Hating Gaga does NOT make you a better Madonna fan. Just ignorant. Even Madonna likes her! And btw Madonna has boldly ""borrowed"" from the beginning!). Every artist is influenced by the people they grew up listening to and admiring. This is not a wanna-be album! I also hear Queen Prince Springsteen The Ronettes Pat Benatar...what could be bad about that? She learned from her elders & made it her own. It's Gaga! Plus Gaga's voice sounds stronger the hooks & beats are fun the music is tight the album flows and she allowed herself to bleed emotions. Only a half-@ssed Little Monster would dislike it. And Madonna fans (who are threatened over nothing) are actually missing out. The history books are written. Madonna earned her crown. But there is room for more and we're better for it. This True Blue Madonna fan couldn't be happier with Gaga. I've got a kick @ss album to wear-out. You've got jealousy & bitterness. I win!Initial favorites were Marry The Night Government Hooker Americano & ScheiBe. However all grab me now especially the Ronettes-like styling on The Queen with it's beautiful & heartbreaking imagery & vocals. If you love pop (or use to love pop) then you owe it to yourself to get this album! I only wish I could give it more stars!PS. For the record the 2 days that Amazon sold it for $.99 was Amazon's doing. It's truly ridiculous & foolish to slam Gaga for that. They're a store and have a right to sell products for any price that they wish. They were just trying to cash in on her popularity. It's a capitalist country & they can't be faulted for that...but neither can Gaga. Grow up!"
I bought it yesterday saved it to the free Cloud here and downloaded it to iTunes today. Almost flawless! The only issue that I had was with the songs that had non-standard characters in the titles. I renamed them when I downloaded them to something a little less exotic and iTunes uploaded them with no issue.  I'm a happy little monster!!!
"They say ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery."" Well imitation is the root of pop culture. Gaga has been able to mold past works and genres into a modernized pop masterpiece in the way Madonna did back in her peak. This album will be remembered not only for it's unique presence in our current mainstream scene but for the amazing visuals shes presented with the album publicly. From the alien-esque Marilyn Manson inspired prosthetics from her Born This Way music video to the Biblical imagery of her Youtube hit Judas. I'm sure the cherry on top will happen when her worldwide tour kicks off in support of this album. This album is a melting pot of new-wave hair-metal club beats dance-pop and rock'n'roll. Only GaGa could take this big of a risk this early in her career in this day and age. GaGa is on top of her game in a way no one thought she could be in the beginning. She's come a long way from the faux-plastic pop of The Fame. She's furthering her legacy.5 STARS"
Blah. I bought this when it came out and was very excited. But then I got let down. Not my favorite and haven't listened to it since I bought it.
I heard about this being offered for 99 cents logged into Amazon to download it found it offered as promised. Took about 10 minutes to download no problems. Thanks Amazon and Lady GaGa!
"Ok there seems to be ALOT of mixed reviews for BTW. I'd like to add my thoughts to the consumer who for some reason has not yet heard the album. I wanted to wait a few days to give it a few listens before i commented on the album. First let me say if you are looking for a pure pop album like Brittany or Beyonce' your honestly not gonna find it here. This album is more like a piece of art and art has always allowed many interpretations of its meaning as does this album. In my opion there is some great pop music on this album ""edge of Glory"" ""Electric Chapel"" ""Marry The Night"" But there are also many songs that have morre of an edge to them. Some that require deep though behind the meaning (Dont always take every written word to be so literal) I think that Lady Gaga has taken what she has learned from her life what she has seen and what has influenced her (We've all heard the Madonna referances) but anyone who has grown up with a love for music in the past 20 years its hard NOT to be influenced by madonna but i digress. But I think she has taken her love for music fashion and spirit and created a piece of art that like any art some will love and some will hate. Thats the amazing thing about creation and artistry it leaves everyone to have an opinion. But if u want to jsut dance this music is good for that also. But like i said if your looking for a full album of music you would hear on you local top 40 station this album may not be for you but if your open to musical experimentation and something that may not normally listen to but can appreciate diverse beats and everything from darl tehcno to brezzy bubble pop you should give this album a try. Some say they think this album was rushed I think a lot of it was written out of stream of conciousness and inspiration and what was truely being felt when the pen touched paper (or fingers touched laptop keys whatever) and I do consider this album a work of beautiful and soul filled art"
Got it for my mom who loves lady g. Came via USPS on time and in good condition. Considering I ordered it around the holiday season I am very pleased. Don't know much about the product though haha.
All i have to say is this album is amazing she has done it again bigger and better. Writing her own music creative genius like no other singer out there. You see why a lot of other artist are trying to copy off of her.  Buy this album now if you have notWay better then britney which every song sounds the same and very very auto tuned not for gaga though!
It can take a minute or two before all the songs are available to you.  Close the Cloud Drive window exhale get a glass of water or something then check again.  It'll work I promise!  Happy Gaga day everybody.
Nothing in this sales experiment worked.  I had partial fail messages all day long on my hardwired 100M Ethernet connection.  I may have bought the album for $0.99 but spent the $12.00 savings relaunching the mp3 downloader time and time again. At the end of the day the songs aren't visible in iTunes though I seem to be able to get them to play one by one by doing a hard drive search for them.  Not exactly Internet Age.
There has been so much hype leading up to the release of Gaga's latest effort the expectations for her to deliver a great album are paramount. However from the very beginning with Marry the Night and each song thereafter those expectations and hope for a great album are let down bit by bit. Some call it more sophisticated than The Fame and Fame Monster. Yet Born This way never really delivers. There are indeed good musical ideas and gaga's vocal performance on songs shows she can really sing but the songs ultimately fall flat and end up more boring than compelling. It's too bad also that Gaga is so set on preaching her message that she failed to really deliver on the musical elements that truly make a song a good song. For those that adore Gaga this will be amazing. She will sell millions but that alone doesn't make this anything other than it is just a mediocre set of songs.
Is simple i just love this album! And the artist inside of this one is so good and I love it
Album is definitely worth $1I was totally in error about the cloud services and Amazon Music.Amazon states that digital music purchased from Amazon stored on the Amazon cloud does not count against your Cloud Storage Plan.You still need to be sure to read all the fine print before you buy and to make your selections appropriately; otherwise you just may find a surprise on your credit card bill one year from now.After downloading you can burn it to DISK but remember your meta-data is suppose to be encrypted on the music tracks....Hope this helps....  Got to love Amazon....  Super company offers and company service...
Man was I disappointed in this album.  The first album is so diverse and has great pop hooks.  This album is the exact opposite.  I knew Lady Gaga was obviously pretentious as her last cd was getting bigger but this is nothing like that.  I wanted to like it but if you want anything like The Fame just save your dollar and listen to the first one.  This one has too many religious overtones too much dance electronic pop and just a bizarre choice.
All the 1 star reviews are from the server going down. Rating her album 1 star doesnt hurt Amazon it hurts Gaga's review of her album making her album look bad.  So don't rate the 1 star if Amazon pissed you off rate it for the music if you liked or not.
What happened?  The album (not just one song) was suppose to be priced at 99-cents all day.  It shows $6.99 right now.  Bate and switch?
Born this way is great because of the diversity of songs. Dynamic building songs uptempo rock dance electronic trance...etc. Lady G's vocals are diverse and she sounds unique on every song. I predict Born this Way will stand the test of time better than Gaga's Fame albums.
I just bought the album and didn't have a single problem downloading it to Cloud or to my computer.  I don't know if this helps but maybe Amazon has fixed whatever issue there was.
My down load worked perfect with no issues.  This is the whole album for the amazing price and 15G worth of space.  Pretty kicking album to boot.  Granted it's all you are going to hear this summer but hey be first and get the best price nothing wrong with that.  Come on she has 10 million twitter followers and a great stage show.
Her voice is the voice of an angel. I could sit and listen her to from day to day and enjoy it more and more each time that I listen to her.
"after the fiasco of amazon's downloading disaster i finally got to listen to the entire album.  can't complain about the long wait (over 10 hrs!) since it WAS only 99 cents.  i'm not a big gaga fan but my 9 yr old daughter is.  i downloaded the album for her and i have to admit i like several of the songs.  as much as i want to hate lady gaga because of all the hype she delivers.  it's a very catchy and enjoyable album.  my favorite being ""the edge of glory""."
"...and frankly why would it be? ""The Fame Monster"" sounded nothing like ""The Fame"" and so it makes sense that ""Born This Way"" would sound nothing like ""The Fame Monster"". She definitely keeps experimenting with sounds and this is new territory for her - with the exception of Judas (aka - Bad Romance 2.0). There are definitely 80s and 90s vibes from many tracks as well as a rock/metal theme throughout as well but she still manages to make everything sound unique and current. Great dance music. An inspirational ""love yourself"" theme from many tracks. Overall a GREAT album and for $.99? Heck buy it even if you're just curious! It's a steal!Edit: Reviewing the album not the download difficulties. Downloaded from Gaga's site (digital physical album and vinyl) before I saw this deal. My apologies to people having trouble getting the full album downloaded!"
I'm not exactly sure why so many users are complaining -- I guess we've gotten used to digital quickness.  I just purchased this album and uploaded to the cloud.  As soon as the cloud loaded there was only 1 song available for my listening pleasure which is aligned with the folks complaining about the digital download.  After it loaded I just refreshed the page and it jumped to 6 songs available upon another refresh 8.  Folks -- it's not going to *PRESTO* have 650 megs available for you at the drop of a hat.  It takes time to move files and with the number of users Amazon has give it some time.Working fine for me -- still only 8 songs available but I have no doubt that Amazon will get the rest up there as the day goes on.  I would bet they'll all be available by the time I listen to the 8 that I have now.People get too worked up about having to wait a few minutes for something.  Just because it's digital doesn't mean it's INSTANT.  Patience is a virtue.Songs so far I've only listened to 'Judas' as I LITERALLY just purchased it but that song was pretty decent.  Americano just started playing.  Enjoy!  For .99 cents this is a great deal folks -- and have some faith -- Amazon will get it all fixed up.
I have not yet listened to the music nor would I normally buy a Lady Gaga album from what I've heard on the radio.  However at $.99 I have decided to buy and check it out.  This is the way to transition from the old music marketing system people!  Give people no reason not to listen to the music legally and then subsequent albums (and concert tickets and merchandise etc.) will reflect what the market truly is for such tunes.  Looks like a win-win for everyone albeit not the sort of thing studio execs are used to doing to wring every penny out of every possible avenue for exploiting the consumer.
Let's just say that this woman is the one person I would do anything for. Her music makes me feel good when I'm down and she is one of the most amazing performance artists of the century. The HBO Monster Ball Special is a must watch.
Bought the album for .99.  Thought it was a great deal and I'd give Amazon a try.  Never was able to download on the day it was offered.  I thought I would leave the downloader up and get it the next morning after the rush.Guess what OFFER EXPIRED and Amazon got my .99.  WTF?  Thanks Amazon I'll stick with Apple if this is the kind of Customer Service you offer.  Can't quite hang with the big boy.......
I only have to say that I would never play this haphazardly like in a car with screaming children. This album has earned my respect so I only play it in private. On full blast of course. I can't describe this album except to say that I'm lucid dreaming or something all throughout.Fantasy techno-rock. Indeed.
"Love this album! Such a great mix of different genres but sounding completely GaGa the whole time. While The Fame was quite uneven GaGa improved tremendously with The Fame Monster which didn't have one bad song. She continues the trend with Born This Way which feels more like a focused album instead of just a collection of great songs.Unfortunately she also continues the trend of allowing her record company to censor her lyrics for more sales (by not having to include a parental advisory sticker). I find this to be quite hypocritical but whatever. The word ""b!tch"" is censored in two songs though it is most noticeable/ offensive on The Queen. Why is this word constantly censored on her albums (it became ""bit"" on The Fame Monster)? It isn't censored on the radio or TV. There was even a hit song by that name in the 90's. ANYWAY. It's a fantastic album. I first downloaded the regular edition and now that I have the special edition I can say that the bonus songs should have been added to the bonus disc. They are not as strong and kind of mess up the flow of an otherwise perfect album.That said great job GaGa! If you're a 'mo like me you'll be working out to these songs for years!"
I will start by saying I love mother monsters new album! No it isn't Fame Monster part 2. Is that what people wanted? She is growing as an artist so her music must reflect that. The only issue I have is the fact that I preordered this album and put it in my cd as soon as I got it. WTF?? Bleeps during the songs? Amazon did not notify anyone on this factwhich is a huge disappointment. If I had know it was censored I would not have purchased it. I'm a grown man and i should have the choice of censored or not.So Gagas new cd is awesome but amazon... Get it together. You need to give people ALL info on a product that is pertinent. Sooo disappointed in them.
Lady gaga is the most GENIUS!! women in this planet! for so long ive waited for a true reall artist like this to come into the music industry and FINALLY MY WISH HAS COME TRUE! so i wanna start of by saying that she is my LIFE! i cannot live a day with out listening to her CD's Something  about the music she makes just makes u very happy.....i wanna say that this album is the best album of the decade  hands down! not a single song on this album i skip she was so right about all of them being hit! and already the album went platinum in just a week so proud of mother monster i love her to death like words i cannot  describe how much she means to me!
Only by coincidence while checking upon another product on Amazon a garbage disposal unit I stumbled upon an ad for Lady Gaga.  Having heard some buzz in the media and out of sheer curiosity I decided to listen to sample cuts of her albums.  To give this some justice I must admit that I am a white male in his late 50s having grown up in the 60s era of pop music.  I was astounded by how this electronic mumbo-jumbo of repetitive disco rhythms created by a synthesizer with a 2nd rate female vocal sounding more like an unrefined Madonna in an echo chamber somehow can be passed as artistic expression.  Meanwhile young people who are attracted to current pop culture are being fed and encouraged to swallow this foul 2nd rate product.
This album is amazing.I have had it since the day it came out and I am still in love with it. The highlights to me are Marry The Night Government Hooker Judas Americano Schiesse Electric Chapel and The Queen. Those are my absolute favorites but every song is amazing. Buy the album you won't be disappointed.Also a tip I learned this week listen to Heavy Metal Lover with the bass up high enough that you can feel it. :)
Am now listening to it downloaded to my computer and still had enough time to read up on DRM (boo on you guys for watermarking the download - I'll be removing that).  Thanks for easy inexpensive access to a great album!
I didn't listen to Lady Gaga's music until her interview with Oprah.  I thought of Gaga as being out of it but her music lyrics talk about societies issues we gor through every day.  I felt in love with her interest in young people her encouragement to people to accept themselves:  Born This Way has not only help people accept and love themselves just the way they are but has also given some people the confidence they have never had.  I learn she is catholic and love family.  I will recomend this CD to anyone who needs a confidence pumpped.
This is awesome.. I am switching to amazon mp3 from itunes and it is just awesome. Almost all songs are cheaper..  the cloud drive works as advertised.  Yes..the album took a little longer to showup but 99 cents!  c'mon be a little patient and it is worth it.
I really appreciate Gaga's edgy creative style but this is not close to her previous albums. It sounds more like remix disco and doesn't really stand out like her previous songs. The only ones I liked and thought stood out as not just disco were you and I and born this way. I expected more but I guess everyone has their off days.
The second cd tepid club mixes and the album art kinda gross but also interesting somewhat. For the music IMMENSE IMPROVEMENT! I really enjoyed the thoughtfuloften intense emotional even spiritual context Lady sings in. Even beyond the commercial tracks there is a consistent theme thoughtful and mature theme going on. This is the kind of music lady gaga that I know Lady Gaga is for and I.m quiet impressed by it and I find the whole album enjoyable and satisfying. I like the artwork that says 'This album is for you.' Indeed I connect with this album. Well done!
This is no longer .99!!! When I read Lady Gaga's album was only 99 cents on amazon I couldn't believe it. I thought to myself this can't be true and rushed to the website guess what? I was right it's more like 9.99. Baiting customers is not a good strategy amazon. Shame on you.
Would have paid full price for it but the $0.99 for the album was a great deal.  Absolutely love all but three of the songs.  I was looking forward to this and was not disappointed.
I LOVE this album! I truly do it's simply amazing! I happen to be a HUGE Little Monster and in extreme anticipation pre-ordered the album from Lady Gaga's online store it arrived on May 23rd (the release date) and every since there has not been a day go by without me listen to it! The beats the lyrics the music in general AMAZING! The lyrics come through so beautifully you can feel the emotion while the beats and music make it even more powerful... I was Born This Way!
It is an amazing product but comes in a cheap cardboard sleeve. I love the concert and the cds. Well worth the price...
Absolutely amazing CD! I think this is Gaga's best album to date! We need her and the world needs her message! She is empowering teaches love and acceptance for ALL. Its just a brilliant album. I think it showcases her talent and it is not your typical pop album. It shows her wide range in vocals and has a dance essence in a lot of songs.  Its simply beautiful!!! I love all of her albums but born this way is epic!
I tought this cd was hot i love just about every track  the songs were well put together and its a great workout cd .This will be a big summer hit for her .
"It's been almost four months since it's release and I still play this album daily! Truly one of the best albums of the year! Born this way the full-length follow-up to Lady GaGa's debut album The Fame and eight-track EP The Fame Monster is well on it's way to becoming as hugely successful as they have been. The album draws from a wide variety of musical influences and attitudes that come together to birth two types of tracks: hard-hitting sometimes dark club-bangers (such as second single ""Judas"") and joyous empowerment anthems (see ""Hair""). The album shows the artist's evolution over the past two years and her desire to showcase pop music as a religion of sorts with themes of self-respect personal liberty unity and non-conformity occurring again and again. This special edition includes 3 not-to-be-missed bonus tracks as well as 5 remixes that take a different look at some already amazing songs."
"Lady Gaga promised to deliver an album of the decade to her Little Monsters and she certainly did not fail at doing that. The only person who can top this album musically and lyrically is Gaga herself. There's no one like her in the game. This album is definitely not a normal pop record. She created a whole new genre of music. It has catchiness of a pop record fine-poetry-like lyrics and boldness of a rock/metal album. The music on this album is so advance and so futuristic so avant-garde. Gaga RedOne DJ White Shadow and Fernando Garibay - the musical director of the album did a great job.Even though I love every single song on this album there are a few songs that stand out from the ""rest of the crowd."" If you want to listen to a song that's completely different from everything you ever heard check out: Marry The Night Government Hooker Bloody Mary Heavy Metal Lover Electric Chapel and The Edge of Glory.Although many songs  on this record aren't very radio-friendly they have a great industry-changing potential and will for sure change and influence every upcoming pop album.Put your paws up you were Born This Way."
Even though there are some average bummer tracks collectively this is an interesting album by LG.  It's definately a dance affair like Britney's new album.  The beats are thumping hot and fresh like dance beats should b.  Lyrically it is a creative set so it's not ooh baby I love you on every song.  I think writing music is one of LG's stronger qualities.  LG is a true talent and I give her praise that she maintanes a level of artistic originality.  Here is my personal rundown of every track:Marry The Night: 5/5Born This Way: 4/5Government Hooker: 5/5Judas: 5/5Americano: 4/5Hair: 3/5Sheibe: 5/5Bloody Mary: 5/5Black Jesus Amen Fashion: 3/5Bad Kidz: 5/5Fashion of His Love: 4/5Highway Unicorn (Road 2 Love): 2/5Heavy Metal Lover: 4/5Electric Chapel: 2/5The Queen: 5/5U and I: 2/5The Edge of Glory: 2/5
