165823,'B00008H2LB,4,I agree there really isn't much of a difference between Meteora and Hybrid Theory but if you liked the first than you'll like this one.

165824,'B00008H2LB,5,MAN. this cd is.....great. i have hybrid theory and that's been one of my faves for a long time. LP stretches their boundaries in Meteora. They explore more music styles without losing their trademark sound. one can tell they put in tons of work into this album and it is well worth it! the cd comes with a thick (40-pg. as advertised) booklet with notes from the band (a plus). that booklet and the DVD gives you a little window into their world of music it also enforces the amount of work they put into this album. the only bad thing about Meteora is that it's kinda short 36 minutes long. though the quantity is small the QUALITY is high. my faves on the album so far are:Lying From You: awesome rock-rap fusion as usual. i don't like  rap but Mike is awesome. this song is one of the heavier rock songs on the album. the album overall is a bit darker than hybrid theory (which i love)Faint: i love the cool violin slides on this song. i play violin and i'm trying to figure it out! this song is one of the stylistically different ones on Meteora.Breaking the Habit: chester's voice on this song is amazing....it sorta has a driven quality about it...it pushes forward. i can easily picture it as the music playing during a scene in a movie in which someone is on a mission (building something or something). also if you're one of those weirdos who doesn't like Mike's Rap this song is free from it.Numb: wowza. what a way to end the album. it's beyond awesome. chester's voice is gorgeous at first with Mike softly muttering....then chester starts his trademark grating vocals while  Rob Brad and Phoenix rock out on the instrumentals. i LOVE THIS SONG! Joe doesn't really scratch on this song but he does on some other songs on the cd. good DJ-ing!BUY THIS ALBUM! all of the LP guys have really worked hard and the album is the result of their work. i bought this CD the day it came out and i haven't stopped listening to it since.,03 27 2003,A26DE4185N3D5C,17 yr old girl,'So Good!!!!!,'1048723200,0 \  0,1
165825,'B00008H2LB,1,After listening to both of their albums I concluded that &quot;Linkin Park&quot; are a band in need of some vocal coaching.  Not only is there music unoriginal and unchanging but also lacks vocal strength from the singer.  Being a musican myself I feel that the vocals are one of the most important elements of a band; therefore this band only deserves a minimum score of 1 from me!I do NOT recommend you spend your precious pennies on this album.,04 23 2003,A2MI40UUFA757Z,"1800s_girl ""fadedlilly""",'The band with the least,'1051056000,1 \  2,1
165826,'B00008H2LB,1,I just listened to the 1st 5 sample cuts and here's some advice:I used to listen to Led Zepplin Aerosmith etc.That was over 25 years ago.Now its occasional classical music or maybe a decent movie theme.This stuff'l wreck your brain.Just a minute OK?Don't scroll away just yet.The angry vocals will predispose you to more anger.And I'm telling you this because I've been 'there'.Now at 46 I've heard all the rock/jazz/punk/rap and all it does is shout down your conscience and prevent you from dealing with life and your own pain.I'm reviewing this because my own 17 year old wants this one and I have to tell him it won't do anything to help him grow into a real man.I'm telling you the same. (Girls with gentleness I'm telling you this trash isn't the pattern you need to follow; boys who grow up to be real men don't sound like this).These excuses for musicians probably wallow in the same epic self-doubt that many of you deal with.Go somewhere else and stop listening to rage and noise.Find sounds that are truly MUSICAL and intelligent.I'd be less than your friend if I didn't tell you the truth even though its unpopular to say it.Be good.With CareA youth worker who knows.Mike,11 8 2003,A1E2VU38OS7ALA,"""1watson2""",'Some Good Advice,'1068249600,3 \  9,1

165828,'B00008H2LB,5,Every generation has had a huge star or band to mark its era. Meteora could easily earn Linkin Park's spot in the books. Not only have they seamlessly fused rock hip-hop and techno into one you could take out one or two of those items and still have an awesome band. Chester Bennington has the greatest voice i have ever heard. Not only can he scream incredibly well (it actually sounds musical) he can go soft when he needs to. Mike Shinoda can bust a rhyme better than any other white guy (save for Eminem) and Mr. Hahn is an incredible turn-tableist. ok so heres a quick song review:1.Don't Stay-10/10-simply incredible. this is proof that linkin park could just include rock and still have an incredible band.2.Somewhere I belong-10/10-this song has some of the best lyrics of all time. period.3.Lying From You-10/10-the beat to this song is so catchy that i cant help but love it.4.Hit the Floor-10/10-basically straight rap but the chorus has an insane amount of screaming.5.Easier to Run-10/10-the chorus is impossible to get out of your head but in this case its a good thing.6.Faint-10/10-this is the song that will do it for linkin park. this is song has the best fusion of hip-hop and rock ever.7.Figure.09-9/10-awesome song. no real tune but has some cool segments.8.Breaking the Habit-8/10-this song really shouldn't have been included on Meteora but on a seperate EP. listen to it and you'll understand.9.From the Inside-11/10-this is my favorite song of all time.10.Nobody's Listening-10/10-mainly straight-out rap but the flutes in the backround are pretty cool.11.Session-4/10-can't say this is as good as Cure for the Itch or very good at all but its good break-dancing music.12.Numb-10/10-this was the song that made linkin park popular after In the End. While it doesn't capture the true nature of the band ti is still a really good song.,12 13 2004,A262IE64EOM0SU,4g0ttn1,'Quite possibly the next Van Halen or Led Zepplin,'1102896000,0 \  4,1
165829,'B00008H2LB,4,Linkin Park remains one of my favorite bands to mix rock and metal rap together. This album builds on the strengths of the previous one and adds new factors to lift it a standard higher.I particularly liked 'Numb' and 'Somewhere I belong.' The vocals and rapping go nicely together with the rockish and sometimes techno tune. 'Breaking the habit' was good though it could use some of Shinoda's rapping.But the main thing is that the lyrics are all about negative things such as giving up or being rejected. It would benefit from some deeper lyrics and perhaps a quieter more melodious song.Song music blend is fantastic 5/5 but is pulled down by the good but insufficient range of lyrics 3/5. Overall a good effort and I do recommend it to rock fans,08 7 2005,A10I28FVZ6T8B,911GT3,'Great sound ok lyrics,'1123372800,0 \  0,1
165830,'B00008H2LB,5,I haven't even bought the album.  I just think its gona be good.  I know that doesn't help those skeptical buyers but hey if your not sure then your not a linkin park fan...iatch!,04 7 2003,A26W8EDQX4HQYA,95civic,'Just buy it,'1049673600,0 \  1,1
165831,'B00008H2LB,5,I went to my local music store today and looked around.  I was thinking &quot;well I have 20 bucks and I could get anything.&quot; So I looked around some more and I basically wanted something very mainstream with some hip-hop mixed in with rock.  I looked no further than the Linkin Park section.  I found Meteora and immediatly bought it.  Don't get me wrong this is good quality mainstream but if you hate any form of hip-hop or rap I wouldn't buy this album because some of it is rap-rock influenced.  Anyways onto the review.As soon as I popped this in my Aiwa Portable CD Player and heard the first REAL song (not the first track) I was hooked.  The bass and guitars roar in your headphones if you have good ones and the production quality of the CD is overall polished.  The first track Don't Stay opens with monster riffs that are so awesome that you'll be blown away if you have your volume up loud. The cool little intro to Don't Stay is nice as it builds up higher and higher to the point where they start singing and it gets quiet then goes on rocking away.  Nice use of lyrics and rhyming by Chester (Lead vocalist).(One thing I noticed is that Mike doesn't sing too much on this track so all you Chester lovers don't skip this track.)As that track was over the next track rolled on Somewhere I belong.  As you all probably know this is one of their &quot;radio hits and its definately catchy from the beginning of the scratching and the piano which in my opinion sounds beautiful to the harder parts in the song such as halfway into the song as Chester screams his throat out.  Nice rapping by Mike.  Kudos to Mike again for the scratches.The track finally faded off and on came the next track Lying From You which is definately one of the harder songs on here.  Weird intro to the song with Mike being the DJ then onto the killer riffs and back to the weird little sound that Mike does with his DJ equipment.  Mike's rapping in this one is reminiscent of Figure.09. Chesters screams get truly deep in this song as the track tends to get harder in guitar riffs.Hit The Floor is a cool little rapish song near the beginning then Chester kicks in and screams his heartfelt lyrics out then kicking back to Mike's rapping and scratches.  This song reminds me of way back when in Hybrid Theory of the song Papercut.  Very fun to listen to.  Kudos to the nice DJing.Easier To Run starts out very slow and soft gradually building up to being one of the most melodic tracks on here.  If you liked Crawling and such by the way back when you will most likely enjoy this track.  Personally I think it's a very relaxed and layed back track to lay back and daze off to.  Good melody here.Faint is the first song I have heard from Linkin Parks new album and it was a very good one indeed.  Nice use of the looped little violin soloish thing.  Chester's voice is especially good on this song and Mikes rapping is essential on this song.  Without it this song would be nothing but a rock track that would be &quot;missing&quot; that special touch.  Great track overall especially if you're just getting into Linkin Park.Figure.09 was another of my favorites when I first heard it. Following right after Faint it blends in nicely to the track transition and has a sick beat and intro riff to it.  Very catchy and melodic.  Definately a song to check out if you're into Chester more than Mike.  Good chorus &quot;Now you've become a part of meeee.&quot; I can't get that out of my head.Breaking The Habit is a boring song to me with nothing special to spark me up and say &quot;wow that was an awesome track.&quot; I don't like the intro to it and I never did like the riffs.  Although some of it is a little catchy in the beginning it's nowhere near good enough to be called a &quot;superb track.&quot;From The Inside was a cool song with a very nice intro to the song with the riffs smashing down on the listener and then breaking into Chester's &quot;singing&quot; voice.  Mike raps along with Chester in this one and they both get their share in singing in this song.  The chorus has an exploding riff and its so catchy that I have to put this song on repeat.Nobody's Listening is...well...I don't like this song.  VERY rap influenced.  Mike raps most of the time here and there is a flute in the background.  No guitars and no drumming 'till the end.  Very boring although the beat gets me nodding my head....Session is a wicked awesome instrumental and all the scratches and drumming and such is fantastic.  Mike does a good job being the DJ here and mixing things.  Very nice beat/tune overall.That just leaves Numb my ABSOLUTE favorite on this CD.  This song is EXTREMELY catchy and chances are most people have heard it.  The intro to it is very nice going on to the most catchy melodic guitar riff ever!  Mikes rapping and Chesters screaming fit perfectly on this track. Kudos to the bass player for giving us some very good bass throughout this song and the whole album for that.  Do not skip over this track.Even though the CD clocks in at 36:41 it's still excellent quality.  Wouldn't you rather have quality over quanity. Plus there are NO filler tracks which is EXCELLENT.  Great CD to own if you're a Linkin Park fan or if you are just discovering them.

The new CD offers new tunes yet recognizable with LP fans.

165835,'B00008H2LB,1,Several months ago I saw them at Live8 and saw them perform and I was sold that this band is not metal at all. The only instrument this band needs is a dj because one thing I noticed is that no one was playing an instrument during a song and how the hell you call yourself a rock band? Any hoo the songs really got old fast and annoying which brings me to the vocalist Chester can't sing and has a pathetic girlish growl and sceaming is his only skill(sidenote doctors recommended to chester not to scream or his stomach might kill him). But the reason I stopped liking them was the album with Jay-z I hate Jay z's guts and anyone around him.

165836,'B00008H2LB,5,The easiest place to start is comparing Meteora to one of the best debut cds ever Hybrid Theory (HT).  I dont think Meteora is as solid 1 through 13 (11 songs with lyrics just like HT) but it certainly has some great songs.The first single &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; is probally one of the best on the cd.  It's very similar in setup to &quot;In the End&quot; (HT) and is about on par with it in quality.  &quot;Easier to Run&quot; &quot;Faint&quot; &quot;From the Inside&quot; &quot;Numb&quot; and others are all very good and all differ in the type of music.  It's amazing how Linkin Park can go from near heavy metal to ballads and sound good doing both.  I'm glad LP got their first single choice right this time (apologies to those that liked One Step Closer the most on Hybrid Theory...) but I was kinda disappointed that &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; may be their best song on this cd only because I've already heard it.  It took 3 singles to choose the best for HT (IMHO).Nevertheless Meteora deserves a 5 star rating because it has a variety of songs that all sound great. Linkin Park always put out songs that sound great and promote an emotional response like very few other bands can do at least this well (speaking of alternative rock/rap that is).If you like linkin park you'll love this cd and if you havent listened to linkin park before buy this and Hybrid Theory (first cd).,03 25 2003,A288KDX600F984,A.

Hybrid Theory was better. It took me by suprise. And I can still occasionly put it in. I can't put this CD in at all. It's too short for starters. YOu can't write a rap-core cd and only have it be 32 min long. not only that they are more techno. When I listen to rap-core band I don't wanna hear all these sound affects they sound like a robot. Rap-core should be in your face energy but with soothing melodies and blood curling screams. You want a good rap-core band. Listen to Limp Bizkit. They kick these guys ass rock-wise. Get three dollar bill by Limp bizkit and Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish don't get the new CD. It sucks. Fred does all of it himself. He doesn't need an extra singer to help him. The other thing I don't like about these guys is all songs sound the same. It starts off with energy with rapping or singing get into the middle of the song and has a chorus than at the end it gets really heavy and chester screams his head off.

165845,'B00008H2LB,4,A lot of people have asked me what I thought about Linkin Park's 2003 Sophmore Release 'Meteora' and the first thing I would tell them was that it was a nice follow up with some songs that can push them in a newer direction. Now a lot of you Linkin Park 'haters' who think this album was terrible won't agree with what I am about to say and that's fine. Linkin Park has a style that whether you 'love em' or 'hate em' is catchy and it works. They succesfully have combined hip-hop rock and electronica to make something that most of us enjoy hearing and they ACTUALLY care about their fans unlike most bands out there. Now back to what I was saying before about a 'newer direction'. Meteora was a necessity in Linkin Park's career because they hadn't finished experimenting with their style to a point where they could go into a 'new direction'. Sure 'Meteora' had its moments where it seemed that it was trying to repeat some of the songs from 'Hyrbid Theory' like (Easier to Run=Crawling and Somewhere I Belong=In the End) but there were other songs such as 'Faint' and 'Breaking the Habit' that helped push thier style to a new point. 'Breaking the Habit' especially is the key song that was the most diverse of all the songs from any of their albums and because of it they plan to head the way 'Breaking the Habit'  helped push them for their next album. I am a Linkin Park fan yes but I'm not gonna lie; I like their music and I liked all their albums so far but I really hope they bring something different forward for their third album because that is where true artists make/break it. But Meteora is worth buying; it's short sweet and to the point. No filler songs and a very nice expansion upon Hyrbid Theory. Even if you're skeptical about buying it because you have heard it was bad buy it anyway because why base your decision off of someone elses OPINION. You won't know for sure until you have heard it yourself.,11 19 2004,A1OYOSCVVBFRFX,"Adam R. Foskey ""ARF""",'Why Meteora sounds the way it does.,'1100822400,15 \  17,1

Does anybody feel tempted to spend 15 bucks on an album which is just 37 minutes long? But there is no denying that the album is good. Some numbers like &quot;Faint&quot; &quot;Somewhere I belong&quot; &quot;Numb&quot; and &quot;Lying to you&quot; are really great! The other songs are pretty good too but you are bound to get disappointed with the duration of the album. It's simply too short! &quot;Hybrid Theory&quot; was a much better album.It's almost as though they were in a rush to get things out. They could have stuck in there and composed some more songs on the album. That's the only ill-feeling I have about this album: it's too short! Were it bigger it would have felt a lot more satisfying.

165848,'B00008H2LB,2,"...Well here's my short little opinion on Linkin park not that anybody's probably ever going to stumble across it in the mess of 1300+ other reveiws and I'm probably not even going to say anything that hasn't been said already but... here goes.My sister plays this cd CONSTANTLY when she's driving around (I'm 14 she's 16 our parents hate driving hence she occasionally (bordering on often) drives me to after school classes and whatever I need to go to) and (semi-irrelevantly) it drives my parents crazy. I too am no particular fan (however a few songs are catchy Faint and Nobody's Listening are the ones I can think of right now) but I can see what others see in them. Just as a gentle touch or kind words produce soothing neurochemicals harsh noises screaming  produce more acidic (so to speak) neurochemicals. Neurochemicals have a large part in moods emotions even perceived mental and physical well-being. Whereas lighter music makes you feel lighter heavier music makes you feel heavier saddier angrier in a somewhat cliched word ""angstier"". The teenage demographic marketed to by such bands is usually think they are or have cause to be angsty as well and they enjoy -staying- angsty at their parents or how much their life sucks or whatever and the said neurochemicals assist the process and the lyrics embrace such feelings as well.Simply angry music keeps you angry. If that appeals to you go for it; buy this cd. For me I don't think paying $15+ for a cd containing a grand total of 2 songs I'd listen to is a wise choice. Especially when I could just copy them off my sister's. rofl.(I go for Modest Mouse and Tori Amos personally but the parents think -they're- ""satanic"" even if less ""nerve-racking"".

165849,'B00008H2LB,5,I bought the Linkin Park album w/ the dvd.  It's amazing!  It's one of the few cds that I can play all the way through withut skipping tracks.  Chester (lead vocals) has an amazing voice and the rest of the band has an awesome sound.  All I can say is go out and buy it cus It rocks!,04 1 2003,A938EAPRH626O,"""aef0088@aol.com""",'Absolutely Amazing,'1049155200,6 \  8,1
