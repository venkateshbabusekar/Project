'5555991584,5,The anthemic title track begins &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; her fourth CD release.  Wordless vocalizations and forceful percussion propel this song into the stratosphere.  &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; the lead single from this CD is typical of her earlier fare like &quot;Orinoco Flow&quot; but contains a magic all its own.  The most endearing aspect of this song is its lyrics.  Roma Ryan Enya's long time lyricist deserves much credit for her amazing lyrics on this song.  Relax and fall into the images the music and the words make together.  &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is like a hurricane to me.  It begins ominously like the calm before the storm.  It builds into a frighteningly wicked storm of immense proportions with strings and drums and vocals everywhere. Then in the middle it stops and small lull transpires while angels come down and sing to us.  Then just as suddenly the wind comes up again and we are back into the thick of things.  And then the end comes as suddenly as the beginning.  &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a beautiful ballad which is more lyrical than any other ballad Enya has produced thus far.  In this song Enya sounds very similar to her sister Maire Brennan lead singer of the group Clannad.  &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is another solo piano piece which embodies the title perfectly.  I can picture myself staring at the wide expanse of the ocean or the land from a high cliff.  &quot;China Roses&quot; is a song of love and a song of the past.  You can feel the slow moving but intensely powerful energy in the undercurrent of this song.  Beautiful synthesized sounds add to the atmosphere here.  &quot;Hope Is A Place&quot; sounds melancholy like someone has given up hope and Enya is trying to tell them that it's not too late it's never too late.  For all in love hope has a place in YOUR soul.  This is such a sweet ballad with a simplistic arrangement.  &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot; is another instrumental track which embodies its title perfectly.  The sparkling synthesizers and melodies bring to mind a late evening tea ceremony underneath a bright full moon on a late summer's eve.  &quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a soft waltz a lament if you will of something had and lost here and gone.  &quot;La Sonadora&quot; is the only Enya song to be written in Spanish and includes some unusual but effective chord changes.  A song to relax by.  &quot;On My Way Home&quot; starts off with a slow organ introduction and moves into a complex bassline as Enya travels on her journey home.  It seems as if your mind walks while listening to this song with a stop in the bridge as sweet flutes massage your tired mind.  A fabulous way to end a fabulous CD.,01 3 2001,A2EFCYXHNK06IS,"Abigail Perkins ""Abby &#34;Reads Too Much&#34...",'Enya Experiments And Succeeds,'978480000,4 \  5
'5555991584,5,Just when I thought Enya couldn't possibly get any better I found &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot;.  &quot;Trees&quot; is Enya's best album and like &quot;Watermark&quot; and &quot;Shepherd Moons&quot; each song is  a gem.  No other music conveys beauty love joy and peace the way Enya's  does and &quot;Trees&quot; is no exception.  Enya is a world treasure and  &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; is a must-have for anyone who loves her  music.,03 19 2000,A1WR23ER5HMAA9,AKB,'How to improve upon perfection.,'953424000,1 \  1

'5555991584,4,I really liked this CD especially the different languages used in it.  I  also particularily enjoyed the light refreshing feel of Enya's music this  was the first of her CDs which I've listened to and I found that Enya's  light voice does a lot for her music.,08 13 2000,A2V0KUVAB9HSYO,Alison Hight,'Loved It,'966124800,0 \  1
'5555991584,5,Enya's richly chorded style has smitten me once again.  A little bit Gregorian a lot Celtic combined with a soft well crafted execution gives us a CD anyone can enjoy and relax with.  Enya performs all the instruments and vocals on the album.  Her vocal style is willowy and sweet which blends with the synthesizer and piano accompaniment perfectly.This is great &quot;Hot Tub&quot; or massage music.  If you're not so lucky as to have both a tub and a masseuse available just try a recliner with a glass of wine.  Enya has given us more great music still with her unique perspective of flow and rhythm.  Her music remains timeless and fresh years after its release.,12 7 2001,A1J0GL9HCA7ELW,"Al the Pal ""Al the Pal""",'Another Hauntingly Beautiful Collection of Songs,'1007683200,3 \  3
'5555991584,5,"It's hard to believe ""Memory of Trees"" came out 11 years ago;it has held up well over the passage of time.It's Enya's last great album before the New Age/pop of ""Amarantine"" and ""Day without rain."" Back in 1995Enya still had her creative sparkher own voice.I agree with the reviewer who said that this is her saddest album;it is melancholybittersweetfrom the opening title song.""Memory of Trees"" is elegaic&majestic.;""Pax Deorum"" sounds like it is from a Requiem Massit is a dark threnody.Unlike the reviewer who said that this has a ""disconcerting"" blend of spirituality&sensuality;I don't find it disconcerting at all.""Anywhere is"" is a hopeful songlooking to possibilities.""Hope has a place"" is about lovebut it is up to the listener to decide if it is romanticplatonicetc.I've always had a soft spot for this song.""On my way home"" is a triumphant ending about return.This is truly a masterpiece of New Age musica must for any Enya fan!",09 12 2006,A3EBHHCZO6V2A4,"Amaranth ""music fan""",'Enya's last great album,'1158019200,3 \  3
'5555991584,3,I am an enya fan and like her cd's. on this cd I do have to skip over song 2 and 3 song 2 just sticks out like a song I would hear my kids singing so I can't listen to it for long and since I listen to this cd as I commute to sacramento Song 3 chants sacramento mayo dayo it's like another reminder that I'm commuting but besides that I really do enjoy the cd. It's just something different to listen to.,09 22 2007,A340XJYJDFSMUG,"Amazon Customer ""Arlu""",'Something Different,'1190419200,1 \  3
'5555991584,5,I'm not a huge know it all Enya fan.  But I do like her music very much.  Of the few CD's I've heard by Enya this is my favorite.  I LOVE the song Anywhere Is (track 2).  It is pleasent and uplifting.  It makes me smile and want to twirl in circles.  Maybe this doesn't help anyone else want to buy the CD but if you need some incentive: the CD is soothing and light to listen to. It would be a great CD to buy if that is the type of thing you are looking for.,12 1 2000,A3Q1J7VFGG80EK,Amber,'Memory of Trees or My favorite Enya CD,'975628800,0 \  0
'5555991584,5,This is my very favorite Enya album to date. Even writing a review of it will not come close to my inner feelings about its music. The first song the title track &quot;The Memory of Trees&quot; is the most beautiful song I've ever heard. From quiet strings to layered voices and shy piano to an orchestral-sounding climax with percussion and complex vocal parts this song is gorgeously triumphant. &quot;Anywhere Is&quot; is a catchy but beautiful song that brings to mind wandering through a maze. Another highlight of the album is &quot;Pax Deorum&quot;. The first time I heard it I thought of a group of hooded figures in a dimly-lit temple performing a ceremony. Enya shows off her low range with this piece. It is also interesting that she combines two different languages with two different religious ideas: the polytheism of the Romans (the Latin part) and the monotheism of the Christians (the Irish Gaelic part). Another tidbit: The Irish Gaelic part in &quot;Pax Deorum&quot; uses the same melody and text as the following breathtaking piece &quot;Athair ar Neamh&quot;. Being Catholic (a Christian denomination) I am sure that this song (whose title translates into &quot;Heavenly Father&quot;) has a personal meaning for Enya. &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is also another beautiful but quiet song an emotion-packed instrumental. Enya certainly proves that you can be very quiet but still display strong feelings. From the joy of &quot;China Roses&quot; to the tranquility of &quot;Tea-house Moon&quot; and the expectantcy of &quot;On My Way Home&quot; _The Memory of Trees_ is one of Enya's most wonderful works. I strongly recommend (and LOVE) this album. Brilliant!,06 25 2001,A1REP2FMPOXV4A,Andrew G.,'In a word perfection,'993427200,6 \  8
